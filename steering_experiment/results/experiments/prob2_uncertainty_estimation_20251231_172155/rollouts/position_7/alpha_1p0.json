    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit position separately\u2014units, tens, and hundreds places. Let me start by considering each position one by one.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. Here, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. Therefore, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear equally. But wait, the book has 488 pages, which isn't a multiple of 10. So, the last block might be shorter. Let me calculate how many complete blocks of 10 there are and then check the remaining pages.\n\nTotal pages: 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. That means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra pages (481-488). In each complete block, the units digit 4 appears once, and so does the units digit 8. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48. Now, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in these, the units digit 4 appears once (484) and the units digit 8 appears once (488). Therefore, adding these, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both digits appear 49 times. Therefore, the difference in the units place is 0.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, in each hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. Let's see how many hundreds we have in 488 pages.\n\nWe have four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so we have four complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488, which is 88 pages. Let me calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nIn each complete hundred (e.g., 1-100), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49), and the same for 8 (80-89). So, for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times. Since there are four complete hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 times for 4 and 40 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's look at the incomplete hundred: 401-488. The tens digit here ranges from 0 (for 401-410) to 8 (for 480-488). Let's count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Each digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which might be shorter. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. Let's see: from 401-410, tens digit is 0 (10 times); 411-420, tens digit 1 (10 times); 421-430, tens digit 2 (10 times); 431-440, tens digit 3 (10 times); 441-450, tens digit 4 (10 times); 451-460, tens digit 5 (10 times); 461-470, tens digit 6 (10 times); 471-480, tens digit 7 (10 times); and 481-488, tens digit 8 (8 times, since 488 is the 8th page in this group). So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and the digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488). Therefore, in the incomplete hundred, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times in the tens place.\n\nAdding this to the complete hundreds, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50. The total number of 8's in the tens place is 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 48 times, making a difference of 2 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is a bit different because it only changes every 100 pages. For pages 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0. For pages 100-199, it's 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4. So, let's count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n\nFirst, 8 in the hundreds place: since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can only be 0,1,2,3, or 4. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because 800-899 isn't part of the book. So, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nNow, 4 in the hundreds place: this occurs from page 400 to 488. Let's calculate how many pages that is. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, meaning the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times and 8 appears 0 times, so the difference here is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing 1 to 4 and 1 to 8, so 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So, total units digits: 48 +1=49 for both.\n\nTens place: Each complete hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 each for 4 and 8 in the tens place, so 4 hundreds would be 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, 40+10=50 for 4, and 40+8=48 for 8.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nAdding up: 49+50+89=188 for 4's, and 49+48+0=97 for 8's. The difference is 188-97=91.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages has one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks (480 pages) contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - Total 4's in units place: 49\n   - Total 8's in units place: 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - Four complete hundreds (400 pages) contribute 40 each.\n   - The remaining 88 pages (401-488) add 10 4's (441-450) and 8 8's (481-488).\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 50\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - Total 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{91}."

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let's start by counting the number of 4's in each position.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. Now, how many such sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (page 484). So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of 10 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, from 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. So, that's 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 5 blocks, so 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: Units place (49) + Tens place (50) + Hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, the units digit is 8 once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (page 488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 exist? Yes, but since the book only goes up to 488, the block 480-488 has the tens digit as 8, but only 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many full blocks of 10 are there? From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers instead of 10. So, for each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), there are 10 8's in the tens place. The last block (480-488) has 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's there.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: Units place (49) + Tens place (49) + Hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full sets of 10 (48 \u00d7 1) + 1 in the last partial set = 49\n- **Tens place:** 5 blocks of 10 (5 \u00d7 10) = 50\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 numbers (400-488) = 89\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full sets of 10 (48 \u00d7 1) + 1 in the last partial set = 49\n- **Tens place:** 4 full blocks of 10 (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 in the last partial block = 49\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 (since 488 < 800)\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me start by counting the number of 4's and 8's in each section separately.\n\nFirst, let's handle the single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears once (page 4), and the digit 8 appears once (page 8). So, in single-digit pages, 4 occurs once and 8 occurs once. So far, the count is 4:1, 8:1.\n\nNext, I'll move on to the two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place separately.\n\nStarting with the tens place for two-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 1 through 9, and the units digit can be 0 through 9. So, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, when the tens digit is 4, the units digit can be 0-9, giving us 10 numbers: 40-49. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place, the numbers would be 80-89, which is another 10 times. So, in the tens place, 4 occurs 10 times and 8 occurs 10 times.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers. Here, each digit from 0-9 appears once in each ten's group. For example, in 10-19, the units digits go from 0-9, so 4 appears once (14) and 8 appears once (18). This pattern repeats for each set of ten numbers. Since there are 9 sets of ten in two-digit numbers (10-99), each digit 0-9 appears 9 times in the units place. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. Each digit in the units place appears once every ten numbers, and there are 9 sets of ten in two-digit numbers (10-99). So, for each digit, it appears 9 times in the units place. Therefore, the digit 4 appears 9 times in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears 9 times. \n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 10-99, that's 90 numbers. Each digit 0-9 appears 9 times in the units place because 90 / 10 = 9. So, yes, 9 times each. So, in the units place for two-digit numbers, 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nAdding up the two-digit numbers, for the tens place: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times. For the units place: 4 appears 9 times, 8 appears 9 times. So, total in two-digit numbers: 4 appears 10 + 9 = 19 times, and 8 appears 10 + 9 = 19 times.\n\nWait, that can't be right because I think I might be overcounting. Let me double-check. For the tens place, 40-49: 10 times, correct. For the units place, in each ten's group, like 10-19, 20-29, etc., 4 appears once in the units place, so 9 times total. Same for 8. So, yes, 10 + 9 = 19 for both 4 and 8 in two-digit numbers. So, in two-digit pages, 4 occurs 19 times, 8 occurs 19 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because we have three places: hundreds, tens, and units. I need to count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, the hundreds digit ranges from 1 to 4.\n\n- When the hundreds digit is 1: 100-199. How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Zero, because the hundreds digit is 1. Similarly, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place here either.\n- When the hundreds digit is 2: 200-299. Same as above, 4 and 8 don't appear in the hundreds place.\n- When the hundreds digit is 3: 300-399. Again, 4 and 8 don't appear in the hundreds place.\n- When the hundreds digit is 4: 400-488. Here, the hundreds digit is 4, so every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place here because the hundreds digit is 4, not 8.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place across all three-digit numbers, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9, and the units digit can be 0-9. We need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place across all three-digit page numbers (100-488).\n\nFirst, let's consider how many complete groups of ten we have in each hundred. For example, in 100-199, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 for each ten numbers. Similarly for 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is not a complete hundred; it goes up to 488, so the tens digit in 400-488 goes from 0 up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). Hmm, so I need to handle that carefully.\n\nLet me break it down by hundreds:\n\n1. 100-199: The tens digit cycles from 0-9, each appearing 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (140-149), and 8 appears 10 times (180-189).\n\n2. 200-299: Similarly, 4 appears 10 times (240-249), and 8 appears 10 times (280-289).\n\n3. 300-399: Same pattern, 4 appears 10 times (340-349), and 8 appears 10 times (380-389).\n\n4. 400-488: Here, the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit can be 0-8 because 488 is the last page. So, for the tens digit, 4 appears in the tens place for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. However, 488 is the last page, so when the tens digit is 8, the units digit goes up to 8, not 9. So, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, and the units digit is 0-8, which is 9 numbers. So, for 4 in the tens place: 10 times (440-449). For 8 in the tens place: 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, adding up across all hundreds:\n\n- For 4 in the tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-449) = 40 times.\nWait, no, in 400-488, the tens digit for 4 is 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10. So total for 4 in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (480-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. In 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 times. So, total for 8 in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds 400-488, the tens digit can go up to 8, but does that affect the count for 4 in the tens place? Wait, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, correct. So, 4 in tens place is 10 times there, and 8 in tens place is 9 times.\n\nSo, total for 4 in tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 times.\n\nFor 8 in tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. The units digit cycles from 0-9 for each ten numbers. So, in each hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the units place. Let's break it down:\n\n1. 100-199: Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the units place. So, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n2. 200-299: Same as above, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n3. 300-399: Same, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n4. 400-488: Here, the units digit goes from 0-9 for each ten, but since we only go up to 488, let's see. The units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten, but the last ten is 480-489, but since we stop at 488, the units digit goes up to 8 in the last ten. So, in 400-488, how many times does each digit appear in the units place?\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate how many complete groups of ten we have and then handle the partial group.\n\nFrom 400-488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each ten's group (like 400-409, 410-419, etc.) has 10 numbers, except the last one, which is 480-488, which has 9 numbers.\n\nSo, the number of complete tens groups in 400-488 is 8 (400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479), each contributing 10 units digits. Then, the last group is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, contributing units digits 0-8.\n\nSo, for each digit in the units place:\n\n- For digits 0-8: In each complete ten's group, they appear once, so 8 times in the complete groups, plus once in the last partial group. So, total 9 times each.\n\n- For digit 9: It appears once in each complete ten's group, so 8 times, and does not appear in the last partial group. So, 8 times.\n\nWait, but wait: in each complete ten's group, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, for 8 complete groups, each digit appears 8 times. Then, in the last partial group (480-488), digits 0-8 appear once each, and 9 doesn't appear. So, for digits 0-8, total is 8 + 1 = 9 times. For 9, it's 8 times.\n\nSo, for the units place in 400-488:\n\n- 4 appears 9 times (since 4 is one of 0-8)\n- 8 appears 9 times (same reason)\n- 9 appears 8 times\n\nWait, but let me check that again. The units digit in 400-488:\n\nEach complete ten's group (400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479) is 8 groups, each contributing 10 numbers, so each digit 0-9 appears 8 times in the units place from these. Then, in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, the units digits are 0-8, so each digit 0-8 appears once more, making it 8 + 1 = 9 times for digits 0-8, and 8 times for 9.\n\nTherefore, in 400-488, the digit 4 appears 9 times in the units place, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nNow, adding up across all hundreds:\n\n- For 4 in the units place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\n- For 8 in the units place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because in 400-488, 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times in the units place, so total for 4: 10*3 + 9 = 39, same for 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n- Units place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nSo, total in three-digit numbers:\n\n4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 times.\n\n8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 times.\n\nWait, let me check that addition again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Hundreds: 89\n- Tens: 40\n- Units: 39\nTotal: 89 + 40 = 129; 129 + 39 = 168.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Hundreds: 0\n- Tens: 39\n- Units: 39\nTotal: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nOkay, so in three-digit numbers, 4 appears 168 times, 8 appears 78 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit:\n\n- 4: 1\n- 8: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- 4: 19\n- 8: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- 4: 168\n- 8: 78\n\nTotal for 4: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal for 8: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because I think I made a mistake in the three-digit counts. Let me double-check the three-digit counts again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488). That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), so 10*3=30, plus 10 times in 400-449, so total 40 times. Correct.\n\n- 8 appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds, so 10*3=30, plus 9 times in 480-488, so total 39 times. Correct.\n\nIn the units place:\n\n- For 4, in each of the first three hundreds, 10 times, so 30, plus 9 times in 400-488, total 39. Correct.\n\n- For 8, same as 4: 30 + 9 = 39. Correct.\n\nSo, three-digit counts are correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\nWait, but 1 + 19 is 20, plus 168 is 188. Similarly, 1 + 19 is 20, plus 78 is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about the three-digit numbers, 4 appears a lot more in the hundreds place, which skews the count higher. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the three-digit counts.\n\nWait, another way to check is to calculate the total number of digits printed and see if the counts make sense. But maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps I should recount the three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times because from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 times.\n\nIn the tens place:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times in each of 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 10 times in 400-449, totaling 40 times.\n\n- 8 appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds, and 9 times in 480-488, so 39 times.\n\nIn the units place:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds, and 9 times in 400-488, totaling 39 times.\n\n- 8 appears similarly 39 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n\n8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\nThen, adding single and two-digit:\n\n4's: 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 168 = 188.\n\n8's: 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a lot, but maybe it's correct because 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times, which is a significant boost.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the two-digit counts. Let me check that again.\n\nIn two-digit numbers, from 10-99, 90 numbers.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\n- 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 times.\n\n- 8 appears in 80-89, which is 10 times.\n\nFor the units place:\n\n- In each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, etc.), 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 such groups (10-99), so 9 times.\n\n- Similarly, 8 appears 9 times in the units place.\n\nSo, total for two-digit numbers:\n\n4's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\n8's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nSo, I think the total is indeed 188 4's and 98 8's, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately and see if the counts make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write a small program or use a formula to calculate the number of times a digit appears up to a certain number, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll stick to my previous calculations.\n\nWait, another thought: in the three-digit numbers, from 100-488, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds, tens, and units places, and similarly for 8.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use a formula for digit counting. The number of times a digit d appears from 1 to N can be calculated using a method where you consider each digit place separately, but since I'm dealing with page numbers starting at 1, I think my manual counting is accurate enough.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\nTotal 4's: 188\n\nTotal 8's: 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488. \n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - 8 appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - Tens place: 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - Units place: 4 appears 9 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n   - Total for two-digit pages: 4 appears 19 times, 8 appears 19 times.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times.\n   - Tens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n   - Units place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n   - Total for three-digit pages: 4 appears 168 times, 8 appears 78 times.\n\n**Total counts:**\n- 4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n- 8's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit position separately\u2014units, tens, and hundreds places. Let me start by considering each position one by one.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in each position.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times from the full blocks. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total 4's in units place: 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the tens digit is 4 for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, how many such blocks are there in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. Now, the remaining 88 numbers (401-488) are in the fifth block. Let's see how many times 4 appears in the tens place here. The tens digit is 4 for numbers 400-409, but since we're starting at 401, that's 401-409, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more 4's in the tens place. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: Units (48) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (89) = 48 + 49 = 97, plus 89 is 186. So, there are 186 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: As before, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 8 in the units place. So, 48 full blocks (488 / 10 = 48.8), so 48 8's from the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so the 8 appears once here (488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The tens digit is 8 for 10 consecutive numbers in each block of 100, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many full blocks of 100 do we have? 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, the fifth block is 401-488. In the tens place here, the digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since our upper limit is 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's here.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me double-check the units place for 8's. When I had the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8, so 8 appears once (488). So, that's correct. So, units place for 8's is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, in the fifth block (401-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, the total number of 4's is 186, and 8's is 98. So, the difference is 186 - 98 = 88.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, which is 10 numbers, but since the book starts at 401, that's 401-409, which is 9 numbers. Wait, no, actually, 400 is included if the book starts at 400. Wait, but the book starts at page 1, so 400 is page 400, which is included. So, from 400-409, that's 10 numbers, but since our upper limit is 488, we have 400-409, which is 10 numbers, but in the 400-488 range, 400-409 is 10 numbers, so that's 10 4's in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 9 because starting at 401. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, let me clarify. When considering the tens place in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409. So, that's 10 numbers: 400, 401, ..., 409. So, 10 4's in the tens place here. But earlier, I thought it was 9 because I started counting from 401, but actually, 400 is included as page 400, so it's 10 numbers. So, that would mean the tens place for 4's in the 400-488 range is 10, not 9. So, total 4's in tens place would be 4*10=40 from the first four blocks plus 10 from the fifth block, totaling 50. Wait, no, that can't be right because earlier I thought the first four blocks gave 40, and the fifth block gave 9, but if it's actually 10, then it's 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The first four blocks are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so that's 4*10=40. Then, the fifth block is 401-488. In this block, the tens digit is 4 from 400-409, but 400 is included, so that's 10 numbers: 400, 401, ..., 409. So, that's 10 more 4's in the tens place. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 9 because I started at 401, but that's incorrect because 400 is included as a page number. So, that's 10 numbers. So, the total 4's in the tens place is 50, not 49 as I previously thought.\n\nSimilarly, let's check the units place again. From 1-488, how many 4's in the units place? Each block of 10 has one 4, so 48 full blocks (480 pages) give 48 4's. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1-8, so no additional 4's. So, units place: 48.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's: Units (48) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187.\n\nWait, that's different from before. So, earlier I thought 4's were 186, but now I'm getting 187. Hmm, let me recalculate.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me count the hundreds digit 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nTens place: 40 in the first four blocks, plus 10 in the fifth block, so 50. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: 48.\n\nSo, 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 = 187.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 186. So, I must have made a mistake in the tens place earlier by thinking it was 9 instead of 10.\n\nNow, for the 8's, let's see. Units place: 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, which has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more, making it 49.\n\nTens place: In each block of 100, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, four blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) contribute 4*10=40. Then, in the fifth block (401-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but 480 is included as 480, so that's 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: Units (49) + Tens (49) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 8's were 98, which is correct.\n\nSo, now, total 4's: 187, total 8's: 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 186 - 98 = 88, but now I'm getting 187 - 98 = 89. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let me double-check all counts again to make sure.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 (from 1-480, each 10 numbers contributing one 4). Then, 481-488 has no additional 4's in units place.\n\n- Tens place: Each block of 100 contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 blocks (1-400) contribute 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, total tens place 4's: 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nCounting 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full blocks (1-480) contribute 48 8's. Then, 481-488 includes 488, which has an 8 in units place, so 1 more. Total units place 8's: 49.\n\n- Tens place: 4 blocks (1-400) contribute 4*10=40 8's. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 more. Total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, difference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 88. So, where did I go wrong before? I think I made a mistake in the tens place for 4's, initially thinking it was 9 instead of 10. So, the correct count is 187 4's and 98 8's, so the difference is 89.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't overcount the tens place in the 400-488 block. So, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, that's correct. So, 10 4's in the tens place there.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought earlier it was 88. Maybe I should approach this differently, perhaps by writing out a smaller example to test my method.\n\nLet's take a smaller book, say, 100 pages, and count the 4's and 8's.\n\nIn 1-100:\n\n- Units place: 10 4's (4,14,24,...,94) and 10 8's (8,18,28,...,98).\n\n- Tens place: 10 4's (40-49) and 10 8's (80-89).\n\n- Hundreds place: 0 for both.\n\nTotal 4's: 10 + 10 = 20.\n\nTotal 8's: 10 + 10 = 20.\n\nDifference: 0.\n\nWait, but according to my method, in 1-100:\n\n- Units place: 10 4's, 10 8's.\n\n- Tens place: 10 4's, 10 8's.\n\n- Hundreds: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 20, 8's: 20. Difference: 0. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's try 101-200.\n\nUnits place: 10 4's (104,114,...,194) and 10 8's (108,118,...,198).\n\nTens place: 10 4's (140-149) and 10 8's (180-189).\n\nHundreds place: 0 for both.\n\nSo, total 4's: 10 +10=20, 8's: 10+10=20. Difference: 0.\n\nSimilarly, 201-300 would have the same.\n\nNow, 301-400:\n\nUnits place: 10 4's (304,314,...,394) and 10 8's (308,318,...,398).\n\nTens place: 10 4's (340-349) and 10 8's (380-389).\n\nHundreds place: 0 for both.\n\nTotal 4's: 20, 8's: 20. Difference: 0.\n\nNow, 401-488:\n\nUnits place: From 401-488, the units digits go from 1-8 (for 481-488). So, 4's in units place: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers. Wait, but 488 is included, which is 488, so units digit 8, not 4. So, 404,414,...,484: that's 9 4's in units place (since 404 is the first, then every 10 after that, up to 484). So, 9 4's.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier method, I would have calculated units place as 48 (from 1-480) plus 9 from 481-488, but in reality, in 401-488, the units digits have 9 4's. So, perhaps my earlier method was correct.\n\nWait, but in the overall count, from 1-488, units place 4's: 48 (from 1-480) plus 9 (from 481-488) = 57? Wait, no, that can't be, because in 1-480, units digit 4's occur 48 times (4,14,...,474). Then, in 481-488, units digits go from 1-8, so 484 is included, which is another 4. So, total units place 4's: 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with my earlier count where I thought units place 4's were 48. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me clarify: from 1-480, how many 4's in units place? 480 /10=48, so 48 times. Then, from 481-488, units digits are 1-8, so 484 is included, which is another 4. So, total units place 4's: 48 +1=49.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 48. So, that's where the mistake was. So, in the overall count, units place 4's are 49, not 48.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: from 1-480, 48 times, and from 481-488, 488 is included, so 488 has an 8 in units place, so total 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, so that's different from my initial count. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial count by not including the 484 in the units place.\n\nSo, let me recast the counts.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\n- Units place: From 1-488, every 10 numbers contribute one 4, so 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 484 is included, which adds one more 4. So, total units place 4's: 48 +1=49.\n\n- Tens place: In each block of 100, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, but 400 is included, so that's 10 numbers (400-409), but 400 is already counted in the 401-488 block? Wait, no, 400 is part of the 401-488 block. Wait, no, 400 is included in the 401-488 block, but 400 is page 400, which is included. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more 4's in the tens place. So, total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nWait, that's different again. So, now I'm getting 188 4's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 187. I must be making a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nTens place: 40 from the first four blocks (1-400), and 10 from 400-409 in the fifth block, so 50. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 from 1-480, plus 1 from 484 in 481-488, so 49. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\n- Units place: From 1-488, every 10 numbers contribute one 8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\n- Tens place: In each block of 100, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers. So, from 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Then, in the fifth block (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so no 8's in hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. Difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that's different again. So, I'm confused because I keep getting different counts.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this more systematically by considering each digit position separately and making a table.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in each digit position.\n\n1. Units place:\n\nWe can calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488.\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(488/10)=48 groups. Each group contributes 1 occurrence of 4 in the units place, so 48.\n\nRemaining numbers: 488 - (48*10)=8 numbers: 481-488.\n\nIn these 8 numbers, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484).\n\nSo, total 4's in units place:48 +1=49.\n\n2. Tens place:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 100: floor(488/100)=4 groups. Each group contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nRemaining numbers: 488 - (4*100)=88 numbers: 401-488.\n\nIn these 88 numbers, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 400-409.\n\nWait, but 400 is included in 401-488? No, 401-488 starts at 401, so 400 is not included. So, the tens digit is 4 for 401-409, which is 9 numbers (401-409). So, 9 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place:40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 10, but since 400 is not included in the remaining numbers, it's only 9.\n\nWait, but 400 is page 400, which is included in the 401-488 block? No, 401-488 starts at 401, so 400 is not in this range. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 401-409, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's:40 +9=49.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n\nNumbers from 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. The count is 488 -400 +1=89 numbers.\n\nSo, 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=187.\n\nNow, let's count the 8's.\n\n1. Units place:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10:48, each contributing 1 occurrence of 8, so 48.\n\nRemaining numbers:481-488, units digits 1-8, so 8 appears once (488).\n\nTotal units place 8's:48 +1=49.\n\n2. Tens place:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 100:4, each contributing 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nRemaining numbers:401-488.\n\nIn these 88 numbers, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488).\n\nSo, total tens place 8's:40 +9=49.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n\nNo occurrences, as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nSo, total 4's:187, total 8's:98.\n\nDifference:187 -98=89.\n\nWait, that seems consistent now. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 90, but that was due to a miscalculation in the tens place. So, the correct count is 187 4's and 98 8's, so the difference is 89.\n\nI think this is the correct answer now. I must have made a mistake earlier by including or excluding certain numbers, but after carefully recounting, the difference is 89.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's than 8's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units Place:** Every block of 10 numbers contributes one 4. There are 48 full blocks (480 pages) contributing 48 4's. The remaining 8 pages (481-488) include 484, adding 1 more 4. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 4's. Four blocks (1-400) contribute 40 4's. The remaining 88 pages (401-488) include 401-409, contributing 9 more 4's. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, totaling 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n2. **Count the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to 4's, 48 full blocks contribute 48 8's. The remaining pages include 488, adding 1 more. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** Four blocks contribute 40 8's. The remaining pages include 480-488, contributing 9 more. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No 8's appear here.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - More 4's than 8's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{89}."

    "text": " Let me start by counting the number of 4's.\n\nFirst, let's consider the single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. The digit 4 appears once here, which is on page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence. The digit 8 also appears once here, on page 8. So, for single-digit pages, both 4 and 8 appear once each.\n\nNext, let's move on to the two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. I think it's easier to break this down by looking at the tens place and the units place separately. \n\nStarting with the tens place: For two-digit numbers, the tens digit can be from 1 to 9. If the tens digit is 4, then the units digit can be from 0 to 9, giving us 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Similarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place, when the tens digit is 8, the units digit can be from 0 to 9, giving another 10 occurrences. So, in the tens place, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times each.\n\nNow, looking at the units place for two-digit numbers: The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each tens digit. So, for each tens digit, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. Since there are 9 possible tens digits (1-9), that's 9 occurrences of the digit 4 in the units place. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once in the units place for each tens digit, so that's another 9 occurrences. \n\nWait, but hold on, from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers (99 - 10 + 1 = 90). For the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 9 times (since 90/10 = 9). So, yes, 9 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times, and the digit 8 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. So, same as single-digit, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each in two-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in single-digit, 4 and 8 each appear once, and in two-digit, 19 each. So total so far would be 20 for 4 and 20 for 8? Hmm, maybe, but let me check again.\n\nWait, no, in two-digit numbers, the tens digit for 4 is 10 numbers (40-49), which is 10 occurrences, and the units digit for 4 is 9 occurrences (since from 10 to 99, each units digit 4 occurs once per ten, so 9 times). So, 10 + 9 = 19 for 4. Similarly, 10 + 9 = 19 for 8. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complicated because we have three digits to consider: hundreds, tens, and units. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book ends at 488. So, let's consider each case:\n\n- Hundreds digit = 1: Pages 100-199. In this range, the hundreds digit is 1, so it doesn't affect the count of 4's or 8's. We need to look at the tens and units digits.\n- Hundreds digit = 2: Pages 200-299. Similarly, the hundreds digit is 2, so we look at tens and units.\n- Hundreds digit = 3: Pages 300-399. Same approach.\n- Hundreds digit = 4: Pages 400-488. Here, the hundreds digit is 4, so every page from 400 to 488 will have a 4 in the hundreds place. Let's figure out how many pages that is: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 occurrences of the digit 4 in the hundreds place. There are no 8's in the hundreds place here because 488 is the last page, and 488's hundreds digit is 4, not 8.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's consider the hundreds digits 1, 2, and 3. For each of these, the hundreds digit isn't 4 or 8, so we don't get any counts from the hundreds place. So, we need to look at the tens and units digits in these ranges.\n\nLet's start with hundreds digit = 1 (pages 100-199). Here, we need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens and units places.\n\nFirst, the tens place: For each hundreds digit, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9, and for each tens digit, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in the tens place, for each hundreds digit, the digit 4 appears 10 times (when the tens digit is 4, units digits 0-9). Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, for each hundreds digit, the digit 4 appears once for each tens digit. Since there are 10 tens digits (0-9), that's 10 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Same for 8: 10 occurrences.\n\nSo, for hundreds digit 1, the number of 4's is 10 (tens) + 10 (units) = 20. Similarly, 8's are 10 + 10 = 20.\n\nSame logic applies to hundreds digits 2 and 3. Each of these will contribute 20 4's and 20 8's each.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. For hundreds digit 1, pages 100-199: the tens digit can be 0-9, and for each tens digit, the units digit is 0-9. So, for each hundreds digit, the number of times a digit appears in the tens place is 10 (for each digit 0-9, 10 times each). Similarly, in the units place, each digit appears 10 times per hundreds digit.\n\nSo, for each hundreds digit (1,2,3), the count for 4's is 10 (tens) + 10 (units) = 20. Similarly for 8's. So, 3 hundreds digits each contributing 20 4's and 20 8's.\n\nWait, but wait: 100-199 is one set, 200-299 another, and 300-399 another. So, 3 sets. Each set has 100 pages. So, for each set, the count for 4's is 20, as calculated. So, 3 sets would give 3*20=60 4's from the tens and units places in the hundreds digits 1,2,3. Similarly, 60 8's.\n\nBut wait, no, actually, each hundreds digit contributes 20 4's and 20 8's, so 3 hundreds digits would contribute 3*20=60 for each.\n\nWait, but let me check again. For hundreds digit 1: 100-199. Tens digit 4: 10 numbers (140-149). Units digit 4: 10 numbers (104,114,124,...,194). So, 10+10=20 4's. Same for 8's: 10+10=20.\n\nSame for hundreds digits 2 and 3. So, 3 hundreds digits each contributing 20 4's and 20 8's. So, total 3*20=60 4's and 60 8's from these ranges.\n\nNow, let's look at the hundreds digit 4, which covers pages 400-488. As I thought earlier, the hundreds digit is 4, so each of these 89 pages contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's right there.\n\nNow, in addition to that, we need to check the tens and units digits in the pages 400-488 for occurrences of 4's and 8's.\n\nFirst, let's handle the tens place in 400-488. The tens digit can be from 0 to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488).\n\nSo, for the tens digit in 400-488:\n\n- When the tens digit is 4: Pages 440-449. That's 10 pages, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n- When the tens digit is 8: Pages 480-488. That's 9 pages (480-488), so 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 pages because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place in 400-488:\n\n- The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each tens digit. So, for each tens digit, the units digit 4 appears once. How many tens digits are there? From 0 to 8, so 9 tens digits. So, 9 occurrences of 4 in the units place.\n- Similarly, the units digit 8 appears once for each tens digit. So, 9 occurrences of 8 in the units place.\n\nWait, but wait: in 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so the units digit can be 0-9 for each of the 9 tens digits (0-8). So, yes, 9 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\nSo, in 400-488:\n\n- Tens place: 10 4's and 9 8's.\n- Units place: 9 4's and 9 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's in 400-488: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\nTotal 8's in 400-488: 9 (tens) + 9 (units) = 18.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. For the tens digit 4 in 400-488, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 4's in the tens place.\n\nFor the units digit 4 in 400-488: For each of the 9 tens digits (0-8), the units digit 4 appears once, so 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens digit 8: 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nUnits digit 8: 9 times as well.\n\nSo, yes, 10+9=19 4's and 9+9=18 8's in 400-488.\n\nBut wait, we also have the hundreds digit 4 contributing 89 4's. So, in total, for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: 89 4's.\n- Tens and units in 400-488: 19 4's and 18 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 +19=108.\n\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 60 (from hundreds digits 1-3) +18=78.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me clarify:\n\nEarlier, I calculated that for hundreds digits 1,2,3, each contributes 20 4's and 20 8's, so 3*20=60 for each.\n\nThen, in hundreds digit 4, which is 400-488, we have:\n\n- Hundreds digit: 89 4's.\n- Tens and units: 19 4's and 18 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) +19 (tens and units) =108.\n\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 60 (from hundreds digits 1-3) +18 (from 400-488) =78.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The 60 8's from hundreds digits 1-3 are only from the tens and units places, correct? Because the hundreds digit in those ranges isn't 8. So, yes, 60 8's from the tens and units in 100-399, and then 18 more from 400-488, totaling 78.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's and 8's across all page numbers.\n\nFirst, single-digit pages (1-9):\n\n- 4's:1\n- 8's:1\n\nTwo-digit pages (10-99):\n\n- 4's:19\n- 8's:19\n\nThree-digit pages (100-488):\n\n- 4's:108\n- 8's:78\n\nSo, total 4's:1 +19 +108=128.\n\nTotal 8's:1 +19 +78=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 128 -98=30.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nStarting with single-digit:\n\n- 4 appears once (page 4).\n- 8 appears once (page 8).\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place: 10 4's (40-49) and 10 8's (80-89).\n- Units place: 9 4's (14,24,...,94) and 9 8's (18,28,...,98).\n- So, total 19 each.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: each contributes 20 4's and 20 8's, so 3*20=60 each.\n- Hundreds digit 4: 89 4's in hundreds place.\n- In 400-488, tens place: 10 4's (440-449), 9 8's (480-488).\n- Units place:9 4's and 9 8's.\n- So, total in 400-488:19 4's and 18 8's.\n- So, three-digit 4's:60 +89 +19=168? Wait, no, wait.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake here. Earlier, I thought that the hundreds digits 1,2,3 contribute 60 4's and 60 8's each, but actually, each hundreds digit contributes 20 4's and 20 8's, so 3 hundreds digits contribute 3*20=60 4's and 60 8's.\n\nThen, in the hundreds digit 4 (400-488), we have 89 4's in the hundreds place, plus 19 4's from tens and units, totaling 89+19=108 4's.\n\nFor 8's in three-digit numbers: 60 from hundreds digits 1-3, plus 18 from 400-488, totaling 78.\n\nSo, total 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (108) =1+19=20 +108=128.\n\nTotal 8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) =1+19=20 +78=98.\n\nSo, 128 -98=30.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 3-digit 4's were 108, which includes the hundreds digit 4's. So, 89 from hundreds, 19 from tens and units, totaling 108.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in three-digit: 60 from 100-399, and 18 from 400-488, totaling 78.\n\nSo, yes, total 4's:128, 8's:98, difference 30.\n\nWait, but let me check again the three-digit counts because I'm a bit confused.\n\nIn hundreds digits 1,2,3 (pages 100-399):\n\n- Each contributes 20 4's and 20 8's, so 3*20=60 each.\n\nIn hundreds digit 4 (pages 400-488):\n\n- Hundreds place:89 4's.\n- Tens place:10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n- Units place:9 4's and 9 8's.\n- So, 10+9=19 4's and 9+9=18 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit:60 (from 1-3) +89 (hundreds) +19 (tens and units)=168? Wait, no, that can't be right because earlier I had 108. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up the counts.\n\nWait, no, actually, the 60 4's from hundreds digits 1-3 are from the tens and units places. The hundreds digit 4 adds 89 4's, and then in the same 400-488 range, the tens and units add another 19 4's. So, total 4's in three-digit is 60 +89 +19=168? But that seems high because the total pages are only 488.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because 60 (from 1-3) +89 (from 4) +19 (from 400-488's tens and units) would be 168, but let's check the actual counts.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach it differently.\n\nLet me consider all page numbers from 1 to 488 and count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position (units, tens, hundreds).\n\nFirst, units digit:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIn each block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, total blocks of 10:48 (since 488/10=48.8). So, 48 full blocks, each contributing 1 occurrence, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last partial block is 480-488, which includes 484, so that's one more 4 in the units place. So, total units 4's:48 +1=49.\n\nWait, but wait: from 1-488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (1-480), each contributing 4 in units once, and then 481-488, which includes 484. So, 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: same logic. Each block of 10 has one 8 in units place. So, 48 full blocks, plus 488, which is 488, so units digit 8 appears once more. So, 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 488 is included, so units digit 8 appears in 8,18,...,488, which is 49 times.\n\nWait, but in the units place, 4's and 8's each appear 49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's in units place were 9 in two-digit and 9 in three-digit, but maybe this approach is better.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use this digit-by-digit approach.\n\nSimilarly, for tens digit:\n\nIn each block of 100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, for each digit d, it appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred. So, from 1-488, how many hundreds do we have?\n\n- 1-99: two digits, so tens digit 0-9 each appear 10 times (for 10-99), but 1-9 have tens digit 0, so perhaps it's better to think in terms of full hundreds.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider:\n\n- Units digit: as above, 49 times for 4 and 49 times for 8.\n\n- Tens digit: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, in 1-488, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488.\n\nWait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488.\n\nIn each full hundred (100 numbers), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49 in 1-100, 140-149 in 101-200, etc.), so 10 times per hundred. Since there are 4 full hundreds, that's 4*10=40 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4*10=40 occurrences.\n\nNow, in the partial hundred 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 occurrences. The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total tens digit 4's:40 (from full hundreds) +10=50.\n\nTotal tens digit 8's:40 (from full hundreds) +9=49.\n\nNow, hundreds digit:\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no counts.\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so each page contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. There are 488 -400 +1=89 pages, so 89 occurrences of 4.\n\nFor 8's in the hundreds place: none, since the highest hundreds digit is 4.\n\nSo, total hundreds digit 4's:89.\n\nHundreds digit 8's:0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the counts:\n\n- Units place:4's=49, 8's=49.\n- Tens place:4's=50, 8's=49.\n- Hundreds place:4's=89, 8's=0.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier count. Earlier I thought 4's were 128, but now using this digit-by-digit approach, it's 188.\n\nWait, where did I go wrong earlier?\n\nAh, I think I missed counting some 4's in the three-digit numbers. Let me check again.\n\nIn the earlier approach, I considered:\n\n- Single-digit:1 4, 1 8.\n- Two-digit:19 4's,19 8's.\n- Three-digit:108 4's,78 8's.\n\nTotal 4's:1+19+108=128.\n\nBut using the digit-by-digit approach, it's 188 4's. So, there's a discrepancy here. I must have made a mistake in the earlier method.\n\nWait, in the digit-by-digit approach, units digit 4's:49, tens digit 4's:50, hundreds digit 4's:89. Total 49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8's:49, tens digit 8's:49, hundreds digit 8's:0. Total 98.\n\nSo, difference is 188-98=90.\n\nBut earlier, I had 128-98=30. So, which one is correct?\n\nI think the digit-by-digit approach is more accurate because it systematically counts each digit position across all page numbers.\n\nWait, let me see where I went wrong in the earlier method.\n\nIn the earlier method, for two-digit numbers, I counted 19 4's and 19 8's, which seems correct: 10 in tens place, 9 in units place.\n\nIn three-digit numbers, I considered:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: each contributes 20 4's and 20 8's, so 60 each.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4:89 4's in hundreds place, plus 19 4's in tens and units, totaling 108 4's.\n\nBut wait, in the digit-by-digit approach, the total 4's in three-digit numbers would be:\n\n- Hundreds digit 4:89.\n\n- Tens digit 4: in 400-488, 10 (from 440-449) + in 100-399, 3*10=30 (since each hundred has 10 4's in tens place).\n\nWait, no, in the digit-by-digit approach, the tens digit 4's in three-digit numbers are 50, which includes 40 from the first four hundreds (100-400) and 10 from 400-488.\n\nWait, perhaps in the earlier method, I didn't account for all the 4's in the tens place across all three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, in the earlier method, for three-digit numbers, I considered:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: each contributes 20 4's, which includes both tens and units.\n\nBut in reality, in the digit-by-digit approach, the tens digit 4's in 100-399 are 3*10=30, and in 400-488, it's 10, so total 40. Similarly, units digit 4's in 100-399 are 3*10=30, and in 400-488, it's 9, so total 39.\n\nWait, but in the digit-by-digit approach, units digit 4's are 49, which includes 39 from three-digit and 10 from one and two-digit? Wait, no, let's think.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to stick with the digit-by-digit approach, which seems more systematic and less error-prone.\n\nSo, using the digit-by-digit approach:\n\n- Units digit 4's:49.\n\n- Tens digit 4's:50.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4's:89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nUnits digit 8's:49.\n\nTens digit 8's:49.\n\nHundreds digit 8's:0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but this contradicts my earlier count. I must have made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, let me check the units digit count again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIn each block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, that's 48 blocks of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, in 481-488, the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: same logic, 49 times.\n\nTens digit:\n\nIn each block of 100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40 times. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total tens digit 4's:40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place: in each hundred, 10 times, so 4*10=40. In 401-488, tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, total 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds digit:\n\nFrom 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, so 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nSo, difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 30, but that was due to an error in the initial approach. Now, using the digit-by-digit approach, the answer seems to be 90.\n\nBut wait, let me check with another method to confirm.\n\nAlternative approach: For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits digit:\n\nAs above, 49 times each.\n\nTens digit:\n\n4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nHundreds digit:\n\n4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 30, but now it's 90. I must have made a mistake in the initial approach by not considering all the 4's in the three-digit numbers properly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try another way. Let me list out the counts again.\n\nUnits digit:\n\n- 4's:49.\n\n- 8's:49.\n\nTens digit:\n\n- 4's:50.\n\n- 8's:49.\n\nHundreds digit:\n\n- 4's:89.\n\n- 8's:0.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the initial approach was flawed because I didn't account for all the 4's in the three-digit numbers, especially in the hundreds place and in the tens place beyond the 400-488 range.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Digit:**\n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences.\n   - 8 appears similarly, with 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens Digit:**\n   - 4 appears 10 times in each hundred (e.g., 40-49). Across 4 full hundreds (1-400), that's 40 times. In 401-488, it's an additional 10 times, totaling 50.\n   - 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, totaling 40 times in 1-400, plus 9 times in 480-488, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Digit:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSumming up:\n- **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me try to count the occurrences of each digit in each position separately.\n\nStarting with the units place: For the digit 4, how many times does it appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Wait, but 484 is within 488, so that's okay. So, how many such sets are there? From 1 to 488, that's 488 numbers. Divided by 10, that's 48 full sets and 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full set, 4 appears once in the units place, so 48 times. Now, the extra 8 numbers: 481-488. The units digits here are 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place: Using the same logic, in each set of 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, 48 times from the full sets. Now, the extra 8 numbers: 481-488. The units digits here go up to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. For the digit 4 in the tens place: The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-489 isn't fully included because we stop at 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nEach block of 100 numbers has a set where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-400, there are four such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). Each block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 times. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's another 10 numbers, so total 40 + 10 = 50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I count from 1-400, each hundred has a 40-49 block. So, 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, and 340-349 another 10. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, 440-449 is another 10, so total 50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the tens place: Similarly, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, let's count. Each hundred has a 80-89 block, which is 10 numbers. From 1-400, that's four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, total 40 + 9 = 49 times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. For the digit 4 in the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me sum up the occurrences:\n\nFor digit 4:\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\nFor digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place for 4: 48 times. For 8: 49 times. That seems right because from 1-480, 48 times, and 488 adds one more, making it 49.\n\nTens place for 4: 50 times. For 8: 49 times. That seems correct because from 400-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 instead of 10.\n\nHundreds place: 89 times for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nAdding up: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. 49 + 49 = 98. 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place, in 440-449, that's 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, 40 from the first four hundreds and 10 from 440-449, totaling 50 for 4's in tens place. For 8's, in 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 40 from the first four hundreds plus 9, totaling 49.\n\nUnits place: For 4, 48 times. For 8, 49 times.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's total 187, 8's total 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about the units place for 8, it's 49, which includes 488. So, that's correct.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit's occurrence in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (48 full sets of 10, with no additional 4's in the remaining 8 numbers).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (48 full sets plus one in 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with an additional 9 times in 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit position separately\u2014units, tens, and hundreds. Let me think about each position one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for each block of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks of 10, and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). So, in the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times, but I have to check the extra 8 pages. Wait, no, actually, each digit in the units place appears 48 times for each digit, but for the last partial block (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears once in each full block, so 48 times, plus once in the last partial block (484), so total 49 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once in each full block, 48 times, plus once in the last partial block (488), so 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digit in 488 is 8, so yes, 49 times for 8. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. Hmm, but wait, let me check that again. If there are 48 full blocks of 10, that's 480 pages, and then 8 more pages (481-488). So, in the units place, for each digit from 0-9, they appear 48 times in the first 480 pages. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total for units place: 48 +1 =49 for 4, and 48 +1=49 for 8. So, units place: 49 each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, ..., 9 for 90-99. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred. Now, how many hundreds are in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). So, for each digit in the tens place, in the first 400 pages, each digit appears 4 times 10 = 40 times. Now, let's look at the last 88 pages (401-488). The tens digits here go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but we only go up to 488). Wait, 488 is page 488, so the tens digits in 401-488 are from 0 to 8. Specifically, 401-410: tens digit 0, 411-420: tens digit 1, ..., 481-490: tens digit 8, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times do they appear? For 0: 10 pages (401-410), so 10 times. Similarly, 1: 10 (411-420), ..., up to 8: 8 pages (481-488). So, in the tens place for 401-488, each digit from 0 to 8 appears as follows: 0 appears 10 times, 1 appears 10, 2 appears 10, ..., 8 appears 8 times. So, for the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times (from 401-410), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (from 481-490, but only 8 pages). Wait, no, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears from 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times. So, in the tens place, for the last 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times (401-410), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, total for the tens place: 40 (from first 400 pages) +10=50 for 4, and 40 +8=48 for 8. So, tens place: 50 for 4, 48 for 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, in 1-99, there's no hundreds digit. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4. So, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place? For 1: 100 pages (100-199), so 100 times. For 2: 100-299, another 100 times. For 3: 100-399, another 100 times. For 4: 100-488, which is 488 - 400 +1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, what about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 89 times for 4, 0 times for 8.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit position.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 +50 +89 = let's see, 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 +48 +0 = 97.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 -97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nStarting with units place: 49 each for 4 and 8. That seems correct because each digit appears once every 10 pages, and there are 48 full tens, plus one more in the last 8 pages for both 4 and 8.\n\nTens place: For 4, I had 50, which is 40 from the first 400 pages and 10 from 401-410. For 8, it's 40 from the first 400 pages and 8 from 481-488, so 48. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 doesn't appear at all. So, 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nAdding them up: 49+50+89=188 for 4, and 49+48+0=97 for 8. The difference is 188-97=91.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for the last 88 pages. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but only up to 488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times do they appear? For 0: 10 times (401-410). For 1: 10 (411-420). Similarly, up to 7: 10 each. For 8: 8 times (481-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 401-410, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 times. So, yes, that part is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: For each digit position, count how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a more systematic approach. Let me try that.\n\nFor a given digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated using the formula:\n\ncount = higher * 10^lower_digits + something based on the current digit.\n\nBut perhaps for this problem, since the number isn't too large, breaking it down as I did before is manageable.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (including both 400 and 488). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 8 doesn't appear because the book ends at 488, so no pages from 800-899. So, 0 times for 8 in hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, for the last 88 pages, 481-488, the tens digit is 8, but only for 8 pages, so 8 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (401-410) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, in the tens place, 4 has 50 total, 8 has 48.\n\nUnits place: 49 each.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\n8's total: 49 +48 +0=97.\n\nDifference: 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the units place correctly. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nWell, every 10 pages, 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, that's 480 pages, which is 48 blocks of 10, so 48 times. Then, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once at 484. So, total 49 times. Similarly, 8 appears once every 10 pages, so 48 times, plus once at 488, making 49 times. So, units place is correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 1-400, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place. Then, from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (401-410), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, 4's tens place: 40+10=50, 8's tens place:40+8=48.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's total is 49+50+89=188, 8's total is 49+48+0=97. The difference is 188-97=91.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting digits, especially in different positions, it's easy to miscount. Let me try another approach to verify.\n\nAnother way is to iterate through each page number and count the digits, but that would be tedious for 488 pages. Alternatively, maybe I can use a formula for each digit position.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is given by:\n\ncount_units = (N // 10) + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nWait, but actually, it's more accurate to say that for each digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place up to N is (N // 10) + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think.\n\nActually, for the units digit, each digit 0-9 appears exactly N//10 times, and then an additional 1 if the remainder (N%10) is >= d. But wait, for d=0, it's a bit different because 0 doesn't appear in the units place for numbers 1-9. So, maybe it's better to adjust for that.\n\nWait, perhaps a better formula is:\n\nFor units digit d (where d \u2260 0), the count is (N // 10) + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0). But for d=0, it's (N // 10) because 0 doesn't appear in the units place for numbers 1-9.\n\nBut in our case, we're looking for digits 4 and 8, so d=4 and d=8, both non-zero. So, for units digit 4:\n\ncount_units_4 = (488 // 10) + (1 if (488 % 10) >=4 else 0)\n= 48 + (1 because 8 >=4)\n=49\n\nSimilarly, for units digit 8:\n\ncount_units_8 =48 + (1 because 8 >=8)\n=49\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nFor the tens digit:\n\nThe formula is a bit more involved. The number of times digit d appears in the tens place up to N is:\n\ncount_tens = (N // 100) * 10 + min(max(N % 100 - d*10 +1, 0), 10)\n\nWait, maybe that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, for each hundred block, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for N=488, the number of complete hundreds is 4 (1-400), so 4*10=40 times for each digit in the tens place up to 400. Then, from 401-488, we need to see how many times each digit appears in the tens place.\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but only up to 488). So, for digit 4 in the tens place, it's from 401-410, which is 10 pages. For digit 8, it's from 481-488, which is 8 pages.\n\nSo, total for tens place:\n\n4's:40 +10=50\n\n8's:40 +8=48\n\nWhich matches what I had before.\n\nFor the hundreds digit:\n\nEach hundred block contributes 100 times the digit in the hundreds place. So, for N=488, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 times for 4. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n\n4's:89\n\n8's:0\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's total:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's total:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=97\n\nDifference:188 -97=91\n\nSo, I think that's correct. Therefore, there are 91 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately, we find that the digit 4 appears 188 times, while the digit 8 appears 97 times. The difference is 91.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{91}."

    "text": " Let me start by counting the number of 4's first.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9): The only single-digit page number with a 4 is page 4. So, that's one 4.\n\nNow, moving on to two-digit page numbers (10-99). I think I should consider the tens place and the units place separately. \n\nFor the tens place: The two-digit numbers where the tens digit is 4 are from 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place.\n\nFor the units place: The two-digit numbers where the units digit is 4 are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers because 44 has already been counted in the tens place, but wait, no, in the units place, each of these has a 4 in the units, so that's 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 44 would have both a 4 in the tens and units place, so when I count the tens place, I counted one 4, and in the units place, I also count the 4 in 44. So, for two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nWait, but 44 is included in both counts, so does that mean I'm double-counting? No, because when I count the tens place, each number from 40-49 has a 4 in the tens, so that's 10, and when I count the units place, I'm looking at every 10th number, so 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94, which is 9 numbers because 44 is already in the 40-49 range. Wait, but 44 is included in both counts, so in the units place, it's the 4th number after 40, so 44 is part of both. So, does that mean I have 10 in the tens and 9 in the units, making 19? Or is it 10 in the tens and 9 in the units, but 44 is counted twice? Hmm, no, because in the units place, I'm considering all two-digit numbers where the units digit is 4, regardless of the tens digit. So, from 10 to 99, that's 9 occurrences in the units place (14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94). So, 10 in the tens and 9 in the units, totaling 19 4's in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because there are three places: hundreds, tens, and units. I need to count how many times 4 appears in each place.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. However, when the hundreds digit is 4, the range is from 400 to 488.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place: \n\n- When the hundreds digit is 1, the number ranges from 100 to 199. The hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's here.\n- Similarly, when the hundreds digit is 2 (200-299) or 3 (300-399), no 4's in the hundreds place.\n- When the hundreds digit is 4 (400-488), each number in this range has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9, and we need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nLet's break this down by hundreds:\n\n- For hundreds digit 1 (100-199): The tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149). Since there's only one hundred here (100-199), that's 10 occurrences.\n\n- Similarly, for hundreds digit 2 (200-299): The tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (240-249). So, another 10.\n\n- For hundreds digit 3 (300-399): Similarly, 10 occurrences (340-349).\n\n- For hundreds digit 4 (400-488): Now, this is a bit different because the range doesn't go up to 499. So, the tens digit 4 would be from 440-449, but we have to check if 449 is within 488. Since 449 is less than 488, yes. So, that's 10 numbers (440-449). But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit can go up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, when the tens digit is 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 10 (100s) + 10 (200s) + 10 (300s) + 10 (400s) = 40.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. Similarly, the units digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, the units digit is 4 once every 10 numbers.\n\nAgain, breaking it down by hundreds:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1 (100-199): For each ten (e.g., 100-109, 110-119, etc.), the units digit is 4 once. There are 10 tens, so 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2 (200-299): Similarly, 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3 (300-399): 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4 (400-488): Now, from 400-488, how many times does the units digit 4 occur? Well, every 10 numbers: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, but 484 is within 488, so that's 9 occurrences? Wait, no, let me count properly.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, starting at 404, then 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 404 is the first, and each subsequent is +10, up to 484. Wait, but 484 +10 would be 494, which is beyond 488, so yes, only 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds digit 4, the units digit 4 occurs 9 times.\n\nSo, total units digit 4's in three-digit numbers: 10 (100s) + 10 (200s) + 10 (300s) + 9 (400s) = 39.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Because in the hundreds digit 4, the units digit 4 occurs 9 times, not 10, because 488 is the last page. So, yes, 9.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place 89, tens place 40, units place 39. So, total 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nSingle-digit: 1\nTwo-digit: 19\nThree-digit: 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit: The single-digit page number with an 8 is page 8. So, that's one 8.\n\nTwo-digit numbers (10-99):\n\nTens place: Numbers where the tens digit is 8 are from 80 to 89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: Numbers where the units digit is 8 are 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 numbers because 88 is already counted in the tens place, but wait, no, in the units place, each of these has an 8 in the units, so that's 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 88 is included in both counts, so when I count the tens place, I have 10, and in the units place, I have 9, making 19 8's in two-digit numbers. But wait, 88 is counted twice, once in the tens and once in the units. So, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nThree-digit numbers (100-488):\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, when the hundreds digit is 8, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can't be 8. So, no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: Let's break it down by hundreds.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1 (100-199): The tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (180-189). So, 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2 (200-299): Similarly, 10 occurrences (280-289).\n\n- Hundreds digit 3 (300-399): 10 occurrences (380-389).\n\n- Hundreds digit 4 (400-488): The tens digit is 8 for numbers from 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nUnits place: Again, breaking down by hundreds.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1 (100-199): For each ten, the units digit is 8 once. There are 10 tens, so 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2 (200-299): 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3 (300-399): 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4 (400-488): Now, units digit 8 occurs every 10 numbers. So, from 400-488, the units digit 8 occurs at 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included.\n\nSo, units place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but let me check: From 400-488, how many times does the units digit 8 occur? 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Yes, that's 9 times.\n\nSo, total units place 8's: 39.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place 39 and units place 39, so 78.\n\nNow, total 8's in all page numbers:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\nTwo-digit: 19\nThree-digit: 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, let me check again. Because in three-digit numbers, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me recalculate the three-digit 8's.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, there are no 8's because the book only goes up to 488, so hundreds digit is 1,2,3,4. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nTens place:\n\n- 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10\n- 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10\n- 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10\n- 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 (since 488 is included)\nTotal tens place 8's: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 100-199: 108,118,...,198 \u2192 10\n- 200-299: 208,218,...,298 \u219210\n- 300-399: 308,318,...,398 \u219210\n- 400-488: 408,418,...,488 \u21929\nTotal units place 8's: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, three-digit 8's: 39 (tens) +39 (units)=78.\n\nAdding single and two-digit:\n\nSingle-digit:1\nTwo-digit:19\nThree-digit:78\nTotal 8's:1+19=20; 20+78=98.\n\nSo, total 8's:98.\n\nEarlier, I had total 4's as 188.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because I might have made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, when I counted the 4's in three-digit numbers:\n\nHundreds place:400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTens place:100-199:140-149 \u219210\n200-299:240-249 \u219210\n300-399:340-349 \u219210\n400-488:440-449 \u219210\nTotal tens place 4's:40.\n\nUnits place:\n\n100-199:104,114,...,194 \u219210\n200-299:204,214,...,294 \u219210\n300-399:304,314,...,394 \u219210\n400-488:404,414,...,484 \u21929\nTotal units place 4's:39.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168 in three-digit.\n\nAdding single and two-digit:1+19=20; 20+168=188. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\nTwo-digit:19\nThree-digit:78\nTotal:98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the difference was 90, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 8's in three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, let me recount the 8's in three-digit numbers.\n\nTens place:\n\n- 100-199:180-189 \u219210\n- 200-299:280-289 \u219210\n- 300-399:380-389 \u219210\n- 400-488:480-488 \u21929 (since 488 is included)\nTotal:39.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 100-199:108,118,...,198 \u219210\n- 200-299:208,218,...,298 \u219210\n- 300-399:308,318,...,398 \u219210\n- 400-488:408,418,...,488 \u21929\nTotal:39.\n\nSo, 39+39=78 in three-digit.\n\nAdding single and two-digit:1+19=20; 20+78=98.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the three-digit units place for 4's. Let me check again.\n\nIn the hundreds digit 4 (400-488), the units digit 4 occurs at 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 4's in the units place for 400-488.\n\nSo, yes, units place 4's in three-digit:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\nWait, but let me check once more.\n\nTotal 4's:188\nTotal 8's:98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me start by counting the 4's first.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: 1 to 9. The only single-digit number that has a 4 is 4 itself. So, that's one occurrence of the digit 4.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: 10 to 99. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers 40-49 have 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4.\n\nFor the units place: In every set of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. Since there are 9 sets of ten in the two-digit numbers (10-99), that's 9 occurrences of 4 in the units place.\n\nSo, total 4's in two-digit numbers are 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex. I think I should break it down into hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're going up to 488, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens and units digits can only go up to 88. Hmm, so I need to be careful when the hundreds digit is 4.\n\nBut maybe I can handle each digit place separately.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place: I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place for all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488. Let's break this down by hundreds.\n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each of these hundreds groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) will have a full set of tens digits. In each of these, the tens digit 4 appears in the numbers 140-149, 240-249, 340-349. Each of these sets has 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences per hundred group. There are three such groups (1, 2, 3), so 3 * 10 = 30 occurrences.\n\nNow, for the hundreds digit 4 (400-488): The tens digit 4 appears in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place for three-digit numbers are 30 + 10 = 40.\n\nNow, the units place: Similarly, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the units place for all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488. Again, let's break this down by hundreds.\n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each hundred group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has 10 occurrences of 4 in the units place. For example, in 100-199, the units digit 4 appears in 104, 114, 124, ..., 194. That's 10 times. Since there are three such groups, that's 3 * 10 = 30 occurrences.\n\nFor the hundreds digit 4 (400-488): The units digit 4 appears in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place here? Let's see: starting from 404, each 10 numbers, so 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 404 + 10*8 = 484, and the next would be 494, which is beyond 488. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 4's in the units place for three-digit numbers are 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but let me check that. For the hundreds digit 4, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? The first is 404, then every 10 numbers: 414, 424, etc., up to 484. So, the number of such numbers is (484 - 404)/10 + 1 = (80)/10 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9. So, yes, 9 occurrences. So, total units place 4's are 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place 89, tens place 40, units place 39. So, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nNow, let me add up all the 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (correct).\n\nTwo-digit: tens place 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 4's. Units place: 4 in 14, 24, ..., 94. That's 9 numbers, so 9 4's. Total 19 (correct).\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's.\n\nTens place: For hundreds 1,2,3: each has 10 4's in the tens place, so 3*10=30. For hundreds 4: 440-449: 10 numbers, so 10 4's. Total tens place: 40.\n\nUnits place: For hundreds 1,2,3: each has 10 4's in the units place, so 3*10=30. For hundreds 4: 404, 414,...,484: 9 numbers, so 9 4's. Total units place: 39.\n\nSo, total three-digit 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. Adding up: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I think I'll need to do a similar process.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: 1-9. The only single-digit number with an 8 is 8 itself. So, one occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers: 10-99. Counting 8's in tens and units places.\n\nTens place: Numbers 80-89 have 8 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\nUnits place: In every set of ten (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the units digit 8 appears once. There are 9 sets (10-99), so 9 occurrences.\n\nTotal two-digit 8's: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nThree-digit page numbers: 100-488. Again, breaking down into hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nTens place: Counting 8's in the tens place for all three-digit numbers.\n\nFor hundreds digits 1,2,3,4: Each hundred group will have numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n\nFor hundreds 1,2,3: Each has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8: 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. So, 3 * 10 = 30 occurrences.\n\nFor hundreds 4: Numbers 480-488. The tens digit is 8, so how many numbers? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 occurrences.\n\nTotal tens place 8's: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nUnits place: Counting 8's in the units place for all three-digit numbers.\n\nFor hundreds digits 1,2,3,4: In each hundred group, the units digit 8 appears once every ten numbers.\n\nFor hundreds 1,2,3: Each has 10 occurrences (e.g., 108,118,...,198 for hundred 1). So, 3 * 10 = 30.\n\nFor hundreds 4: Numbers where units digit is 8: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Wait, but 488 is included, so how many are there? Let's see: starting at 408, each 10 numbers: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 408 + 10*8 = 488, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total units place 8's: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nTherefore, total three-digit 8's: tens place 39 + units place 39 = 78.\n\nAdding up all 8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) = 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems a bit low. Let me check again.\n\nSingle-digit: 8 occurs once.\n\nTwo-digit: tens place 80-89: 10 8's. Units place: 4,14,...,94: 9 8's. Total 19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nTens place: hundreds 1,2,3 each have 10 8's in tens place (180-189, etc.), so 3*10=30. Hundreds 4: 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 8's. Total tens place: 39.\n\nUnits place: hundreds 1,2,3 each have 10 8's in units place (108,118,...,198), so 3*10=30. Hundreds 4: 408,418,...,488: 9 numbers, so 9 8's. Total units place: 39.\n\nSo, three-digit 8's: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Sometimes it's easy to miscount, especially in the three-digit numbers.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1.\n\nTwo-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTens place: 30 (hundreds 1,2,3) + 10 (hundreds 4) = 40.\n\nUnits place: 30 (hundreds 1,2,3) + 9 (hundreds 4) = 39.\n\nTotal three-digit 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1.\n\nTwo-digit: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nTens place: 30 (hundreds 1,2,3) + 9 (hundreds 4) = 39.\n\nUnits place: 30 (hundreds 1,2,3) + 9 (hundreds 4) = 39.\n\nTotal three-digit 8's: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, but let me check the three-digit units place for 4's again. For hundreds 1,2,3: each has 10 numbers with 4 in units place, so 3*10=30. For hundreds 4: from 404 to 484, stepping by 10: 404,414,...,484. How many is that? Let's see: 404 is the first, then 414 (10 more), 424 (20 more), 434 (30 more), 444 (40 more), 454 (50 more), 464 (60 more), 474 (70 more), 484 (80 more). So, that's 9 numbers, as I thought. So, 9 units place 4's in hundreds 4.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place for hundreds 4: 408,418,...,488. That's 9 numbers, correct.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488. \n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- Single-digit: 1 occurrence (page 4).\n- Two-digit: 10 (40-49) + 9 (14, 24, ..., 94) = 19.\n- Three-digit:\n  - Hundreds place: 89 (400-488).\n  - Tens place: 30 (140-149, 240-249, 340-349) + 10 (440-449) = 40.\n  - Units place: 30 (104, 114, ..., 394) + 9 (404, 414, ..., 484) = 39.\n- Total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- Single-digit: 1 occurrence (page 8).\n- Two-digit: 10 (80-89) + 9 (18, 28, ..., 98) = 19.\n- Three-digit:\n  - Tens place: 30 (180-189, 280-289, 380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 39.\n  - Units place: 30 (108, 118, ..., 398) + 9 (408, 418, ..., 488) = 39.\n- Total 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me start by counting the number of 4's.\n\nFirst, let's consider single-digit page numbers. These are from 1 to 9. The only single-digit number that has a 4 is 4 itself. So, there's one 4 in the single-digit numbers. Similarly, for 8, the single-digit number is 8, so that's one 8. So far, 4's count is 1 and 8's count is 1.\n\nNext, let's move on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place and the units place separately.\n\nStarting with the tens place: For two-digit numbers, the tens place can be 1 to 9. If the tens digit is 4, then the numbers are from 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, if the tens digit is 8, the numbers are from 80 to 89, which is another 10 numbers, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place: In two-digit numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each ten. So, for each ten (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 14, 24, etc.), and the same for 8 (18, 28, etc.). Since there are 9 sets of ten in two-digit numbers (10-99), the digit 4 appears 9 times in the units place, and the same goes for 8. Wait, no, actually, from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of 10. So, for each set, 4 appears once in the units place, so 9 times total for 4. Similarly, 8 appears 9 times in the units place.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. And for 8's, it's 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. For the tens place, 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. For the units place, in each ten (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the units digit cycles through 0-9, so 4 appears once per ten, and there are 9 tens (10-99), so 9 times. Similarly for 8. So, yes, 10 + 9 = 19 for both 4 and 8 in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because we have three digits: hundreds, tens, and units. I need to consider each place separately.\n\nLet's start with the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book only goes up to 488. So, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nFirst, for the hundreds place: How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book doesn't go beyond 488, so the hundreds digit is only up to 4.\n\nNow, the tens place in three-digit numbers: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9, and for each of those, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, for each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (like 140-149, 240-249, etc.), and similarly for 8.\n\nBut since our book goes up to 488, we have to be careful for the hundreds digit 4. So, let's break it down:\n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each of these has 100 numbers (100-199, 200-299, 300-399). In each of these, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149), so that's 10 times per hundred. Similarly, for 8, it's 10 times per hundred. Since there are three such hundreds (1, 2, 3), that's 3 * 10 = 30 times for 4 in the tens place, and 30 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the hundreds digit 4 (400-488), the tens digit can be 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 4, the numbers are from 440 to 449. That's 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place for the hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, total for the tens place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- For 4: 30 (from hundreds 1-3) + 10 (from 400-449) = 40\n- For 8: 30 (from hundreds 1-3) + 9 (from 480-488) = 39\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For hundreds 1, 2, 3, each has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4, so 3 * 10 = 30. For hundreds 4, when tens digit is 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. So, 30 + 10 = 40 for 4's in tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place: hundreds 1,2,3 each have 10 numbers where tens digit is 8, so 30. For hundreds 4, when tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is included). So, 30 + 9 = 39 for 8's in tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, for each hundred, the units digit cycles from 0-9, so for each hundred, the units digit is 4 exactly 10 times (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194). Similarly, for 8, it's 10 times per hundred.\n\nBut again, we have to consider the hundreds digit 4 separately because the book ends at 488.\n\nFirst, for hundreds digits 1,2,3: Each has 100 numbers, so for each hundred, the units digit is 4 exactly 10 times, and 8 exactly 10 times. So, 3 hundreds * 10 = 30 for 4's and 30 for 8's.\n\nNow, for hundreds digit 4 (400-488), the units digit cycles from 0-9, but we have to go up to 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nFrom 400 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, for each ten (like 400-409, 410-419, etc.), the units digit is 4 once. How many tens are there? From 400-488, that's 9 tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-489). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the units digit cycles 0-8 in this case. So, in 480-488, the units digit goes from 0 to 8, so 4 appears once (484). So, in each ten, 4 appears once, except possibly the last one if it's cut short.\n\nWait, let me think again. From 400 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten except possibly the last one if we don't complete the ten. So, 400-409: units 0-9, so 4 appears once (404). 410-419: 414, etc. Up to 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so units digits 0-8. So, in 480-488, 4 appears once (484). So, how many tens are there? From 400-488, that's 9 tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488). So, each ten contributes one 4 in the units place, except the last one, which is incomplete but still has 484. So, 9 times in total for 4 in the units place in the hundreds digit 4.\n\nWait, no, actually, from 400-488, the number of tens is 9 (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488). Each of these tens has a units digit 4 once, except the last one, which is 480-488, which still includes 484, so yes, 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place in hundreds digit 4: Each ten from 400-409, 410-419, etc., up to 480-488, each has a units digit 8 once, except the last one, which is 480-488. So, in 480-488, units digit 8 is at 488, which is included. So, each ten contributes one 8 in the units place, so 9 times.\n\nWait, but 400-409: 408 is included, so that's one 8. Similarly, 410-419: 418, etc., up to 480-488: 488. So, 9 times for 8 in the units place.\n\nSo, for hundreds digit 4:\n\n- Units digit 4: 9 times\n- Units digit 8: 9 times\n\nTherefore, total for units place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- For 4: 30 (from hundreds 1-3) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39\n- For 8: 30 (from hundreds 1-3) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. For hundreds digits 1,2,3, each has 100 numbers, so units digit 4 appears 10 times per hundred, so 3*10=30. For hundreds digit 4, units digit 4 appears 9 times, so total 30+9=39. Same for 8's: 3*10=30 + 9=39.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n- Units place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n- 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nNow, let's add up all the digits from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal 4's = 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal 8's = 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nWait, let me double-check that:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Single:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit:168\nTotal: 1+19=20, 20+168=188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Single:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit:78\nTotal:1+19=20, 20+78=98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's, so 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with single-digit:\n\n- 4:1, 8:1. Correct.\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place: 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n- Units place: For each ten (10-19, etc.), 4 appears once, so 9 tens, 9 times. Same for 8.\n- So, 10+9=19 for both. Correct.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. 8 never appears here. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Hundreds 1,2,3: each has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4, so 3*10=30. Similarly for 8:30.\n- Hundreds 4: tens digit 4 is 440-449:10 numbers, so 10 for 4. Tens digit 8 is 480-488:9 numbers, so 9 for 8.\n- So, total for tens place: 30+10=40 for 4, 30+9=39 for 8. Correct.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- Hundreds 1,2,3: each has 10 numbers where units digit is 4, so 3*10=30. Same for 8:30.\n- Hundreds 4: units digit 4 appears 9 times (404,414,...,484). Units digit 8 appears 9 times (408,418,...,488). So, 9 each.\n- Total for units place:30+9=39 for 4, 30+9=39 for 8. Correct.\n\nSo, three-digit counts:\n\n- 4's:89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units)=168\n- 8's:0 (hundreds) +39 (tens) +39 (units)=78\n\nAdding up all digits:\n\n4's:1+19+168=188\n\n8's:1+19+78=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly for three-digit numbers, especially the units place in hundreds digit 4. From 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nLet's list them:\n\n404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for 8's in units place:408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times. Correct.\n\nAnd in the tens place for hundreds digit 4, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 times for 4, and 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times for 8.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds places. Let me start by counting the number of 4's in each position.\n\nFirst, for the units place. In every set of ten numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1 to 10, the number 4 is in the units place once. Similarly, from 11 to 20, the number 14 has a 4 in the units place, and so on. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks of ten and then an extra 8 pages (481 to 488). In each of the 48 blocks, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, 484 ends with a 4. So that's one more. So total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, each of these 10 numbers has a 4 in the tens place. So that's 10 times. Similarly, from 140-149, another 10 times, and so on. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're starting from page 1, the first block where the tens digit is 4 is from 40-49, which is in the 0 hundreds (i.e., 1-99). Then, in the 100s, it's 140-149, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So how many blocks is that? From 40-49: 1 block, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50. Now, after 449, the next block would be 540-549, but since we're only going up to 488, we don't include that. So, the tens place contributes 50 4's.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. So, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. Starting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in each block of ten, the units digit 8 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many blocks of ten are there? As before, 48 full blocks and an extra 8 pages. Each block contributes one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. In the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So that's one more. So total units place 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place for 8's. Similar to the 4's, in each block of 100, the tens digit 8 appears in the range 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's see how many blocks that is. From 80-89: 1 block, 180-189: another, 280-289: another, 380-389: another, and 480-488: which is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 more. So total tens place 8's would be 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place for 8's. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 8's.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. To find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract 98 from 188: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's in the tens place, I had 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. That seems right. For the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Units place: 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus 484, which is one more, so 49. So 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's, units place: 48 full blocks, 48, plus 488, so 49. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. Total tens place 8's: 40+9=49. Hundreds place: 0. So total 8's: 49+49=98. So 188 - 98 = 90. That seems correct.\n\nI think that's the answer. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference. \n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** Each block of 10 contributes 1 occurrence. With 48 full blocks and one extra (484), total = 49.\n- **Tens place:** Each block of 100 contributes 10 occurrences. Five such blocks (40-49, 140-149, etc.) total = 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 contribute 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** Each block of 10 contributes 1 occurrence. With 48 full blocks and one extra (488), total = 49.\n- **Tens place:** Each block of 100 contributes 10 occurrences for the first four blocks, and 9 for the last partial block (480-488). Total = 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit position separately\u2014units, tens, and hundreds places. Let me start by considering each position one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. Units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once. How many such sets are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, I think it's 48 full sets, and then the remaining 8 numbers (481-488). In each of the 48 full sets, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484). So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check that. If I'm counting from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is actually the number of times 4 is in the units digit. So, for every 10 numbers, it's once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, the last partial set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers, and in that, 484 has a 4 in the units place. So, yes, 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place gives 49 fours.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, for the tens digit. The tens digit is 4 for numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included. Let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nEach block of 100 numbers has a decade where the tens digit is 4. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488?\n\nFrom 1-99: 40-49, which is 10 numbers.\n\nFrom 100-199: 140-149, another 10.\n\nFrom 200-299: 240-249, another 10.\n\nFrom 300-399: 340-349, another 10.\n\nFrom 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10.\n\nWait, but 488 is beyond 449, so 440-449 is fully included. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check again. 40-49: yes, 10 numbers. 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So that's 5 times 10, which is 50. So, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n1. Units place: Similar to fours, in each set of 10, 8 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. So, 48 times. Then, the last partial set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. The units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 488 is included, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So yes, 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, for the tens digit being 8. This occurs in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 eights in the tens place, and the last one contributes 9 eights.\n\nWait, let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights.\n\n180-189: another 10.\n\n280-289: another 10.\n\n380-389: another 10.\n\n480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 in all these, so 9 eights.\n\nSo, total eights in the tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me count again: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total 98 eights.\n\nWait, but earlier, for fours, I had 188 fours. So, the difference would be 188 -98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, for fours in the hundreds place, I had 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place:49, tens:50, so 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor eights: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0, so 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly for the tens place in eights. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for fours in the tens place, I had 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for fours, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for fours again. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 has a 4, so one more, total 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the units place: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digit 8 appears once (488), so total 49. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my counts are correct. So, 188 fours and 98 eights, so 188 -98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me just think if there's any other place I might have missed. For example, in the hundreds place for eights, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers from 800-899, so no eights in the hundreds place. So, that's zero.\n\nSimilarly, in the hundreds place for fours, it's only from 400-488, which is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for eights again. From 480-488, the tens digit is 8, right? 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, 10 in each of the four previous decades, plus 9, so 49.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. The number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98, so 188 -98=90. Therefore, 90 more fours are printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each 10 consecutive numbers contribute one '4'.\n   - Total sets of 10 up to 488: 48 full sets, contributing 48 '4's.\n   - Remaining numbers (481-488): one '4' (484).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - '4' appears in the tens place in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 '4's, except possibly the last.\n   - Total: 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - '4' appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each 10 consecutive numbers contribute one '8'.\n   - Total sets of 10 up to 488: 48 full sets, contributing 48 '8's.\n   - Remaining numbers (481-488): one '8' (488).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - '8' appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four ranges contribute 10 each, last contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have '8' in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for each occurrence of a digit in the units place, how many times does it appear? Well, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there?

Now, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8. So, in these, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). Therefore, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, in the units place, they're equal. \n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, up to 9 for 90-99. So, in each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, from 1 to 488, how many hundreds are there? Well, 488 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). Wait, no, actually, 488 is 4 full hundreds (each 100 pages) plus 88 pages. But let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? It's 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages from 401-488. So, in each of the 4 complete hundreds, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (40-49 in each hundred). Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (80-89) in each hundred. So, in 4 hundreds, 4 appears 4*10 = 40 times, and 8 appears 4*10 = 40 times. Now, the remaining 88 pages (401-488) have tens digits from 0 to 8. Let's see: 401-409: tens digit is 0; 410-419: tens digit is 1; ...; 480-488: tens digit is 8. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? It's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 401-488 is only up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here. For 8, in the tens place, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages. Therefore, total in tens place: 4 appears 40 + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 40 + 9 = 49 times. So, 4 has 50, 8 has 49 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. Each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) has the hundreds digit fixed. So, in the hundreds place, how many times does 4 appear? From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. How about 8? Well, 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = Let me calculate that: 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake in counting.\n\nStarting with the units place: For 488 pages, units digit cycles every 10. 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, each contributing 1 to both 4 and 8, so 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units total: 48+1=49 for 4, same for 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. 4 hundreds give 4*10=40 for each. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-8. For 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 40+10=50 for 4, 40+9=49 for 8. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: Only 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, which is 89 numbers. 8 never appears here. So, 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nAdding up: 49+50+89=188 for 4, and 49+49+0=98 for 8. Difference is 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears is calculated by considering each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately. Similarly, the same is done for the digit 8. After counting in each place, the total occurrences are summed up. Finally, subtracting the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's gives the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Units Place:** In every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 fours. The last 8 numbers (481-488) include another 4 (484). Total: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** In every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. There are 4 complete hundreds, contributing 40 fours. The last 88 numbers (401-488) include another 10 fours (440-449). Total: 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times. Total: 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears 49 times.\n   - **Tens Place:** In every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times. The last 88 numbers include 9 eights (480-488). Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 8 never appears in the hundreds place here. Total: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me start by counting the number of 4's.\n\nFirst, let's handle the single-digit page numbers. These are from 1 to 9. The digit 4 appears once here, which is on page 4. The digit 8 also appears once on page 8. So, in single-digit pages, both digits appear once each. So, the count so far is 4:1, 8:1.\n\nNext, I need to consider the two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. I can think of each two-digit number as having a tens place and a units place. I'll need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. The same goes for 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4 in two-digit numbers. In the tens place, the numbers are 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. In the units place, 4 appears in 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 times because 44 has two 4's, but I think I should count each occurrence. Wait, no, for units place, each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, etc.) has one 4 in the units place, except maybe the 40-49 group, but no, in the 40-49 group, the tens place is 4, but the units place is still 4 once (44). So, from 10-99, for units place, 4 appears 9 times (14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94). So, total 4's in two-digit numbers are 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, so maybe I'm missing that. Let me recount. From 40-49, the tens place is 4, which is 10 times. Then, in the units place, 4 appears once in each ten's group except 40-49, but wait, in 40-49, the units place still has a 4 in 44. So, from 10-99, the units place has 4's in 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94, which is 9 times. So, 10 + 9 = 19 4's in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow for the digit 8 in two-digit numbers. In the tens place, 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. In the units place, 8 appears in 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 times. So, total 8's in two-digit numbers are 10 + 9 = 19 times. Wait, but 88 has two 8's, so does that affect the count? Let me check. For units place, from 10-99, each ten's group has one 8 in the units place, except maybe 80-89, but no, 80-89 still has 8 in the units place once (88). So, 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98: that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 8's.\n\nWait, but 88 has two 8's, so shouldn't that add an extra count? Hmm, maybe I'm not counting correctly. Let me think. When I count the tens place, 80-89 gives 10 8's in the tens place, including 88. Then, in the units place, 88 is already counted in the tens place, but when I count the units place, 88 will have another 8. So, in the units place, 88 is the 9th occurrence, but it's actually the 9th because 18,28,...,88,98. So, 88 is the 9th, but it's the only one with two 8's. So, total 8's in two-digit numbers would be 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19, but since 88 has two 8's, the total is actually 19 + 1 = 20? Wait, no, because when I count the tens place, 80-89, each of those 10 numbers has an 8 in the tens place, including 88. Then, in the units place, 88 is counted again as the units digit. So, the total number of 8's is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19, but since 88 contributes two 8's, the total is actually 19 + 1 = 20. Wait, no, because in the units place, 88 is just one occurrence, but it's the 9th in the units place. So, maybe the total is 10 + 9 = 19, but 88 adds an extra, making it 20. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me list all the two-digit numbers and count the 8's. From 10-99, how many 8's are there? For the tens place, 80-89: 10 numbers, each has an 8 in the tens place, so 10 8's. For the units place, in each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, etc.), there's one 8 in the units place, except in 80-89, where we've already counted the tens place. So, from 10-79, each ten's group has one 8 in the units place: that's 7 groups, so 7 8's. Then, in 80-89, we have 88, which has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. Then, from 90-99, another 8 in 98. So, total units place 8's: 7 + 1 + 1 = 9. So, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. But wait, 88 has two 8's, so shouldn't that be 19 + 1 = 20? No, because when I count the tens place, I already included 88's tens digit, and when I count the units place, I included 88's units digit. So, 88 contributes two 8's, so the total is 10 + 9 = 19, but since 88 is counted twice, the actual total is 19, because each 8 is counted once. Wait, no, because 88 has two 8's, so the total number of 8's is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19, but 88 is one of the units place 8's, so the total is 19, not 20. Because 88 is counted once in the tens place and once in the units place, but it's the same number. So, the total number of 8's is 19. Similarly, for 4's, it's 19.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's in two-digit numbers were 19, and 8's also 19. So, in two-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each. So, so far, total 4's: 1 (single-digit) + 19 = 20. Total 8's: 1 + 19 = 20. So, they are equal so far. But let me make sure.\n\nWait, no, in single-digit, 4 appears once, 8 appears once. In two-digit, 4 appears 19 times, 8 appears 19 times. So, total up to two-digit numbers: 4's = 1 + 19 = 20, 8's = 1 + 19 = 20. So, they are equal.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is where it might get more complicated because each page number now has hundreds, tens, and units digits. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each of these positions.\n\nLet me start by considering the hundreds place. Since the book has 488 pages, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, pages 100-199 have hundreds digit 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in the hundreds place. Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. That's 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, how about the 8's in the hundreds place? Since the hundreds digit goes up to 4, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, let's count the number of 4's and 8's in the tens place across all three-digit numbers (100-488).\n\nFor the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in each ten's group. Let's break it down by hundreds.\n\nFirst, for 100-199: The tens digit can be 0-9, so each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 200-299: same thing, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\nFor 300-399: same, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\nFor 400-488: The tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for tens digits 0-8, each appears 10 times except for 8, which appears 9 times because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, let me think. From 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. For each tens digit, the number of times it appears is 10, except for the last one if the range doesn't complete the ten. Wait, 400-488 includes 488, so the tens digit for 480-488 is 8, and that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, for tens digit 8 in 400-488, it appears 9 times. All other tens digits (0-7) appear 10 times each.\n\nSo, for 400-488:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 10 numbers (400-409)\n- Tens digit 1: 10 (410-419)\n- ...\n- Tens digit 7: 10 (470-479)\n- Tens digit 8: 9 (480-488)\n\nSo, for 4's in the tens place in 400-488: Since 4 is one of the digits from 0-7, it appears 10 times.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place in 400-488: 9 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place across all three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-199: 10\n- 200-299: 10\n- 300-399: 10\n- 400-488: 10\nTotal: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 times.\n\nSimilarly, total 8's in the tens place:\n\n- 100-199: 10\n- 200-299: 10\n- 300-399: 10\n- 400-488: 9\nTotal: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, that seems correct because in 400-488, the tens digit 8 only appears 9 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, let's break it down by hundreds.\n\nFor 100-199: Each units digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred. So, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\nSame for 200-299 and 300-399.\n\nFor 400-488: Each units digit from 0-9 appears how many times? Let's see. For each tens group (e.g., 400-409, 410-419, etc.), the units digit cycles through 0-9. But since we're only going up to 488, the last group is 480-488, which only goes up to 8 in the units place. So, for 400-488:\n\n- For tens digits 0-7: each has 10 numbers (units 0-9), so 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in each of these tens groups.\n- For tens digit 8: units digits go from 0-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). Wait, no, let me think again.\n\nWait, for each tens group in 400-488:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 400-409: units digits 0-9, so 4 appears once (404), 8 appears once (408).\n- Tens digit 1: 410-419: same, 414 and 418.\n- Similarly, up to tens digit 7: 470-479: 474 and 478.\n- Tens digit 8: 480-488: units digits 0-8, so 484 and 488.\n\nSo, for each tens group from 0-7, in the units place, 4 appears once, 8 appears once. There are 8 such tens groups (0-7), so 8 times each. Then, for tens digit 8, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total in 400-488:\n\n- 4's in units place: 8 (from tens 0-7) + 1 (484) = 9\n- 8's in units place: 8 (from tens 0-7) + 1 (488) = 9\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because in each tens group from 0-7, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so 4 and 8 each appear once per tens group. There are 8 tens groups (0-7), so 8 times each for 4 and 8. Then, in tens group 8 (480-488), units digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total 4's in units place in 400-488: 8 + 1 = 9. Similarly, 8's: 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in units place across all three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-199: 10\n- 200-299: 10\n- 300-399: 10\n- 400-488: 9\nTotal: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nSimilarly, total 8's in units place:\n\n- 100-199: 10\n- 200-299: 10\n- 300-399: 10\n- 400-488: 9\nTotal: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, but in 400-488, units place for 4 and 8 each appear 9 times, as calculated. So, adding up, 4's in units place: 39, 8's in units place: 39.\n\nNow, let me summarize the counts for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4's: 89 (from 400-488)\n  - 8's: 0\n- Tens place:\n  - 4's: 40\n  - 8's: 39\n- Units place:\n  - 4's: 39\n  - 8's: 39\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nWait, let me check that again. Hundreds place: 89 4's, 0 8's. Tens place: 40 4's, 39 8's. Units place: 39 4's, 39 8's. So, adding up:\n\n4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, 4's appear 168 times, 8's appear 78 times.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's and 8's from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nSingle-digit:\n- 4's: 1\n- 8's: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n- 4's: 19\n- 8's: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n- 4's: 168\n- 8's: 78\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nWait, let me add them again:\n\n4's:\n1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 1 + 19 = 20 + 168 = 188\n\n8's:\n1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 1 + 19 = 20 + 78 = 98\n\nSo, total 4's printed: 188\nTotal 8's printed: 98\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188 - 98 = 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the three-digit counts because that's where most of the difference comes from.\n\nIn three-digit numbers, hundreds place: 4's=89, 8's=0\nTens place: 4's=40, 8's=39\nUnits place: 4's=39, 8's=39\n\nSo, 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nSo, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Single-Digit Pages (1-9):**\n   - Digit 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - Digit 8 appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-Digit Pages (10-99):**\n   - **Digit 4:**\n     - Tens place: 40-49 (10 times).\n     - Units place: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94 (9 times).\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19 times.\n   - **Digit 8:**\n     - Tens place: 80-89 (10 times).\n     - Units place: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98 (9 times).\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19 times.\n\n3. **Three-Digit Pages (100-488):**\n   - **Digit 4:**\n     - Hundreds place: 400-488 (89 times).\n     - Tens place: Each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has 10 occurrences, and 400-488 has 10 (since 484 is included).

    "text": " Let me try to visualize this.\n\nMaybe I should consider each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. That way, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position and then sum them up. Let's start with the units place.\n\nFor the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and a partial group of 8 numbers (481-488). In each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same for 8 (8, 18, 28, etc.). So, in 48 complete groups, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the same for 8's. Now, in the partial group from 481-488, the units digits are 1 through 8. So, in this partial group, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, which is 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. That means the count is equal here, so no difference from this position.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? There are four complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then the partial hundred from 401-488. In each complete hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for four complete hundreds, the number of 4's in the tens place is 4 * 10 = 40, and the same for 8's, which is 40.\n\nNow, let's check the partial hundred from 401-488. The tens digit here goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-488. Now, we're interested in how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. The digit 4 appears once in the tens place in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once in the tens place in 480-489, but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, so that's 9 numbers, right? Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480 is included, so 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so 9 times. Hmm, but wait, 480 is the first page in this range, so the tens digit is 8 from 480 to 488, which is 9 pages. So, in the tens place for the partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). Therefore, in the tens place, the total number of 4's is 40 (from the four complete hundreds) plus 10 (from the partial hundred) = 50, and the total number of 8's is 40 (from the four complete hundreds) plus 9 (from the partial hundred) = 49. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times, so that's one more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, meaning 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit position.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = Let's calculate: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nStarting with the units place: 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, in the last partial group, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For each complete hundred, 10 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40 each. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, adding those, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. That seems right.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (from 400 to 488), and 8 doesn't appear at all. So, 89 for 4 and 0 for 8.\n\nAdding up: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 for 4's. For 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these 89 pages, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the tens place in the partial hundred again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages, correct. When the tens digit is 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages, correct. So, yes, 10 and 9 respectively.\n\nSo, 50 for 4's in tens place and 49 for 8's. So, the total 4's are 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188, and 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, that seems like a lot, but let me think if that makes sense. Since 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times, that's a significant number. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all, so that's a big difference right there. Then, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times more than 8 in that partial hundred, contributing to the difference. So, yes, 90 seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: How many times does each digit appear in each position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately and then compare.\n\nLet me try that approach to cross-verify.\n\nCalculating number of 4's:\n\nUnits place: For each 10 numbers, 4 appears once. From 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 4 appears once (484). So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For each 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). There are four complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, etc.), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\nUnits place: Similarly, each 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, 48 complete groups, 48 times. In the last partial group (481-488), 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: Each 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. Four complete hundreds, so 4*10=40. In the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, total tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place since the book only goes up to 488, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that confirms my earlier result. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now. So, the final answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each 10 numbers contribute one 4 and one 8.\n   - Complete groups: 48 \u2192 48 each.\n   - Partial group (481-488): 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total: 4's = 49, 8's = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each 100 numbers contribute 10 4's and 10 8's.\n   - Complete groups: 4 \u2192 40 each.\n   - Partial group (401-488): 4 appears 10 times (440-449), 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total: 4's = 50, 8's = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear.\n   - Total: 4's = 89, 8's = 0.\n\nSumming up:\n- Total 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Total 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me try to approach this systematically.\n\nMaybe I should consider each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. That way, I can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each position across all page numbers.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4), and 8 appears once (page 8). Similarly, in 11-20, 4 appears once (page 14), and 8 appears once (page 18), and so on.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). So, in each of these 48 blocks, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. That would give 48 times each. But wait, I also need to consider the last partial block from 481-488. Let me check how many 4's and 8's are in the units place here. Pages 481-488 have units digits from 1 to 8. So, 484 has a 4 in the units place, and 488 has an 8. So that's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Therefore, total units place 4's would be 48 (from complete blocks) + 1 (from partial block) = 49. Similarly, units place 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the count for units place is equal for both digits.\n\nNext, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in every block of 100. For example, in 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So, in each block of 100, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an extra 88 pages (401-488). So, in each of these 4 blocks, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place. That's 4*10 = 40 times each. Now, the partial block from 401-488: let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. The tens digit in 401-488 ranges from 0 to 8. So, looking for when the tens digit is 4 or 8. The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 4 appears 10 times. The tens digit is 8 in 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is only 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So, 480-488: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 pages where the tens digit is 8. So, in the partial block, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). Therefore, the total tens place counts would be: 4's: 40 (from complete blocks) + 10 (partial block) = 50. 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. The hundreds digit cycles every 100 pages. For page numbers 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, which we can ignore since we're only considering page numbers as printed once, so 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit. Starting from 100, the hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, let's count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in page numbers 400-488. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, does 8 ever appear in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, the count for 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, adding up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing 1 to 4 and 1 to 8. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) add 1 each, so total 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each complete block of 100 contributes 10 to 4 and 10 to 8. 4 blocks give 40 each. Then, in the partial block (401-488), 440-449 gives 10 to 4, and 480-488 gives 9 to 8. So, 40 +10=50 for 4, and 40 +9=49 for 8. That looks right.\n\nHundreds place: Only 400-488 have hundreds digit 4, which is 89 pages. 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0. Correct.\n\nAdding up: 49+50+89=188 for 4's, and 49+49+0=98 for 8's. 188-98=90. So, the difference is 90.\n\nI think that's correct, but let me just think if I considered all cases properly. Did I count correctly in the tens place for the partial block? From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449 (10 times) and 8 from 480-488 (9 times). Yes, that seems right because 480-488 is 9 pages, not 10, since 488 is the end.\n\nAnother thing to check: Did I count the hundreds place correctly? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages. 488 - 400 = 88, but since both ends are inclusive, it's 89. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nI think I've covered all the digit positions and all the page ranges. So, the total number of 4's printed is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately:\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each block of 10 pages contributes one '4' and one '8'.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 pages.\n   - Total '4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total '8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each block of 100 pages contributes ten '4's and ten '8's.\n   - There are 4 complete blocks and a partial block from 401-488.\n   - In the partial block, '4' appears 10 times (440-449) and '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total '4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total '8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - '4' appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   - '8' never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total '4's: 89.\n   - Total '8's: 0.\n\nSumming up:\n- Total '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Total '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me start by counting the number of 4's.\n\nFirst, let's consider single-digit page numbers: 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears exactly once, on page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence. Now, moving on to two-digit numbers: 10 to 99. Here, each number has a tens place and a units place. I can break this down into two parts: the tens digit and the units digit.\n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers: The tens digit can be 1 through 9. The digit 4 will appear in the tens place for the numbers 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place.\n\nFor the units place in two-digit numbers: The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each ten. So, in each set of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 sets of ten in the two-digit numbers (10-99), so that's 9 occurrences of the digit 4 in the units place.\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19.\n\nNow, for the single-digit numbers, we had 1 occurrence. So, total 4's so far are 1 + 19 = 20.\n\nWait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Because when I considered two-digit numbers, from 10 to 99, that's 90 numbers, right? So, 9 sets of ten, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 9. And the tens place from 40-49 gives 10. So, 19 in two-digit numbers. Plus the single-digit 4, so total 20. That seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers: 100 to 488. These are the page numbers from 100 onwards. Each three-digit number has hundreds, tens, and units places. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, let's consider each hundred separately.\n\n- Hundreds digit is 1: Pages 100-199. In this range, the hundreds digit is 1, so it doesn't contribute any 4's or 8's. So, we can ignore the hundreds place for 1-3 in the hundreds digit.\n\n- Hundreds digit is 2: Pages 200-299. Similarly, the hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's or 8's here.\n\n- Hundreds digit is 3: Pages 300-399. Again, hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's or 8's here.\n\n- Hundreds digit is 4: Pages 400-488. Here, the hundreds digit is 4, so every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. Let's see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 occurrences of the digit 4.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, we have 89 4's.\n\nNow, let's look at the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9 for each hundred. We need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nLet's break this down by hundreds:\n\n1. Hundreds digit 1: 100-199\n   - Tens digit cycles 0-9 for each hundred. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (140-149). So, that's 10 occurrences.\n\n2. Hundreds digit 2: 200-299\n   - Similarly, tens digit 4 occurs in 240-249, which is another 10 occurrences.\n\n3. Hundreds digit 3: 300-399\n   - Tens digit 4 occurs in 340-349, another 10 occurrences.\n\n4. Hundreds digit 4: 400-488\n   - Now, the tens digit here can be 0-8 because 488 is the last page. So, when the tens digit is 4, the numbers are 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nSo, total occurrences of 4 in the tens place across all three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40.\n\nWait, but wait a second. In the hundreds digit 4, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 400-488. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, correct. So, that's 10. So, total 40.\n\nNow, let's look at the units place in three-digit numbers. The units digit cycles 0-9 for each combination of hundreds and tens digits. So, for each occurrence of a hundreds and tens digit, the units digit will be 4 once. Let's calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place.\n\nAgain, breaking it down by hundreds:\n\n1. Hundreds digit 1: 100-199\n   - For each tens digit (0-9), the units digit 4 appears once. So, for each hundred, that's 10 occurrences (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194). So, 10.\n\n2. Hundreds digit 2: 200-299\n   - Similarly, 10 occurrences (204, 214, ..., 294).\n\n3. Hundreds digit 3: 300-399\n   - 10 occurrences (304, 314, ..., 394).\n\n4. Hundreds digit 4: 400-488\n   - Now, here, the tens digit can be 0-8, and for each tens digit, the units digit 4 appears once. So, how many tens digits are there? From 0 to 8, that's 9 tens digits. So, for each of these, the units digit 4 appears once. So, that's 9 occurrences (404, 414, ..., 484). Wait, but 484 is within 488, so yes, that's correct. So, 9.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 400 to 488, the units digit 4 occurs in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total units digit 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but wait, in the hundreds digit 4, the tens digit goes up to 8, so the units digit 4 appears 9 times, not 10. So, total units digit 4's: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 40\n- Units place: 39\n\nTotal 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. So, 168 4's in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, let's add the single-digit and two-digit 4's. Earlier, we had 20 4's in single and two-digit numbers. So, total 4's: 20 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Single-digit: 1, two-digit: 19, so 20. Three-digit: 168. So, total 188 4's.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with single-digit numbers: 1 to 9. The digit 8 appears once, on page 8. So, that's 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: 10 to 99.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 for numbers 80-89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: For each ten (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the units digit 8 appears once. There are 9 sets of ten in two-digit numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nAdding the single-digit 8, total 8's so far: 1 + 19 = 20.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers: 100 to 488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8? Wait, the book goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. So, no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers.\n\nBreaking it down by hundreds:\n\n1. Hundreds digit 1: 100-199\n   - Tens digit 8 occurs in 180-189, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 occurrences.\n\n2. Hundreds digit 2: 200-299\n   - Tens digit 8 occurs in 280-289, another 10 occurrences.\n\n3. Hundreds digit 3: 300-399\n   - Tens digit 8 occurs in 380-389, another 10 occurrences.\n\n4. Hundreds digit 4: 400-488\n   - Tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 here, so that's 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total tens digit 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nNow, units place: Let's count how many times 8 appears in the units place across all three-digit numbers.\n\nAgain, breaking it down by hundreds:\n\n1. Hundreds digit 1: 100-199\n   - For each tens digit (0-9), the units digit 8 appears once. So, 10 occurrences (108, 118, ..., 198).\n\n2. Hundreds digit 2: 200-299\n   - Similarly, 10 occurrences (208, 218, ..., 298).\n\n3. Hundreds digit 3: 300-399\n   - 10 occurrences (308, 318, ..., 398).\n\n4. Hundreds digit 4: 400-488\n   - For each tens digit (0-8), the units digit 8 appears once. So, tens digits 0-8 give 9 occurrences (408, 418, ..., 488). Wait, but 488 is included, so that's correct.\n\nSo, units digit 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, let me check that. From 400-488, the tens digits go up to 8, so units digit 8 appears 9 times, yes.\n\nSo, total units digit 8's: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, the total number of 8's is:\n\n- Tens place: 39\n- Units place: 39\n\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nAdding the single-digit and two-digit 8's, which were 20, total 8's: 20 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Single-digit: 1, two-digit: 19, so 20. Three-digit: 78. So, total 8's: 20 + 78 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's: 188. Total 8's: 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nFirst, let's recount the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n- Three-digit: hundreds (89) + tens (40) + units (39) = 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n- Three-digit: tens (39) + units (39) = 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the three-digit numbers. Did I count correctly?\n\nFor three-digit numbers, hundreds digit 4: 400-488.\n\nIn the hundreds place, that's 89 4's, correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for hundreds digits 1,2,3,4, each contributes 10 except for the last one, which contributes 9 because the tens digit only goes up to 8. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, for hundreds digits 1,2,3, each contributes 10, and for 4, it's 9. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, 89 + 39 + 39 = 167? Wait, no, 89 + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168. Wait, earlier I thought tens was 40, but in reality, when hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's correct. So, tens place in three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40.\n\nSimilarly, units place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\nTens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nUnits place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nAdding single and two-digit 8's: 20, total 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the answer would be different, but maybe 90 is correct.\n\nWait, let me check another way. Maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's digit by digit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the three-digit units place for 4's. Let me recount that.\n\nIn three-digit numbers, units digit 4:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 104,114,...,194: 10 numbers\n- Hundreds digit 2: 204,214,...,294: 10\n- Hundreds digit 3: 304,314,...,394: 10\n- Hundreds digit 4: 404,414,...,484: 9 (since 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488, so only up to 484, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total units digit 4's: 10+10+10+9=39. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 108,118,...,198:10\n- Hundreds digit 2: 208,218,...,298:10\n- Hundreds digit 3: 308,318,...,398:10\n- Hundreds digit 4: 408,418,...,488:9\n\nSo, total units digit 8's:10+10+10+9=39. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I included all the three-digit numbers correctly. For example, in the hundreds digit 4, from 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place for hundreds digit 4: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\nIn the units place for hundreds digit 4: 404,414,...,484, which is 9 numbers, so 9 4's.\n\nSo, 89+10+9=108? Wait, no, wait, that's not how I added earlier. Wait, no, earlier I had 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168. Wait, but 40 in the tens place includes the hundreds digits 1,2,3,4, each contributing 10, but for hundreds digit 4, it's 10, but in reality, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 10 for each hundreds digit, so 4 hundreds digits, but wait, hundreds digit 4 only goes up to 488, so in the tens place, it's 10. So, 40 in total.\n\nSimilarly, units place: 39.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place 39, units place 39, total 78.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 90 seems like a big difference. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor single-digit numbers (1-9):\n\n- 4 appears once.\n- 8 appears once.\n\nFor two-digit numbers (10-99):\n\n- Tens place: 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n- Units place: 4 appears 9 times (once in each ten except 40-49, where it's included in tens place), but actually, no, in two-digit numbers, the units digit 4 appears once per ten, so from 10-99, that's 9 tens (10-19, ..., 90-99), so 9 times. Similarly for 8, units digit appears 9 times.\n\nWait, no, actually, in two-digit numbers, the units digit 4 appears in 14,24,...,94, which is 9 times. Similarly, units digit 8 appears in 18,28,...,98, which is 9 times.\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n- 8's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n\nSo, single-digit:\n\n- 4:1, 8:1\n\nTotal so far:\n\n- 4:20, 8:20\n\nNow, three-digit numbers (100-488):\n\nLet's calculate for each digit position.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears in 400-488: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n\n- 8 never appears in hundreds place, as the book ends at 488.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For hundreds digits 1,2,3,4:\n\nEach hundreds digit contributes 10 times when the tens digit is 4, and 10 times when the tens digit is 8.\n\nBut wait, for hundreds digit 4, the tens digit can only go up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for tens digit 4 in hundreds digit 4: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For tens digit 8 in hundreds digit 4: 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, for tens digit 4 in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: each contributes 10, so 3*10=30\n- Hundreds digit 4: contributes 10\nTotal: 30 + 10 = 40\n\nSimilarly, for tens digit 8 in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: each contributes 10, so 3*10=30\n- Hundreds digit 4: contributes 9\nTotal: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nUnits place:\n\nFor units digit 4:\n\n- For hundreds digits 1,2,3: each contributes 10 (e.g., 104,114,...,194)\n- Hundreds digit 4: contributes 9 (404,414,...,484)\nTotal: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8:\n\n- For hundreds digits 1,2,3: each contributes 10\n- Hundreds digit 4: contributes 9 (408,418,...,488)\nTotal: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n- 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nAdding to single and two-digit counts:\n\n- 4's: 20 + 168 = 188\n- 8's: 20 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, so I think my initial calculation was correct. Therefore, the answer is 90.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think if I missed any pages. For example, in three-digit numbers, does 400 count as a page? Yes, it's included. Similarly, 488 is included. So, the counts seem accurate.\n\nAnother way to think about it: The number of 4's is higher because, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, every page has a 4, which is 89 pages, whereas 8's don't have any in the hundreds place. Additionally, in the tens and units places, 4's and 8's both appear, but the hundreds place gives a significant boost to 4's.\n\nSo, I think the difference is indeed 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Single-Digit Pages (1-9):**\n   - '4' appears once (page 4).\n   - '8' appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-Digit Pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - '4' appears in 40-49 (10 times).\n     - '8' appears in 80-89 (10 times).\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - '4' appears once in each ten (e.g., 14, 24, ..., 94) \u2192 9 times.\n     - '8' appears once in each ten (e.g., 18, 28, ..., 98) \u2192 9 times.\n   - Total for two-digit pages:\n     - '4': 10 + 9 = 19\n     - '8': 10 + 9 = 19\n\n3. **Three-Digit Pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - '4' appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n     - '8' never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - '4' appears in each hundred's 40-49:\n       - 100-199, 200-299, 300-399 \u2192 10 each.\n       - 400-488 \u2192 10 (440-449).\n       - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40.\n     - '8' appears in each hundred's 80-89:\n       - 100-199, 200-299, 300-399 \u2192 10 each.\n       - 400-488 \u2192 9 (480-488).\n       - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - '4' appears once per ten:\n       - 100-199, 200-299, 300-399 \u2192 10 each.\n       - 400-488 \u2192 9 (404, 414, ..., 484).\n       - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n     - '8' appears once per ten:\n       - 100-199, 200-299, 300-399 \u2192 10 each.\n       - 400-488 \u2192 9 (408, 418, ..., 488).\n       - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n   - Total for three-digit pages:\n     - '4': 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n     - '8': 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - '4': 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188\n   - '8': 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:**\nThe digit '4' is printed 90 times more than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Maybe I should handle each place one by one.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's and 8's in the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each set of ten numbers. For example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit appears once every ten numbers. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each complete set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for 8. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1, which is 48, plus any extra in the last partial set. Wait, the last set is 481-488, so the units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in this partial set, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49. So, in units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. Hmm, so so far, same count.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit goes from 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place for 80-89, which is also 10 times. Now, considering up to 488, how many complete hundreds do we have? Well, 488 is less than 500, so we have 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's five sets, but the last set is only up to 488, not 499. So, for the tens place, each complete hundred (like 0-99, 100-199, etc.) contributes 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place. So, for the first four hundreds (0-399), that's 4 sets, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40 for 4's and same for 8's. Now, the last set is 400-488. The tens digit here goes from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 in 480-488, which is 9 times (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place for 400-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total tens place 4's would be 4*10 + 10 = 50, and 8's would be 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. For each complete hundred, like 0-99, 100-199, etc., the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place. That's 4 sets, so 4*10=40 each. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. So, yes, 50 and 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, now, let's tally up all the occurrences.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for 400-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, that's correct.\n\nUnits place: Each digit appears 49 times each, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I calculated the units place, I considered 488 pages. So, the number of complete tens is 48, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, and then the last 8 pages (481-488) contribute one more 4 and one more 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8 in the units place. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. So, for the first four hundreds (0-399), that's 4*10=40 each. Then, in 400-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488), and 8 never appears. So, 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nAdding them up: 49+50+89=188 for 4's, and 49+49+0=98 for 8's. So, 188-98=90.\n\nHmm, but wait, I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a big difference. Let me try another approach to verify.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nUnits place:\nNumber of 4's: For each 10 numbers, there's one 4. So, total number of 4's in units place is floor(488/10) = 48, plus if the last number is >=4, which it is (488), so 48 + (488 mod 10 >=4 ? 1 :0). Wait, 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in units place: same logic, 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\nEach 100 numbers have 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, number of 4's in tens place: floor(488/100)*10 + extra in the last partial hundred.\n\nfloor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (440-449) and 8 for 9 numbers (480-488). So, total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50, and 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\nNumber of 4's: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nNumber of 8's: 0, since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Units Place Analysis:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48.\n   - Each set contributes one '4' and one '8' in the units place.\n   - Partial set (481-488) contributes one '4' (484) and one '8' (488).\n   - Total '4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total '8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place Analysis:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - Complete hundreds (0-399): 4 sets, each contributing 10 '4's and 10 '8's.\n   - Partial set (400-488): '4' appears 10 times (440-449), '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total '4's in tens place: 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total '8's in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place Analysis:**\n   - '4' appears in 400-488: 89 times.\n   - '8' never appears in the hundreds place.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - Total '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - Total '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each of those 48 sets, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Plus, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is one of them. That adds one more 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of 10 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, this happens every 100 numbers. So, in the range 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49). Then, in 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10 numbers. Similarly, in 201-300, it's 240-249, and in 301-400, it's 340-349. Now, 401-488 would have 440-449, but wait, 488 is less than 500, so 440-449 is within 401-488. So, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? Let's see: from 1-400, there are four blocks of 100, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but hold on. From 401-488, the tens digit 4 is only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, that's correct. So total tens place 4's are 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for the entire range of 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, that's 89 occurrences of the digit 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but hold on, 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? Let me check: 488 minus 400 is 88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process: units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8, so 488 is included, which adds another 8 in the units place. So, units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for an entire block of 10 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers. Let me check each block.\n\nIn 1-100: 80-89, that's 10 numbers.\nIn 101-200: 180-189, another 10.\nIn 201-300: 280-289, another 10.\nIn 301-400: 380-389, another 10.\nIn 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, the tens digit 8 appears in 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Each hundred block except the last one contributes 10, and the last one contributes 9 because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 49.\n\nSo, tens place 8's are 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's are 0.\n\nTherefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, units place 8's are 49, tens place 8's are 49, so total is 98. But let me check again.\n\nWait, when I counted the tens place 8's, I had 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, which is 49. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's are 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts.\n\nWait, for the 4's, in the hundreds place, I had 89 numbers from 400-488, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Then, in the tens place, I had 50, and units place 49, totaling 188. For 8's, units place 49, tens place 49, so 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. I had 50, which came from 40 in the first 400 pages and 10 in 440-449. That seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: For the 4's, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. In the tens place, every 100 numbers, the 40-49 block gives 10 4's in the tens place. So, from 1-400, that's 4 times 10, which is 40. Then, from 401-488, 440-449 is another 10, so 50 total. That's correct.\n\nFor the 8's, in the tens place, from 80-89, 180-189, etc., each gives 10, and 480-488 gives 9, so 4*10 +9=49. That's correct.\n\nUnits place for both digits: Each digit appears once every 10 numbers, so 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one, and the remaining 8 numbers contribute one more if the digit is \u22648. So, both 4 and 8 have 49 in units place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 89 +50 +49=188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, so the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the hundreds place, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me confirm:\n\nFor 4's in hundreds place: pages 400-488. 488-400=88, plus 1=89 pages. So, 89 4's.\n\nFor 4's in tens place: every 100 pages, 40-49, so 10 per 100. So, 400 pages would have 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the next 10 would be 440-449, which is another 10, so 50 total.\n\nUnits place: 488/10=48 full sets, each contributing one 4, and the last partial set (481-488) includes 484, so one more, total 49.\n\nSame for 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, so 98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** Each set of 10 numbers contributes one 4. There are 48 full sets (480 numbers) and one partial set (481-488), totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** Each 100 numbers contribute 10 4's in the tens place. From 1-400, there are 4 sets, contributing 40. From 401-488, 440-449 adds another 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 contribute 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** Similar to 4's, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** Each 100 numbers contribute 10 8's. From 1-400, there are 4 sets. From 401-488, 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's as pages go up to 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by considering each place one by one.\n\nFirst, let's think about the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and similarly, the digit 8 appears once. So, if I can figure out how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488 pages, I can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, every block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.) and similarly, 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place for each 100 numbers, and the same for 8.\n\nNow, the hundreds place is a bit different because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. For the digit 4 in the hundreds place, it appears from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. However, the digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book doesn't have 800 pages; it only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, from 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4. So, the digit 4 in the hundreds place appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, that's 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place, and 0 times for 8's in the hundreds place. So, that's a difference of +89 for 4's.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. Let's calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens digit across all page numbers.\n\nFor the tens place, each 100 numbers have 10 instances where the tens digit is 4 (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.) and similarly 10 instances where the tens digit is 8 (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 complete hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-499), but since the book ends at 488, the last hundred (400-488) isn't complete. So, let's see:\n\nFrom 100-399: that's 3 complete hundreds. Each of these contributes 10 times 4 in the tens place and 10 times 8 in the tens place. So, 3 * 10 = 30 for 4's and 30 for 8's.\n\nNow, from 400-488: The tens digit can be 0-8. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 instances. Similarly, the digit 8 in the tens place would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times in this last partial hundred.\n\nSo, adding up, for the tens place:\n\n4's: 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 40\n8's: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 40 times, and 8's appear 39 times, giving a difference of +1 for 4's.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place. Let's calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units digit.\n\nFor the units place, in every block of 10 numbers, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 complete blocks (since 48*10=480), and then 8 more pages (481-488). So, in each of the 48 complete blocks, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, 48 times each.\n\nThen, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So, in the units place:\n\n4's: 48 (from complete blocks) + 1 (from partial) = 49\n8's: 48 (from complete blocks) + 1 (from partial) = 49\n\nSo, in the units place, both 4's and 8's appear 49 times each, making the difference zero.\n\nNow, let me add up the counts from each place:\n\nHundreds place:\n4's: 89\n8's: 0\n\nTens place:\n4's: 40\n8's: 39\n\nUnits place:\n4's: 49\n8's: 49\n\nSo, total 4's = 89 + 40 + 49 = 178\nTotal 8's = 0 + 39 + 49 = 88\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me check my calculations again because 89 + 40 + 49 is 178, and 0 + 39 + 49 is 88, so the difference would be 178 - 88 = 90. But I'm not sure if I did the hundreds place correctly. Wait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so that's 89 times. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 100-399: 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the tens place, so 3*10=30 each. Then from 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because the book ends at 488. So, that's correct.\n\nIn the units place, 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So, total units digits: 49 each.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 49 (units) = 178\n8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 49 (units) = 88\n\nSo, the difference is 178 - 88 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe I missed something in the hundreds place. Let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem differently. Let's consider each digit place separately and calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor units digit, in every 10 numbers, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, total number of times 4 appears in units place is (488 // 10) + (1 if the last partial set includes 4 else 0). Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then, the last 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, tens place:\n\nIn the tens place, each 100 numbers have 10 times where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.) and 10 times where the tens digit is 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for each complete 100, 4 appears 10 times in tens place, 8 appears 10 times.\n\nNow, how many complete 100s are there in 488? Well, 4 complete hundreds: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-499. But since the book ends at 488, the last hundred isn't complete. So, from 100-399: 3 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 3*10=30 each.\n\nNow, from 400-488: The tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. The tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers because the book ends at 488. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in this range.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 30 + 10 = 40\nTotal 8's in tens place: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nAs before, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 pages. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book doesn't reach 800. So, 0 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the digits:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 178\n8's: 49 (units) + 39 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 88\n\nSo, the difference is 178 - 88 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe I was missing something, but after recalculating, it seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n1. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (pages 400-488).\n   - 8 appears 0 times.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears 40 times (30 from 100-399, 10 from 400-488).\n   - 8 appears 39 times (30 from 100-399, 9 from 400-488).\n\n3. **Units Place:**\n   - Both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each.\n\nAdding these up:\n- Total 4's = 89 + 40 + 49 = 178\n- Total 8's = 0 + 39 + 49 = 88\n\nDifference = 178 - 88 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by considering each place one by one.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in each digit place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, etc. Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times for the complete sets. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 is one of them, which is another 4. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, in each hundred, that's 10 occurrences. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100. Each set contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), up to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, in the tens place, 401-488 includes the tens digit 0 through 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Only in 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488. So, that's another 10 occurrences. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 more 4's in the tens place. So, total tens place 4's would be 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is another 10. So, total 50. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's would be units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place: As before, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing 1 8, so 48. Then, the extra 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nFrom 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the end)\n\nSo, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9 because 488 is included. So, 10*4=40 plus 9 is 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's would be units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, so in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 exactly 10 times. So, from 1-400, how many hundreds are there? 4 (1-400). So, 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the 4's and 8's.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. For 4's, from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 484 is there, which is another 4. So, 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers, 488 has a units digit of 8, so 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. Plus 40 in the first 400 pages, so total 50. Correct.\n\nTens place for 8's: 10 per hundred for 4 hundreds, so 40, plus 9 in 480-488, so 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 8's: None, since the book ends at 488. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, 8's:98, difference:90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the hundreds place for 4's would be 89, but let me confirm that. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 =89 numbers. Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nI think that's the answer. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers, '4' appears once. There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 '4's. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include one more '4' (484), totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** In each hundred, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). For 400 pages, this is 4*10=40. From 401-488, '4' appears in 440-449, adding 10, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, there are 89 numbers with '4' in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to '4', '8' appears 48 times in complete sets of 10, plus once in 488, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** In each hundred, '8' appears 10 times in the tens place. For 400 pages, this is 4*10=40. From 401-488, '8' appears in 480-488, adding 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No '8's as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 times more than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me start by counting the number of 4's first.\n\nAlright, so for single-digit page numbers (1-9), the only number with a 4 is page 4. So that's one 4. Now, moving on to two-digit numbers (10-99). Here, the 4 can appear in the tens place or the ones place. Let me think: in the tens place, the numbers would be 40-49. That's 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place, so that's 10 fours. In the ones place, the 4 would appear in numbers like 14, 24, 34, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, that's 9 numbers, right? Because from 10-99, each ten has a 4 in the ones place except for the 40-49 range, which we've already counted. Wait, no, actually, from 10-99, the ones digit cycles from 0-9 for each ten. So, in each ten, the ones digit 4 appears once. So, from 10-39, that's 3 tens, each contributing one 4 in the ones place, so 3 fours. Then from 50-99, that's 5 tens, each contributing one 4 in the ones place, so 5 fours. Wait, that would be 8 fours in the ones place, but I think I might be overcomplicating it. Maybe it's better to just count each occurrence. So, for two-digit numbers, the tens place gives 10 fours (40-49) and the ones place gives 9 fours (14,24,34,54,64,74,84,94). Wait, that's 9 because 44 is already counted in the tens place. So, total fours in two-digit numbers would be 10 + 9 = 19 fours. Wait, no, because in the ones place, from 10-99, excluding 40-49, how many 4's are there? Let's see: 14,24,34,54,64,74,84,94. That's 8 numbers, so 8 fours in the ones place. So total for two-digit numbers would be 10 (tens) + 8 (ones) = 18 fours. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier by including 44 twice, so it's actually 18 fours in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Let me break this down into hundreds, tens, and ones places. First, the hundreds place: the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit 4 only goes up to 488, not 499. So, for hundreds digit 4, the numbers are 400-488. Let's see how many 4's are in the hundreds place here. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89), each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 fours.\n\nNow, for the tens place in three-digit numbers: we need to consider each hundred separately. So, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. In each of these, the tens digit can be 0-9, so for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.), contributing 10 fours per hundred. So, for 100-199, 200-299, and 300-399, that's 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 3*10 = 30 fours. Now, for 400-488, the tens digit can go up to 8, so the 4 in the tens place would be in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, contributing 10 fours. So, total fours in the tens place for three-digit numbers would be 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 40 fours.\n\nNext, the ones place in three-digit numbers. Again, considering each hundred: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. In each hundred, the ones digit cycles through 0-9 for each ten, so for each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the ones place 10 times per hundred. So, for 100-199, 200-299, and 300-399, that's 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 fours, so 3*10 = 30 fours. Now, for 400-488, the ones digit 4 appears in numbers like 404,414,424,...,484. Let's see how many that is. From 400-488, the ones digit 4 occurs every 10 numbers, starting at 404. The last one would be 484. So, how many terms are there? Let's calculate: (484 - 404)/10 + 1 = (80)/10 +1 = 8 +1 = 9. So, 9 fours in the ones place for 400-488. So, total fours in the ones place for three-digit numbers would be 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39 fours.\n\nNow, adding up all the fours from each section: single-digit (1), two-digit (18), and three-digit (89 + 40 + 39). Wait, no, I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds, tens, and ones for three-digit numbers are separate, so let me correct that. The hundreds place in three-digit numbers contributed 89 fours, the tens place contributed 40 fours, and the ones place contributed 39 fours. So total fours in three-digit numbers would be 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 fours.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. For the tens place in three-digit numbers, I had 3 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 3*10=30, plus 10 from 400-488 (440-449), so 40 fours total. That seems correct. For the ones place, 3 hundreds contributing 10 each, so 30, plus 9 from 400-488, so 39. So, 30 + 39 = 69? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, I think I added them incorrectly. Let me recalculate: 3 hundreds contributing 10 each is 3*10=30, plus 9 from 400-488, so total ones place fours in three-digit numbers is 30 + 9 = 39. So, total fours in three-digit numbers would be hundreds (89) + tens (40) + ones (39) = 89 + 40 = 129, plus 39 is 168. So, 168 fours in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, adding up all fours: single-digit (1) + two-digit (18) + three-digit (168) = 1 + 18 = 19, plus 168 is 187. So, total number of 4's printed is 187.\n\nNow, I need to count the number of 8's printed. Let me do the same approach.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9), the only number with an 8 is page 8. So that's one 8.\n\nNext, two-digit numbers (10-99). The 8 can appear in the tens place or the ones place. In the tens place, the numbers are 80-89, which is 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place, so 10 eights. In the ones place, the 8 appears in numbers like 18,28,38,58,68,78,88,98. Wait, that's 8 numbers, but 88 is already counted in the tens place, so actually, in the ones place, it's 8 numbers. Wait, no, let me check: from 10-99, the ones digit 8 appears in 18,28,38,58,68,78,88,98. That's 8 numbers, but 88 is in both tens and ones place, so when counting the ones place, we should include 88 as well, but when we count the tens place, 88 is already counted. So, for the ones place, we have 8 numbers, but 88 is included in both counts. So, the total eights in two-digit numbers would be 10 (tens) + 8 (ones) = 18 eights. Wait, but 88 is counted twice here. So, the correct count would be 10 (tens) + 8 (ones) = 18, but since 88 is included in both, the total unique eights would still be 18 because each occurrence is counted separately. Wait, no, actually, each digit is counted separately, so 88 has two 8's, so in the tens place, it's counted once, and in the ones place, it's counted once. So, total eights in two-digit numbers would be 10 (tens) + 8 (ones) = 18, but 88 contributes two 8's, so actually, the total number of 8's is 18, but let me make sure. Let me list them:\n\nTens place: 80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89 \u2192 10 eights in the tens place.\n\nOnes place: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98 \u2192 9 eights in the ones place, but 88 is already counted in the tens place, so does that mean we have 9 or 8? Wait, no, when counting digits, each occurrence is counted, regardless of the position. So, 88 has two 8's, so in the tens place, we have 10 eights, and in the ones place, we have 9 eights, but 88's ones digit is an 8, so total eights in two-digit numbers would be 10 + 9 = 19, but that would count the two 8's in 88. Wait, but that's correct because each digit is counted separately. So, 88 contributes two 8's, so the total number of 8's in two-digit numbers is 19.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 18. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me recount.\n\nIn the tens place: 80-89, that's 10 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the tens place, so 10 eights.\n\nIn the ones place: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the ones place, so 9 eights.\n\nSo, total eights in two-digit numbers would be 10 + 9 = 19. But 88 is counted twice here, once in the tens and once in the ones. So, the total number of 8's is 19, which includes two 8's from 88. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers (100-488). Let's break this down into hundreds, tens, and ones places.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for hundreds digit 8, there are no numbers because the book only goes up to 488. So, no eights in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: Let's consider each hundred separately. So, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each ten. So, in each hundred, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, etc.), contributing 10 eights per hundred. So, for 100-199, 200-299, and 300-399, that's 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 eights, so 3*10 = 30 eights.\n\nNow, for 400-488, the tens digit can go up to 8, so the 8 in the tens place would be in 480-488. Wait, no, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place, contributing 9 eights.\n\nSo, total eights in the tens place for three-digit numbers would be 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39 eights.\n\nNow, the ones place in three-digit numbers. Again, considering each hundred: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nIn each hundred, the ones digit cycles through 0-9 for each ten, so for each hundred, the digit 8 appears in the ones place 10 times per hundred. So, for 100-199, 200-299, and 300-399, that's 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 eights, so 3*10 = 30 eights.\n\nFor 400-488, the ones digit 8 appears in numbers like 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Let me count how many that is. From 400-488, the ones digit 8 occurs every 10 numbers, starting at 408. The last one would be 488. So, how many terms are there? (488 - 408)/10 + 1 = (80)/10 +1 = 8 +1 = 9. So, 9 eights in the ones place for 400-488.\n\nTherefore, total eights in the ones place for three-digit numbers would be 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39 eights.\n\nNow, adding up all the eights from each section: single-digit (1), two-digit (19), three-digit (39 + 39). Wait, no, let me correct that. The three-digit eights are in the tens and ones places, so total eights in three-digit numbers would be tens (39) + ones (39) = 78 eights.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because earlier I had 39 eights in the tens place and 39 in the ones place, so total 78 eights in three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For the tens place in three-digit numbers, we had 30 from 100-399 and 9 from 400-488, totaling 39. For the ones place, 30 from 100-399 and 9 from 400-488, totaling 39. So, 39 + 39 = 78 eights in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, adding up all eights: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) = 1 + 19 = 20, plus 78 is 98. So, total number of 8's printed is 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought two-digit eights were 19, which included 88 twice, but I think that's correct because each digit is counted separately. So, 19 in two-digit, 78 in three-digit, plus 1 in single-digit, totaling 98 eights.\n\nNow, going back to the fours: I had 187 fours. Let me confirm that again. Single-digit:1, two-digit:18, three-digit:168. 1+18=19, plus 168=187. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 fours - 98 eights = 89 more fours.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nLet me recount the fours:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 4).\n\nTwo-digit: tens place (40-49:10 fours) + ones place (14,24,34,54,64,74,84,94:8 fours) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place: 400-488:89 fours.\n\nTens place: 100-199,200-299,300-399:3*10=30 fours. Plus 440-449:10 fours. Total 40.\n\nOnes place: 100-199,200-299,300-399:3*10=30 fours. Plus 404,414,...,484:9 fours. Total 39.\n\nSo, hundreds:89, tens:40, ones:39. 89+40=129+39=168.\n\nTotal fours:1+18+168=187.\n\nEights:\n\nSingle-digit:1 (page8).\n\nTwo-digit: tens place (80-89:10 eights) + ones place (18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98:9 eights) =10+9=19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nTens place:100-199,200-299,300-399:3*10=30 eights. Plus 480-488:9 eights. Total 39.\n\nOnes place:100-199,200-299,300-399:3*10=30 eights. Plus 408,418,...,488:9 eights. Total 39.\n\nTotal eights in three-digit:39+39=78.\n\nTotal eights:1+19+78=98.\n\nSo, 187 fours -98 eights=89.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 89, but I'm not sure if I made a mistake in the three-digit counts. Let me check the three-digit counts again.\n\nFor three-digit numbers, hundreds place:400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nTens place:100-199,200-299,300-399:each has 10 eights in the tens place, so 3*10=30. Plus 440-449:10 eights. So, 30+10=40. That's correct.\n\nOnes place:100-199,200-299,300-399:each has 10 fours in the ones place, so 3*10=30. Plus 404,414,...,484:9 fours. So, 30+9=39. Correct.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168 fours in three-digit numbers. Plus 1+18=19 from single and two-digit. Total 187 fours.\n\nFor eights:\n\nHundreds place: no eights.\n\nTens place:100-199,200-299,300-399:3*10=30 eights. Plus 480-488:9 eights. So, 30+9=39.\n\nOnes place:100-199,200-299,300-399:3*10=30 eights. Plus 408,418,...,488:9 eights. So, 30+9=39.\n\nTotal eights in three-digit:39+39=78.\n\nPlus single-digit (1) and two-digit (19):1+19=20. 78+20=98.\n\nSo, 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the three-digit tens place for eights. Let me check again.\n\nIn the tens place for three-digit numbers, for 100-199, the tens digit 8 is in 180-189, which is 10 numbers, so 10 eights. Similarly, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39. That's correct.\n\nIn the ones place, 100-199:108,118,...,198:10 numbers. Similarly for 200-299:208,...,298:10. 300-399:308,...,398:10. 400-488:408,...,488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39. Correct.\n\nSo, 39+39=78 in three-digit numbers. Plus 1+19=20. 78+20=98.\n\nSo, 187 fours -98 eights=89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I remember sometimes when counting digits, especially in higher ranges, it's easy to miscount. Let me try a different approach for verification.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: In every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. From 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers, so 488 /10 = 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 fours. But wait, 488 is the last number, which is 48*10 +8, so the units digit 4 appears 48 times. But wait, in the hundreds and tens places, we have more. Wait, no, that's only for the units place.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to use the standard digit counting method.\n\nThe standard approach is to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place from 1 to 488:\n\nEach block of 10 numbers contributes one 4. So, 488 /10 = 48 full blocks, contributing 48 fours. But since 488 ends with 8, the last block is 480-488, which doesn't include a units digit 4. So, total units place fours:48.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's in tens place:\n\nEach block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40 fours. But wait, we're only going up to 488, so in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours:40 (from 1-400) +10=50.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 40 fours in the tens place for three-digit numbers. Hmm, perhaps this approach is giving a different count. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the counts.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Using the standard method:\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of 4's = (488 +1) // 10 *1 + extra if needed.\n\nWait, the formula is (n + 1) // 10 *1 for each digit. Wait, perhaps it's better to use the standard digit counting formula.\n\nThe formula to count the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n is as follows:\n\nFor each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times d appears.\n\nLet me apply this to 4's.\n\nNumber of 4's in units place from 1 to 488:\n\n- Divide 488 by 10: 48.8. The integer part is 48, so 48 times.\n\nNumber of 4's in tens place:\n\n- Divide 488 by 100:4.88. The integer part is 4, so 4*10=40.\n\nBut then, look at the remainder:88. The tens digit is 8, which is greater than 4, so we add 10 - (88 - (4*10 +10))? Wait, maybe I'm complicating it.\n\nAlternatively, the formula is:\n\nFor each position, the count is higher digit * 10^power + something.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use the standard method.\n\nLet me try to count the number of 4's in each position.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of 4's = (488 // 10) *1 + min(488 %10,4). Wait, no, the formula is:\n\nFor units place:\n\ncount = (n // 10) *1 + (1 if (n %10) >=4 else 0).\n\nSo, for n=488:\n\ncount_units_4 = (488 //10)*1 + (1 if (488%10)>=4 else 0).\n\n488//10=48, 488%10=8, which is >=4, so count_units_4=48+1=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, perhaps I was wrong earlier.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\ncount_tens_4 = (488 //100)*10 + (if (488//10)%10 >=4, then (488%100)+1 else 0).\n\nWait, 488//100=4, so 4*10=40.\n\nNow, (488//10)%10=8, which is greater than 4, so we add (488%100)+1=88+1=89? Wait, that can't be right because 400-488 only has 89 numbers, but the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so adding 10.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\ncount_tens_4 = (higher_digits) *10 + (if (current_digit) >4, then 10 else (current_digit -4 +1)).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to count manually.\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place.\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, for each hundred, 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. So, from 1-399, that's 4 hundreds (100-199,200-299,300-399), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place: 4*10=40.\n\nNow, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours:40+10=50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 40. Hmm, now I'm confused.\n\nWait, let's use the standard formula:\n\nFor the tens place:\n\ncount = (n // 100) *10 + min(max(n %100 -4*10 +1,0),10).\n\nWait, n=488.\n\nn//100=4, so 4*10=40.\n\nn%100=88.\n\nNow, the tens digit is 8 (from 88), which is greater than 4, so we add min(88 -40 +1,10)=49, but that can't be right because we can't have more than 10 in the tens place.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\ncount = (higher part) *10 + (if current digit >4, then 10 else (current digit -4 +1)).\n\nIn this case, higher part is 4 (from 488//100=4), so 4*10=40.\n\nCurrent digit is 8 (from 488//10=48, so 48//10=4, but wait, no, 488//10=48, so the tens digit is 48%10=8.\n\nSince 8 >4, we add 10.\n\nSo, total tens place fours:40+10=50.\n\nSo, according to this, tens place fours are 50.\n\nSimilarly, for the hundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-488, the hundreds digit is 4 only in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, hundreds place fours:89.\n\nSo, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) =49+50=99+89=188.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 187. So, there's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's recount using the standard formula.\n\nUnits place:49 fours.\n\nTens place:50 fours.\n\nHundreds place:89 fours.\n\nTotal:49+50+89=188.\n\nBut earlier, using the position-wise counting, I had 187. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier method. Let me check.\n\nEarlier, I had:\n\nSingle-digit:1.\n\nTwo-digit:18.\n\nThree-digit:168.\n\nTotal:1+18+168=187.\n\nBut using the standard formula, it's 188. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nLet me check the units place.\n\nUsing the standard formula, units place fours are 49. But earlier, I had 48 in units place. Let me see:\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place.\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488//10=48 full decades, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours. But since 488 ends with 8, the last number is 488, so the units digit 4 appears in 480,481,...,488? No, 480-489 would be the next decade, but we only go up to 488. So, in the units place, the 4 appears in 484, which is within 480-488. So, that's one more, making it 49.\n\nSo, units place fours:49.\n\nTens place fours:50.\n\nHundreds place fours:89.\n\nTotal:49+50+89=188.\n\nSo, earlier, I must have undercounted the units place by one. So, the correct total fours are 188.\n\nSimilarly, let's apply the standard formula to the eights.\n\nNumber of eights in units place:\n\nUsing the formula, units place eights: (488//10)*1 + (1 if (488%10)>=8 else 0).\n\n488//10=48, 488%10=8, which is >=8, so units place eights:48+1=49.\n\nTens place eights:\n\n(488//100)*10 + (if (488//10)%10 >=8, then (488%100)+1 else 0).\n\n488//100=4, so 4*10=40.\n\n488//10=48, so (48//10)=4, which is the tens digit. Wait, no, 488//10=48, so the tens digit is 48%10=8.\n\nSince 8 >=8, we add (488%100)+1=88+1=89. Wait, that can't be right because we can't have 89 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\ncount = (higher part) *10 + (if current digit >8, then 10 else (current digit -8 +1)).\n\nWait, but 8 is the digit we're counting, so perhaps:\n\ncount = (higher part) *10 + min(max(n %100 -8*10 +1,0),10).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as:\n\nFor the tens place, the number of eights is:\n\n- For each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears in 10 numbers (e.g., 180-189, etc.), so for each hundred, 10 eights.\n\nFrom 1"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit position separately\u2014units, tens, hundreds. Let me start with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra numbers. Each complete set contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 sets would give 48 4's and 48 8's. Now, the extra 8 numbers are from 481 to 488. Let's check the units digits here: 481 has 1, 482 has 2, 483 has 3, 484 has 4, 485 has 5, 486 has 6, 487 has 7, and 488 has 8. So, in the units place of these extra 8 numbers, there's one 4 and one 8. Therefore, total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. Hmm, so the count is the same here. Now, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers, right? Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? From 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? Well, 488 is less than 500, so we have four complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, actually, from 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, each hundred contributes 10 times the digit in the tens place. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, in 101-200, the tens digit 4 appears in 140-149, another 10 times. Same for 201-300 (240-249) and 301-400 (340-349). So, that's 4 times 10, which is 40. Now, what about 401-488? The tens digit here cycles from 0 to 8 in the tens place. So, the tens digit 4 would appear in 440-449, which is 10 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's would be 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but let me check: 1-100: 40-49 (10), 101-200:140-149 (10), 201-300:240-249 (10), 301-400:340-349 (10), 401-488:440-449 (10). So, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. Now, for the digit 8 in the tens place. Let's do the same. From 1-100: 80-89 (10), 101-200:180-189 (10), 201-300:280-289 (10), 301-400:380-389 (10). Then, in 401-488: the tens digit 8 would be in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. So, so far, the difference in the tens place is 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 than 8. Now, let's move to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 times. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit goes up to 4 in this book, since it's 488 pages. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Therefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's. Now, let me sum up the differences from each place. Units place: 49 - 49 = 0. Tens place: 50 - 49 = 1. Hundreds place: 89 - 0 = 89. So, total difference is 0 + 1 + 89 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recalculate the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, yes, 89 is correct. For the tens place, I had 50 for 4 and 49 for 8, so that's a difference of 1. Units place, both 49, so no difference. So, total is 89 + 1 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. For 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 times, right? So, adding that to the previous 40, making 50. For 8 in the tens place, in 401-488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 50 vs 49, difference of 1. Units place: both 49. Hundreds place: 89 vs 0. So, 89 +1 = 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full sets, contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488) add 1 more 4 and 1 more 8.\n   - Total 4's: 49, 8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - From 1-400: 4 appears 40 times (10 in each hundred), 8 appears 40 times.\n   - From 401-488: 4 appears 10 times (440-449), 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 50, 8's: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSumming up:\n- Units: 0 difference\n- Tens: 1 more 4\n- Hundreds: 89 more 4's\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me start by counting the number of 4's.\n\nFirst, let's count the single-digit page numbers. These are from 1 to 9. The digit 4 appears once here, which is on page 4. The digit 8 also appears once here, on page 8. So, in single-digit pages, both 4 and 8 appear once each.\n\nNext, I'll move on to the two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. I think I should consider each digit place separately: the tens place and the ones place.\n\nStarting with the tens place for two-digit numbers: The tens digit can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. For each tens digit, the ones digit ranges from 0 to 9. So, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, when the tens digit is 4, the numbers are 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place, the numbers are 80 to 89, which is also 10 times. So, in the tens place of two-digit numbers, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times.\n\nNow, for the ones place in two-digit numbers: For each set of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the ones digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set, the digit 4 appears once (e.g., 14, 24, etc.), and the digit 8 appears once (e.g., 18, 28, etc.). Since there are 9 sets of ten in two-digit numbers (10-99), the digit 4 appears 9 times in the ones place, and the same for 8. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of 10. So, for each digit place, the digit appears 9 times in the ones place. Wait, but actually, in each set of ten, the ones digit cycles through 0-9, so for each digit (including 4 and 8), it appears once per set. So, for 9 sets, that's 9 times for 4 and 9 times for 8 in the ones place.\n\nWait, but let me check: For two-digit numbers, from 10 to 99, how many times does 4 appear in the ones place? It's 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 times. Similarly, 8 appears in 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's also 9 times. So, in the ones place for two-digit numbers, 4 and 8 each appear 9 times.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (ones place) = 19 times. Similarly, for 8's, it's 10 (tens place) + 9 (ones place) = 19 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This part might be a bit more complicated because the range doesn't go up to 999, only to 488. So, I'll have to consider the hundreds, tens, and ones places, but not all the way to 999.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the three-digit numbers into hundreds, tens, and ones.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book only goes up to 488. So, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nI need to count how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Well, in the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, the tens place in three-digit numbers: For each hundred, the tens digit can be 0-9, and the ones digit can be 0-9. But since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit 4's tens digit only goes up to 8 (i.e., 400-488). So, I need to be careful with the 400-488 range.\n\nLet me first consider the hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 separately.\n\nFor hundreds digit 1 (100-199): The tens digit can be 0-9, and for each tens digit, the ones digit can be 0-9. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? For each hundreds group, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so in 100-199, the tens digit 4 appears in 140-149, which is 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in 180-189, which is 10 times.\n\nSame logic applies to hundreds digits 2 and 3. So, in 200-299, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (240-249), and 8 appears 10 times (280-289). Similarly, in 300-399, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (340-349), and 8 appears 10 times (380-389).\n\nNow, for the hundreds digit 4 (400-488): The tens digit can be 0-8 because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place for 400-488. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so the tens digit is 8 for all these, but how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? It's 9 times, from 480 to 488 inclusive. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: For the hundreds digit 4, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 4, the numbers are 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. When the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, for the tens place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each has 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place.\n- For hundreds digit 4: 10 times for 4 and 9 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo, total for 4 in the tens place: 3 hundreds * 10 = 30, plus 10 for the 400s, totaling 40 times.\nTotal for 8 in the tens place: 3 hundreds * 10 = 30, plus 9 for the 400s, totaling 39 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the ones place in three-digit numbers.\n\nFor each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the ones digit cycles from 0-9 for each tens digit.\n\nStarting with hundreds digit 1 (100-199):\n\n- For each tens digit (0-9), the ones digit 4 appears once per ten numbers. So, for each of the 10 tens digits, the ones digit 4 appears once, so total 10 times for 4.\n- Similarly, the ones digit 8 appears once per ten numbers, so 10 times for 8.\n\nSame logic applies to hundreds digits 2 and 3. So, each of these hundreds groups contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the ones place.\n\nNow, for hundreds digit 4 (400-488):\n\nHere, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, and for each tens digit, the ones digit cycles 0-9, but we have to consider that the last group (tens digit 8) only goes up to 488, so the ones digit goes from 0 to 8.\n\nSo, for each tens digit from 0 to 7, the ones digit 4 appears once, and the ones digit 8 appears once.\n\nFor the tens digit 8 (480-488), the ones digit goes from 0 to 8, so the ones digit 4 appears once (484), and the ones digit 8 appears once (488).\n\nWait, but let me think again. For each tens digit in 400-488, the ones digit goes from 0 to 9 except when the tens digit is 8, where it only goes up to 8.\n\nSo, for tens digits 0-7: Each has 10 numbers, so ones digit 4 appears once per tens digit, and ones digit 8 appears once per tens digit. So, 8 tens digits (0-7) * 1 = 8 times for 4 and 8 times for 8.\n\nFor tens digit 8: The ones digits go from 0 to 8, so 9 numbers. So, ones digit 4 appears once (484) and ones digit 8 appears once (488). So, that's 1 time each.\n\nTherefore, total for 4 in the ones place for hundreds digit 4: 8 (from tens 0-7) + 1 (from tens 8) = 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, total for 8 in the ones place for hundreds digit 4: 8 (from tens 0-7) + 1 (from tens 8) = 9 times.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me check with an example. For 400-409: ones digit 4 appears once (404), and 8 appears once (408). Similarly, for 410-419: 414 and 418, etc. So, for each tens digit from 0-7, the ones digit 4 and 8 each appear once. That's 8 times each. Then, for 480-488, the ones digits go up to 8, so 484 and 488. So, that's one more for each. So, total 9 times for 4 and 9 times for 8 in the ones place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, putting it all together for the ones place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8. So, 3 * 10 = 30 for 4 and 30 for 8.\n- Hundreds digit 4: 9 times for 4 and 9 times for 8.\n- So, total for ones place: 30 + 9 = 39 times for 4, and 30 + 9 = 39 times for 8.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, because for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the ones place. So, 3 * 10 = 30 for 4 and 30 for 8. Then, for hundreds digit 4, it's 9 times for 4 and 9 times for 8. So, total ones place: 30 + 9 = 39 for 4, and 30 + 9 = 39 for 8.\n\nWait, but that would mean that in the ones place, 4 and 8 each appear 39 times in three-digit numbers. Hmm, but let me think again. For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, each has 100 numbers, so 10 times per digit in the ones place. So, 3 * 10 = 30 for 4 and 30 for 8. Then, for hundreds digit 4, which is 89 numbers (400-488), how many times does 4 appear in the ones place? Let's see: For each tens digit from 0 to 8, the ones digit 4 appears once, except maybe the last tens digit. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 9 times. But let me count differently: From 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the ones place? They are 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times. Similarly, 8 in the ones place: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 times. So, yes, 9 times each. So, total for ones place in three-digit numbers: 30 + 9 = 39 for 4, and 30 + 9 = 39 for 8.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check with an example. For hundreds digit 1, 100-199: The ones digit 4 appears in 104, 114, ..., 194, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times. So, that's correct. Similarly for 200-299 and 300-399. Then, for 400-488, as we saw, 9 times each. So, total 39 times each.\n\nNow, let me sum up all the occurrences of 4 and 8 in three-digit numbers.\n\nIn the hundreds place: 89 times for 4, 0 times for 8.\n\nIn the tens place: 40 times for 4, 39 times for 8.\n\nIn the ones place: 39 times for 4, 39 times for 8.\n\nSo, total for 4 in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 times.\n\nTotal for 8 in three-digit numbers: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 times.\n\nWait, let me add that again. 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (ones) = 168 for 4. For 8: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (ones) = 78.\n\nNow, let's go back and sum up all occurrences in single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nFirst, single-digit:\n\n- 4: 1 time\n- 8: 1 time\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- 4: 19 times\n- 8: 19 times\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- 4: 168 times\n- 8: 78 times\n\nSo, total for 4: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188 times.\n\nTotal for 8: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98 times.\n\nWait, let me check that addition again.\n\nFor 4:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal: 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 168 = 188.\n\nFor 8:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal: 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's printed is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the number of 4's printed more than 8's is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems a bit high. Let me go through each part again.\n\nStarting with single-digit:\n\n- 4: 1\n- 8: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place: 10 for 4, 10 for 8\n- Ones place: 9 for 4, 9 for 8\nTotal: 19 for 4, 19 for 8\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 for 4, 0 for 8\n- Tens place: 40 for 4, 39 for 8\n- Ones place: 39 for 4, 39 for 8\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 for 4; 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 for 8\n\nAdding up:\n\n- 4: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n- 8: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488. \n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - 8 appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Ones place:** 4 appears 9 times (14, 24, ..., 94), 8 appears 9 times (18, 28, ..., 98).\n   - Total for two-digit pages: 19 times each.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 does not appear.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n   - **Ones place:** 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n   - Total for three-digit pages: 168 times for 4, 78 times for 8.\n\n**Total counts:**\n- 4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n- 8's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds places. Let me start by considering each position one by one.\n\nFirst, for the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once and the digit 8 appears once. How many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete blocks and then an incomplete block of 8 numbers. In each complete block, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for the units place, the count of 4's is 48 times plus any additional in the incomplete block. The incomplete block is from 481 to 488, so the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place of the incomplete block, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, the total count for units place 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both digits appear 49 times. Hmm, so no difference there yet.\n\nNext, the tens place. In the tens place, digits cycle every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place within each 100-number block. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), ..., up to 9 (90-99). So, in each 100-number block, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and similarly, 8 appears 10 times. Now, how many complete 100-number blocks are in 488? Let's see: 400 pages would be four complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each of the four complete blocks, the tens digit 4 and 8 each appear 10 times. That's 4 * 10 = 40 times for each digit. Now, in the incomplete block from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). Wait, actually, let's correct that. The tens digit in 401-488: 401-410 has tens digit 0, 411-420 has 1, 421-430 has 2, 431-440 has 3, 441-450 has 4, 451-460 has 5, 461-470 has 6, 471-480 has 7, and 481-488 has 8. So, in the incomplete block, the tens digit 4 appears from 441-450, which is 10 times, and the tens digit 8 appears from 481-488, which is 8 times. Wait, no, from 481-488, the tens digit is 8, but there are only 8 numbers there (481-488). So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times (in 441-450), and the digit 8 appears 8 times (in 481-488). Therefore, the total for the tens place is: 4's: 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the incomplete block, so 40 + 10 = 50. 8's: 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 8 in the incomplete block, so 40 + 8 = 48. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 48 times. That means there's a difference of 2 more 4's than 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only non-zero from page 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, which doesn't count. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299 is 2; 300-399 is 3; and 400-488 is 4. So, the hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488. Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8, on the other hand, never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. Therefore, 8's in the hundreds place is 0. So, in the hundreds place, 4's are 89 and 8's are 0, so that's 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let's add up the counts from each place:\n\n- Units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49\n- Tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 48\n- Hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, each contributing 1 to 4's and 1 to 8's. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So, 4's: 48 + 1 = 49; 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1-488, each 100-number block contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. There are 4 full 100s (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). So, 4 * 10 = 40 for each digit. Now, the incomplete block is 401-488. Let's see the tens digits:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: 1\n- 421-430: 2\n- 431-440: 3\n- 441-450: 4 (10 times)\n- 451-460: 5\n- 461-470: 6\n- 471-480: 7\n- 481-488: 8 (8 times)\n\nSo, 4's in tens place: 10\n8's in tens place: 8\n\nTherefore, total tens place:\n\n4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nThat's correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times. So, 4's: 89, 8's: 0\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nHmm, but wait, I'm a bit confused because the hundreds place is contributing a lot. Let me check if I counted correctly.\n\nWait, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's there. From 100-199, hundreds digit is 1; 200-299 is 2; 300-399 is 3; 400-488 is 4. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is indeed 89 times. So, 89 4's in hundreds place, correct.\n\nSo, 188 total 4's and 97 total 8's. So, 188 - 97 = 91. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in different positions, it's easy to make a mistake.

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit position separately\u2014units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by considering each position one by one.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in each position.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, from 1-10: 4 appears once (at page 4). From 11-20: 4 appears once (at page 14), and so on. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 pages. Each block contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digit cycles from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more at page 484. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds and then an extra 88 pages. Each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40. Now, in the extra 88 pages (from 400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 440-449, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: Units (49) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me compute that: 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through each digit position similarly.\n\nUnits place: Just like with 4's, in each block of 10, the digit 8 appears once. So, from 1-488, there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra pages. Each block contributes one 8, so 48 times. In the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once at page 488. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For the tens digit, in each block of 100, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89). So, 4 complete hundreds contribute 4 x 10 = 40 8's. Now, in the extra 88 pages (400-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? From 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 pages: 480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, is that right? Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, that's 9 8's in the tens place. Therefore, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the tens place count. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in the range 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 8's in the tens place. So, 40 (from the first 400) + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was counting 4's in the tens place, I had 50. So, perhaps the 8's in the tens place are 49, and 4's in the tens place are 50. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me confirm the 8's in the tens place again. From 0-488, the tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, each of the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 8's, and the last range contributes 9 8's. So, 4 x 10 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 188, and 8's are 98, so the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But I feel like that might not be correct because I might have made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me go through each digit position again for both 4's and 8's to make sure.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place: Each 10 pages, one 4. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have page 484, which is one more 4. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nTens place: Each 100 pages, 10 times 4 in the tens place. 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's, so 40. Then, in the last 88 pages (400-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nUnits place: Each 10 pages, one 8. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have page 488, which is one more 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: Each 100 pages, 10 times 8 in the tens place. 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 8's, so 40. Then, in the last 88 pages (400-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488). So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 4's would have more, but I think I accounted for that correctly. Let me just check if I counted the hundreds place correctly. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 4's. That seems right.\n\nAnother way to check: For 4's, the hundreds place contributes 89, which is a significant number, so that's a big chunk. The tens and units contribute the rest. For 8's, since the hundreds digit never reaches 8, all 8's are in the tens and units places, which we've counted as 49 each, totaling 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. When I consider the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. That's 9 numbers, right? So, 9 8's in the tens place. So, 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the total number of times 8 appears in each position:\n\nUnits: 48 full decades (1-480) contribute 48 8's, and then in 481-488, the units digit 8 appears once at 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens: Each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) contribute 4 x 10 = 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds: 0.\n\nSo, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's:\n\nUnits: 48 full decades, each with one 4, plus 484, so 49.\n\nTens: 4 full hundreds, each with 10 4's (40), plus 440-449, which is 10 more, so 50.\n\nHundreds: 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** In every block of 10 pages, 4 appears once. There are 48 full blocks (480 pages), contributing 48 fours. The remaining 8 pages (481-488) include one more 4 (at 484), totaling 49.\n   - **Tens place:** In every block of 100 pages, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. There are 4 full blocks (400 pages), contributing 40 fours. The remaining 88 pages (400-488) include 10 fours (440-449), totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, there are 89 pages with 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears once every 10 pages, totaling 48 in 480 pages. The last 8 pages include one more 8 (at 488), totaling 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears 10 times every 100 pages. In 400 pages, that's 40. The remaining 88 pages include 9 tens places (480-488), totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should tackle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start with the units place because that seems simpler.\n\nFor the units place, I'm looking at how often 4 and 8 appear in the units digit of all page numbers. From 1 to 488, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in the units place, except maybe the last set if 488 isn't a multiple of 10. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10 pages and then 8 extra pages (481-488). In each group of 10, the digits 0-9 each appear once in the units place. So, for each digit, the count in the units place would be 48 times for each digit, plus any extra in the last partial group. For 4, in the units place, each group contributes one 4, so 48 times. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once more (484). So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, 8's in units place: 48 times, plus in the last 8 pages, 8 appears once (488). So 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times? That seems the same, so the difference here is zero. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, no, because 488 is included, so 488 is the last page, so in the last partial group, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So yes, both 4 and 8 have 49 in the units place. So units place contributes 0 difference.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, etc., up to 9 for 90-99. So for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. Now, since the book goes up to 488, that's four hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and then 400-488. Wait, actually, 488 is 4 hundreds plus 88 pages. So let me calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nFirst, for the first hundred (1-99), the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times, and 8 in 80-89, also 10 times. So in the first hundred, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNext, for the second hundred (100-199), the tens digit cycles again. So 4 appears in 140-149, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 180-189, also 10 times. Same for the third hundred (200-299): 4 in 240-249, 10 times, and 8 in 280-289, 10 times.\n\nNow, the fourth hundred is 300-399. Similarly, 4 in 340-349, 10 times, and 8 in 380-389, 10 times. So up to 399, each of 4 and 8 has appeared 40 times in the tens place (10 times per hundred for 4 hundreds).\n\nNow, the last part is 400-488. The tens digit here is 0 for 400-409, 1 for 410-419, and so on up to 8 for 480-488. So in this range, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see: from 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So 4 appears when the tens digit is 4, which is 440-449. That's 10 pages, so 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears when the tens digit is 8, which is 480-488. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 pages, right? Because 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers. So in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in this last partial hundred. So total in the tens place: 4's are 10 times, and 8's are 9 times. So adding to the previous total, 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. So the difference in the tens place is 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. For 8, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So yes, 9 times. So 10 vs 9, so 4's have one more in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. How about 8? Does 8 ever appear in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So the count for 8's in the hundreds place is 0. So the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me summarize the counts:\n\n- Units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49 \u2192 difference 0\n- Tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49 \u2192 difference +1\n- Hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0 \u2192 difference +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, so that would mean there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but let me check each part again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in units place, so 4 times 10 is 40, but since we have 488 pages, which is 4 full hundreds (each contributing 10) and then 88 pages. Wait, no, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens and 8 extra. So for units place, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times, plus in the last 8 pages, digits 1-8 appear once each. So 4 appears once more (484), and 8 appears once more (488). So 4's in units: 48 + 1 = 49, 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in tens place. So 4 hundreds would give 40 times for each digit. Then, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So 4's: 40 +10=50, 8's:40+9=49. Difference +1. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. So difference +89. Correct.\n\nAdding up: 0 +1 +89=90. So 90 more 4's than 8's. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me think again. In the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times. But does 400 count as a page? Yes, page 400 is included, so 400-488 is 89 pages. So that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99 +89=188.\n\nTotal number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nSo 188 - 98 = 90. So yes, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any pages. Each page is only counted once, and each digit is considered in its place. So units, tens, hundreds are separate, so adding them up should be correct.\n\nI think that's the right answer. So the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place (from 1 to 480).\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Difference: 49 - 49 = 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred, totaling 40 times for each digit up to 399.\n   - Pages 400-488 add 10 more 4's (440-449) and 9 more 8's (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - Difference: 50 - 49 = 1.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n   - Difference: 89 - 0 = 89.\n\n**Total Difference:**\n- Units: 0\n- Tens: +1\n- Hundreds: +89\n- **Total:** 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nThus, 4's are printed 90 more times than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by counting the number of 4's and 8's in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits go from 1 to 0. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. But wait, since we start at 1, the first set is 1-10, so the units digits are 1-0, which includes 0. So, in each set of 10, each digit from 0-9 appears once. Therefore, for the units place, the number of 4's and 8's would be the same in each set of 10. But let's check how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488 pages.\n\nWait, actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of 10, and then 8 extra pages (481-488). So, in each complete set of 10, the units digit cycles through 0-9 once. So, in each set, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Therefore, for 48 complete sets, that's 48 times each, so 48 4's and 48 8's in the units place. Now, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) will have units digits from 1 to 8. So, in the units place of these, we have a 4 (484) and an 8 (488). So, that's one more 4 and one more 8 in the units place. So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 8's. Wait, that seems equal, so maybe the units place doesn't contribute to the difference. Hmm, but let me check that again.\n\nWait, the remaining pages after 480 are 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, yes, 484 has a 4 in the units place, and 488 has an 8. So, that's one more 4 and one more 8 in the units place. So, total units place: 48 (from complete sets) +1 = 49 4's and 48 +1=49 8's. So, same number, so no difference from units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every 10 pages. So, for example, from 1-9, the tens digit is 0, but since we're starting at 1, maybe I should think differently. Wait, actually, for the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in a block of 100. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each (from 01-09, 10-19, etc.). Wait, but in reality, page numbers start at 1, so maybe the first set is 1-9, which don't have a tens digit, but in terms of two-digit numbers, from 10-99, the tens digit is from 1-9. Hmm, perhaps I should approach this by considering each hundred separately.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to calculate how many times each digit appears in each place (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers up to 488.\n\nLet me start with the units place again, but perhaps more carefully.\n\nUnits place:\n\nTotal pages: 488.\n\nEach digit from 0-9 appears equally in the units place, except possibly the last partial set.\n\nNumber of complete sets of 10: floor(488 / 10) = 48 sets, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 4's and 48 8's.\n\nRemaining pages: 488 - (48 * 10) = 488 - 480 = 8 pages: 481-488.\n\nIn these, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 48 +1 = 49 4's, and 48 +1 = 49 8's.\n\nSo, units place: 49 each, so no difference.\n\nTens place:\n\nSimilarly, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. But since we have 488 pages, which is less than 500, we have four hundreds: 0 (1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). Wait, no, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, let's break it down.\n\nFrom 1-99: Tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each tens digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place, except 0, which appears 9 times (since 1-9 don't have a tens digit, but in page numbers, they are single-digit, so perhaps the tens digit is 0? Wait, actually, in page numbers, 1-9 are single-digit, so their tens digit is 0, but perhaps we don't count leading zeros. Hmm, this is a point of confusion. Wait, in page numbers, 1 is just '1', not '01'. So, the tens digit for 1-9 is non-existent, or effectively 0, but since we're considering two-digit numbers, maybe it's better to think of 1-9 as having a tens digit of 0. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think of all page numbers as three-digit numbers, padding with leading zeros, but I don't think that's standard. So, perhaps for 1-9, the tens digit doesn't exist, so we don't count it. Therefore, in the tens place, from 10-99, each digit from 1-9 appears 10 times. So, for 10-99, the tens digit cycles through 1-9, each appearing 10 times. So, in the tens place, from 10-99, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\nThen, from 100-199: Each number is 1XY, where X is the tens digit. So, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 for each hundred. So, in 100-199, each tens digit from 0-9 appears 10 times. So, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, from 200-299: same as above, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place.\n\nFrom 300-399: same, 10 times each.\n\nFrom 400-488: Now, this is a partial hundred. The tens digit here goes from 0-8, since 488 is the last page. So, in 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does each tens digit appear?\n\nFrom 400-488: The tens digits go from 0 to 8. Each tens digit from 0-7 appears 10 times (e.g., 400-409: tens digit 0, 410-419: tens digit 1, etc.), but for the last tens digit, 8, it appears only 9 times (480-488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, in the tens place for 400-488:\n\n- Tens digits 0-7: each appears 10 times.\n- Tens digit 8: appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, for 400-488:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times (when the tens digit is 4, from 440-449).\n- 8 appears 10 times? Wait, no, because when the tens digit is 8, it's from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 times. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. So, in the tens place for 400-488, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but earlier, for 100-399, each hundreds group has 10 times for each tens digit. So, for the tens place:\n\n- From 10-99: 10 times each for 4 and 8.\n- From 100-199: 10 times each.\n- From 200-299: 10 times each.\n- From 300-399: 10 times each.\n- From 400-488: 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, total tens place:\n\n4's: 10 (10-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-449) = 50 times.\n\n8's: 10 (10-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (480-488) = 49 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 49 times. So, that's a difference of +1 for 4's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, the digits go from 0 (for 1-99) up to 4 (for 400-488). So, let's see how many times each digit appears in the hundreds place.\n\n- 0: For pages 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, but as with the tens place, since page numbers don't have leading zeros, maybe we don't count the hundreds digit as 0 for pages 1-99. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that the hundreds digit is only present for pages 100 and above. So, for 1-99, there's no hundreds digit, so 0 doesn't appear in the hundreds place. So, the hundreds digit starts at 1 for page 100.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place:\n\n- 1: pages 100-199: 100 times.\n- 2: pages 200-299: 100 times.\n- 3: pages 300-399: 100 times.\n- 4: pages 400-488: 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nWait, let me check that: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times.\n- 8 appears 0 times, since the hundreds digit doesn't reach 8 in 488 pages.\n\nWait, but 8 in the hundreds place would be pages 800-899, which we don't have here. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, the hundreds place contributes 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each place:\n\nUnits place: 49 4's, 49 8's. Difference: 0.\n\nTens place: 50 4's, 49 8's. Difference: +1 for 4's.\n\nHundreds place: 89 4's, 0 8's. Difference: +89 for 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 49 +50=99 +89=188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but wait, in the hundreds place, I thought 4 appears 89 times, but let me confirm that. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those 89 pages. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, in the tens place, I had:\n\n- 10-99: 10 4's and 10 8's.\n- 100-199: 10 4's and 10 8's.\n- 200-299: 10 4's and 10 8's.\n- 300-399: 10 4's and 10 8's.\n- 400-488: 10 4's (from 440-449) and 9 8's (from 480-488).\n\nSo, 4's in tens place: 10+10+10+10+10=50.\n\n8's in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place:\n\n- 100-199: 100 pages, hundreds digit 1: so 1 appears 100 times.\n- Similarly, 2 appears 100 times, 3 appears 100 times.\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n\nSo, 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\n8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 48 complete sets of 10: 48 4's and 48 8's.\n- Remaining 8 pages: 481-488, which have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n- So, total units: 49 each.\n\nSo, 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm supposed to find how many more 4's than 8's, so 90 more 4's.\n\nBut let me think again: did I count correctly in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 8's in the tens place for that last partial hundred. That's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think: when I was counting the tens place in 400-488, I considered that 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages, which is correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I feel like this might be off because 488 isn't that large, but 90 seems a bit high. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by calculating the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nFirst, count the number of 4's in each position:\n\n1. Units place:\n\nAs before, 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48.\n\nRemaining 8 pages: 481-488, which includes 484, so one more 4.\n\nTotal units place 4's: 49.\n\n2. Tens place:\n\nIn each hundred, from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has 10 4's in the tens place (e.g., 140-149, etc.), so 3 hundreds * 10 = 30.\n\nIn 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 more.\n\nTotal tens place 4's: 30 +10=40.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 50. Hmm, this is conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier calculation. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, from 10-99, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 pages, so 10 4's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, from 100-199, the tens digit is 4 for 140-149: 10 pages.\n\nSame for 200-299: 240-249: 10 pages.\n\nSame for 300-399: 340-349: 10 pages.\n\nAnd from 400-488: 440-449: 10 pages.\n\nSo, that's 10 (10-99) +10 (100-199) +10 (200-299) +10 (300-399) +10 (400-449) = 50.\n\nWait, but in my second approach, I only counted 30 +10=40. That's a discrepancy. I must have made a mistake in the second approach.\n\nWait, no, in the second approach, I was only considering the hundreds beyond 100, but I forgot to include the 10-99 range. So, correct total is 50.\n\nSo, tens place 4's: 50.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n\nFrom 400-488: 89 pages, so 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\n1. Units place:\n\n48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 8: 48.\n\nRemaining 8 pages: 481-488 includes 488, so one more 8.\n\nTotal units place 8's: 49.\n\n2. Tens place:\n\nIn each hundred from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each has 10 8's in the tens place (e.g., 180-189, etc.), so 3 hundreds *10=30.\n\nIn 400-488: the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 8's.\n\nTotal tens place 8's: 30 +9=39.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n\nNo 8's, as before.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +39 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 88.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 98. Hmm, this is conflicting. I must have made a mistake in the earlier calculation.\n\nWait, in the first approach, I thought the tens place for 8's was 49, but now I'm getting 39. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the first approach, I considered that from 10-99, the tens digit is 8 for 10 pages (80-89), so 10 8's.\n\nFrom 100-199: 180-189: 10 8's.\n\nFrom 200-299: 280-289:10 8's.\n\nFrom 300-399: 380-389:10 8's.\n\nFrom 400-488: 480-488:9 8's.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9=49.\n\nAh, so in the second approach, I mistakenly only counted 3 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) as contributing 10 each, but I forgot that from 10-99, it's another 10. So, correct total is 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nSo, 4's:188, 8's:98, difference:90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the difference was 90, but when I did the second approach, I got 88, but that was because I made a mistake in counting. So, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, let me just confirm once more.\n\n4's:\n\n- Units:49\n\n- Tens:50\n\n- Hundreds:89\n\nTotal:49+50=99; 99+89=188.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units:49\n\n- Tens:49\n\n- Hundreds:0\n\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding how many more '4's are printed than '8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting '4's and '8's in the Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Complete sets of 10 pages: 48 sets (480 pages).\n     - '4's: 48\n     - '8's: 48\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488):\n     - '4' appears once (484).\n     - '8' appears once (488).\n   - Total Units Place:\n     - '4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n     - '8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Counting '4's and '8's in the Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred (e.g., 100-199) contributes 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the tens place.\n   - From 10-99:\n     - '4's: 10\n     - '8's: 10\n   - From 100-199, 200-299, 300-399:\n     - Each contributes 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the tens place.\n     - Total for three hundreds: 30 '4's and 30 '8's.\n   - From 400-488:\n     - '4's: 10 (440-449)\n     - '8's: 9 (480-488)\n   - Total Tens Place:\n     - '4's: 10 (10-99) + 30 (100-399) + 10 (400-449) = 50\n     - '8's: 10 (10-99) + 30 (100-399) + 9 (480-488) = 49\n\n3. **Counting '4's and '8's in the Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400-488:\n     - '4' appears in the hundreds place for 89 pages (400-488).\n   - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place as pages go up to 488.\n   - Total Hundreds Place:\n     - '4's: 89\n     - '8's: 0\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - More '4's than '8's: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of '4's printed exceeds the number of '8's by 90.  \n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me start by counting the number of 4's first.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: 1 to 9. The only single-digit number with a 4 is 4 itself. So that's one 4.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: 10 to 99. Here, the digits can be in the tens place or the ones place. Let me separate these.\n\nFirst, the tens place. The tens digit can be 4, and the ones digit can be anything from 0 to 9. So, numbers like 40, 41, 42, ..., 49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nNow, the ones place. The ones digit can be 4, and the tens digit can be anything from 1 to 9. So, numbers like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, ..., 94. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences of 4 in the ones place.\n\nWait, but 44 has two 4's, so I might have double-counted that. Let me check: when I counted the tens place, I included 44, and when I counted the ones place, I also included 44. So, in total, for two-digit numbers, I have 10 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 19 occurrences of 4. But 44 was counted twice, so actually, it's 19 digits, but the number 44 has two 4's, so maybe I should just count each digit separately, so 19 digits in total, regardless of how many 4's are in a single number. So, maybe it's correct to say 10 + 9 = 19 4's in two-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but wait, 10 to 99 is 90 numbers, so 9 tens digits (1-9) and 10 ones digits (0-9). So, for each tens digit, 10 ones digits. So, for 4 in the tens place, 10 numbers, and for 4 in the ones place, 9 numbers (since the tens digit can't be 0 in two-digit numbers). So, that's 10 + 9 = 19 4's in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because we have hundreds, tens, and ones places. Let's break it down by each digit place.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, let's consider each case:\n\n- Hundreds digit is 1: 100-199. How many 4's in the hundreds place here? None, because the hundreds digit is 1. So, 0.\n\n- Hundreds digit is 2: 200-299. Similarly, hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's here. 0.\n\n- Hundreds digit is 3: 300-399. Again, hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's. 0.\n\n- Hundreds digit is 4: 400-488. Here, the hundreds digit is 4, so every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. We need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place from 100 to 488.\n\nLet me think: The tens digit can be 0-9, and the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, for each hundreds group, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 100-199. The tens digit is 4 for numbers 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Similarly, 240-249: 10 4's.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3: 300-399. 340-349: 10 4's.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Now, here, the tens digit can be 0-8 because 488 is the last page. So, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit is 4 for numbers 440-449. That's 10 numbers, but wait, does 449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\nWait, but wait: 400-488 includes 400 to 488. So, when the tens digit is 4, the ones digit can be 0-9, but in the case of hundreds digit 4, the tens digit can go up to 8 because 488 is the maximum. So, for hundreds digit 4, the tens digit can be 0-8, so 4 is included, and the ones digit can be 0-9, so 10 numbers: 440-449. So, that's 10 4's in the tens place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, in total, for the tens place in three-digit numbers: 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 10 (hundreds 4) = 40 4's.\n\nWait, but wait: When hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can be 0-8, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 10 4's in the tens place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nNow, moving on to the ones place in three-digit numbers: how many times does 4 appear in the ones place from 100 to 488.\n\nAgain, let's break it down by hundreds digit.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 100-199. The ones digit is 4 for numbers 104, 114, 124, 134, 144, 154, 164, 174, 184, 194. That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Similarly, 204, 214, ..., 294. 10 numbers, 10 4's.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3: 300-399. 304, 314, ..., 394. 10 numbers, 10 4's.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Now, the ones digit is 4 for numbers 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, but 484 is within 488, so that's 9 numbers, because from 404 to 484, stepping by 10, that's 9 numbers: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. So, 9 4's in the ones place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nWait, let me count: starting at 404, then 414 (10 later), up to 484. The number of terms is ((484 - 404)/10) + 1 = (80/10) + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9. So, yes, 9 numbers.\n\nSo, in the ones place for three-digit numbers:\n\n10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 9 (hundreds 4) = 39 4's.\n\nWait, but wait: when hundreds digit is 4, the ones digit can be 4, but the tens digit can be anything from 0 to 8, because the maximum is 488. So, in 400-488, the ones digit is 4 for 404, 414, ..., 484, which is 9 numbers as above. So, yes, 9 4's in the ones place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers:\n\nHundreds place: 89\n\nTens place: 40\n\nOnes place: 39\n\nWait, no, wait: I think I made a mistake here. When I broke down the three-digit numbers, I considered hundreds, tens, and ones places separately. So, the total number of 4's in three-digit numbers is the sum of 4's in each place.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 89 (from 400-488)\n\nTens place: 40 (as calculated above)\n\nOnes place: 39 (as calculated above)\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, let me check that addition: 89 + 40 = 129, then 129 + 39 = 168. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 168\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 = 20, then 20 + 168 = 188.\n\nSo, total number of 4's printed is 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's. I need to count how many times 8 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: 1 to 9. The only single-digit number with an 8 is 8 itself. So, that's one 8.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: 10 to 99.\n\nAgain, let's break it down by tens and ones places.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 for numbers 80-89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\nOnes place: The ones digit is 8 for numbers like 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 numbers (since the tens digit can't be 0 in two-digit numbers), so 9 8's.\n\nWait, but 88 has both digits as 8, so when I count the tens place, I included 88, and when I count the ones place, I also included 88. So, in total, for two-digit numbers, I have 10 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 19 8's. But each occurrence is a separate digit, so it's correct to count them separately. So, 19 8's in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100 to 488.\n\nAgain, let's break it down by hundreds, tens, and ones places.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 100-199. The hundreds digit is 1, so no 8's here. 0.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Hundreds digit is 2, so no 8's. 0.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3: 300-399. Hundreds digit is 3, so no 8's. 0.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Hundreds digit is 4, so no 8's in the hundreds place. 0.\n\nSo, total 8's in the hundreds place in three-digit numbers: 0.\n\nTens place: Now, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place from 100 to 488.\n\nBreaking it down by hundreds digit:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 100-199. The tens digit is 8 for numbers 180-189. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Similarly, 280-289: 10 8's.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3: 300-399. 380-389: 10 8's.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: 400-488. The tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 here, but the ones digit can be 0-8. So, that's 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nWait, but when hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can be 0-8 because the maximum page is 488. So, when the tens digit is 8, the ones digit can only go up to 8, not 9. So, numbers 480-488: that's 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place:\n\n10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 9 (hundreds 4) = 39 8's.\n\nNow, ones place in three-digit numbers: how many times does 8 appear in the ones place from 100 to 488.\n\nAgain, breaking it down by hundreds digit:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 100-199. The ones digit is 8 for numbers 108, 118, 128, 138, 148, 158, 168, 178, 188, 198. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Similarly, 208, 218, ..., 298. 10 numbers, 10 8's.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3: 300-399. 308, 318, ..., 398. 10 numbers, 10 8's.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: 400-488. The ones digit is 8 for numbers 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. Let's count: starting at 408, then 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included, so 9 8's in the ones place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 408 to 488, stepping by 10, how many numbers? 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers, yes.\n\nSo, total 8's in the ones place:\n\n10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 9 (hundreds 4) = 39 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure: in hundreds digit 4, the ones digit can be 8, but the tens digit can be up to 8 because the maximum is 488. So, 488 is included, so 488 is counted as one of the 8's in the ones place.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\nTens place: 39\n\nOnes place: 39\n\nWait, no, wait: the hundreds place had 0, the tens place had 39, and the ones place had 39. So, total 8's in three-digit numbers: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\n- Tens place: 39\n\n- Ones place: 39\n\nTotal: 78 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 78\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 = 20, then 20 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, total number of 8's printed is 98.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the counts because I might have made a mistake in the three-digit numbers.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\n- Tens place: 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 10 (hundreds 4) = 40.\n\n- Ones place: 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 9 (hundreds 4) = 39.\n\nTotal 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. Then, adding single-digit and two-digit: 1 + 19 = 20, so total 4's: 168 + 20 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\n- Tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\n- Ones place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nTotal 8's in three-digit: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nAdding single-digit and two-digit: 1 + 19 = 20, so total 8's: 78 + 20 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the three-digit counts, especially for the ones place when hundreds digit is 4.\n\nFor the ones place in three-digit numbers, when hundreds digit is 4, the ones digit is 8 for numbers 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for hundreds digit 4, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: in the tens place for hundreds digit 4, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. That's correct.\n\nIn the ones place, it's 9 numbers as well. So, that's 18 8's for hundreds digit 4 in three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, no, no: in the tens place, it's 9 8's, and in the ones place, it's 9 8's, so total for hundreds digit 4 is 18 8's.\n\nBut when I added up earlier, I had 39 in tens and 39 in ones, which included all hundreds digits. So, let me see:\n\n- Tens place: 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 9 (hundreds 4) = 39.\n\n- Ones place: 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 9 (hundreds 4) = 39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nAdding single-digit and two-digit: 1 + 19 = 20. So, total 8's: 78 + 20 = 98.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miss anything in the two-digit numbers.\n\nFor two-digit numbers:\n\n- Tens place: 10 4's (40-49)\n\n- Ones place: 9 4's (14,24,...,94)\n\nTotal 19 4's.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\n- Tens place: 10 8's (80-89)\n\n- Ones place: 9 8's (18,28,...,98)\n\nTotal 19 8's.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nIn single-digit numbers, 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\n8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start with the units place.\n\nFor the units place, I can think of how often 4 and 8 appear in the ones digit. For every block of 10 numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., each digit from 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, in each block of 10, there's exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and an extra 8 pages. So, in the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1, which is 48, plus any additional 4's in the last partial block. Wait, the last partial block is 481-488, so the units digits here are 1 through 8. So, in this partial block, the units digit 4 appears once, and 8 appears once. So, total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49 as well. Hmm, so in the units place, they are equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0-9 ten times each. Wait, actually, in 1-100, each tens digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times in 40-49, and similarly, 8 appears 10 times in 80-89. So, for each 100 pages, the tens digit 4 and 8 each appear 10 times. Now, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an extra 88 pages (401-488). So, in each of the 4 complete hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4*10=40 times for 4's. Similarly, 8's in the tens place would be 4*10=40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, let's see: 401-410 has tens digit 0, 411-420 has 1, 421-430 has 2, 431-440 has 3, 441-450 has 4, 451-460 has 5, 461-470 has 6, 471-480 has 7, and 481-488 has 8. So, in this partial hundred, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 times. So, adding to the previous counts, 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48. So, in the tens place, 4's are more than 8's by 2.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears in pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. On the other hand, the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nNow, let's tally up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nNow, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, plus 1 in the last partial block, so 49 each for 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40 each. Then, in the last partial hundred, 441-450 adds 10 for 4's, and 481-488 adds 8 for 8's. So, 40 +10=50 for 4's, and 40 +8=48 for 8's. That's correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 4's, and 0 8's. Correct.\n\nAdding up: 49+50+89=188 and 49+48=97. 188-97=91.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. When I have 488 pages, the last page is 488. So, in the units place, for each 10 pages, from 1-10, 11-20, etc., each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, for 488, how many complete tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 complete tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units 4's: 48+1=49, units 8's:48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds, 10 each, so 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, 441-450 has tens digit 4, which is 10 pages, so 10 4's. 481-488 has tens digit 8, but only 8 pages (481-488), so 8 8's. So, tens 4's: 40+10=50, tens 8's:40+8=48. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: Only 400-488 have hundreds digit 4, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's. 8's in hundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188, 8's:49+48=97. So, 188-97=91. Therefore, 4's are printed 91 more times than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let's start by counting the number of 4's in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears once. How many sets of 10 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, the tens place: Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For each hundred, the tens digit goes through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (e.g., 40-49). How many hundreds do we have? From 1-488, there are four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4*10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. The 40's would be 400-409, but wait, 401-409 is actually part of the 400-499 range, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit 4 appears in 400-409, but 400 is included, right? Wait, 400 is page 400, which is part of the 400-409 range. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears from 400-409, but since 400 is included, that's 10 numbers (400-409), but wait, 400 is page 400, so in the range 400-488, the tens digit 4 is present from 400-409, which is 10 pages, but 400 is included, so that's 10 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 400-409 is within 401-488? No, 400 is page 400, which is included, but 401-409 is part of the 400-499 range. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: From 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, etc., up to 8 for 481-490, but 490 is beyond 488, so up to 488. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears only in 400-409, which is 10 numbers. So, in the partial hundred, we have 10 more 4's in the tens place. So total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check: Each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so yes, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's similarly.\n\nStarting with the units place: Same as before, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10 (480 numbers) and 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full set, 8 appears once, so 48 times. In the extra 8 numbers, units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89). So, in each full hundred, that's 10 times. We have four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4*10 = 40 times. Now, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes up to 8, so in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. Wait, 480 is part of 480-488, but 480 is page 480, which is in the 400-488 range. So, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me confirm: From 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (480-489). But since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nCounting 4's:\n- Units: 48 full decades (1-480) with 1 each, so 48, plus 481-488 has 484, which is 4 in units, so 49.\n- Tens: Each hundred has 10, so 4*10=40, plus in 400-488, the tens digit 4 is in 400-409, which is 10, so 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nCounting 8's:\n- Units: 48 full decades, 1 each, plus 488, so 49.\n- Tens: Each hundred has 10, so 4*10=40, plus in 401-488, tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9, so 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** Every 10 numbers contribute one 4. There are 48 full decades (1-480) and 8 extra numbers (481-488), where 484 has a 4 in the units place. Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n- **Tens place:** Each hundred contributes 10 4's. Four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) give 40. In 400-488, 400-409 adds 10. Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 includes 89 numbers with 4 in the hundreds place. Total: 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 48 full decades and 488 contribute 49.\n- **Tens place:** Each hundred contributes 10 8's, totaling 40. In 401-488, 480-488 adds 9. Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me start by counting the number of 4's first.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: pages 1 through 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears exactly once, on page 4. So, that's one 4. Now, moving on to two-digit page numbers: from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place.\n\nFor the tens place: The numbers from 40 to 49 have 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so that's 10 occurrences of 4. For the units place: The numbers ending with 4 between 10 and 99 are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, and 94. That's 9 numbers, but wait, 44 has two 4's, so does that count twice? Hmm, but since I'm only counting the occurrence of the digit 4 in each position, each of these numbers contributes one 4 in the units place. So, 9 times. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, so does that mean I should count both the tens and units place? Wait, no, because when I'm counting the tens place separately, I already counted the 4 in the tens place for 40-49, including 44. So, in the units place, 44 contributes another 4. So, in total, the units place from 10-99 gives 9 4's. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nNow, for three-digit page numbers: from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because there are three places: hundreds, tens, and units. Let me break it down by each place.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, pages 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nFor 4's in the hundreds place: Only pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these contributes one 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers: I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens digit across all three-digit page numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nThe tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.\n\nBut wait, for the 400-488 range, the tens digit can go up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. However, since 488 is the last page, do we have to adjust for that? Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's 10 numbers.\n\nSo, for each hundred:\n\n- 100-199: tens digit 4 occurs in 140-149: 10 numbers.\n- 200-299: 240-249: 10 numbers.\n- 300-399: 340-349: 10 numbers.\n- 400-488: 440-449: 10 numbers.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is only up to 488, but 449 is within that range, so yes, 10 numbers. So, total 4's in the tens place across all three-digit numbers: 10 (100s) + 10 (200s) + 10 (300s) + 10 (400s) = 40.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers: Similarly, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in each hundred, the units digit is 4 once every 10 pages. So, for each hundred, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nFrom 100-199: The units digit is 4 in 104, 114, 124, ..., 194. That's 10 times (since 100 + 4, 110 +4, ..., 190 +4). Similarly, 200-299: 204, 214, ..., 294: 10 times. 300-399: 304, 314, ..., 394: 10 times. 400-488: Now, 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, 400-488: Let's see, starting at 404, then every 10 pages. So, 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. Wait, 400-488: The units digit 4 occurs at 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. So, that's 9 times, right? Because after 484, the next would be 494, which is beyond 488. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in the units place across three-digit numbers:\n\n10 (100s) + 10 (200s) + 10 (300s) + 9 (400s) = 39.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. For 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Starting at 404, each 10 pages. So, 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers. So, yes, 9.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers:\n\nHundreds place: 89\n\nTens place: 40\n\nUnits place: 39\n\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. So, total 4's from 100-488 is 168.\n\nNow, let me add the single-digit and two-digit 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 168\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, the hundreds place: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nTens place: For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each. So, 4 hundreds, 10 each: 40. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: For 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each has 10 numbers ending with 4, so 10 each, totaling 30. Then, 400-488: 9 numbers ending with 4. So, total 39. That adds up.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 in three-digit numbers. Then, single-digit:1, two-digit:19. 1+19=20, plus 168=188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in all page numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit: pages 1-9. The digit 8 appears once, on page 8. So, that's 1.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: 10-99.\n\nTens place: The numbers from 80-89 have 8 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\nUnits place: Numbers ending with 8 between 10-99: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers. But wait, 88 has two 8's, so does that count twice? No, because when counting the units place, each occurrence is counted once. So, 9 times in the units place.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nNow, three-digit numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1,2,3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place in these numbers because the hundreds digit is only up to 4. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit is 8 in the range x80-x89. So, for each hundred, that's 10 numbers. So, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place: 40.\n\nWait, but for 400-488, the tens digit can go up to 8, so 480-488 is part of that. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, but that's only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), but wait, no: the tens digit is 8, so it's 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, does that affect the count?\n\nWait, no. Because when we're considering the tens digit being 8, it's from x80-x89, which is 10 numbers regardless of the hundreds digit. But in the case of 400-488, the tens digit 8 would be in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9 numbers. So, does that mean that in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 appears only 9 times instead of 10?\n\nWait, yes. Because normally, x80-x89 is 10 numbers, but in 400-488, the last number is 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. Therefore, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times instead of 10.\n\nSo, let me adjust that. For the hundreds:\n\n- 100-199: tens digit 8: 10 numbers (180-189)\n- 200-299: 280-289: 10\n- 300-399: 380-389: 10\n- 400-488: 480-488: 9\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: 10 +10 +10 +9 = 39.\n\nNow, units place in three-digit numbers: The units digit is 8 in numbers ending with 8. So, for each hundred, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nFrom 100-199: 108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198: 10 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, 200-299: 208,218,...,298: 10.\n\n300-399: 308,318,...,398: 10.\n\n400-488: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Let's count: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 498 would be next, but we stop at 488.\n\nSo, units place 8's:\n\n100-199:10\n\n200-299:10\n\n300-399:10\n\n400-488:9\n\nTotal: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\nTens place:39\n\nUnits place:39\n\nTotal: 39+39=78.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For the tens place, we had 39, and units place 39, so total 78.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:78\n\nTotal:1+19=20 +78=98.\n\nSo, total 8's:98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's:188, total 8's:98.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1 (page4)\n\nTwo-digit:\n\nTens place:40-49:10\n\nUnits place:14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94:9\n\nTotal two-digit 4's:19\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place:400-488:89\n\nTens place:10 (100s) +10 (200s)+10 (300s)+9 (400s)=39\n\nUnits place:10 (100s)+10 (200s)+10 (300s)+9 (400s)=39\n\nTotal three-digit 4's:89+39+39=167? Wait, earlier I had 89+40+39=168. Hmm, now I'm confused.\n\nWait, in the tens place for three-digit numbers, I had:\n\n100-199:10\n\n200-299:10\n\n300-399:10\n\n400-488:9 (because 480-488 is only 9 numbers, but wait, no. Wait, when counting the tens digit as 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, right? Because 440 to 449 is 10 pages. Similarly, in the units place, 400-488:404,414,...,484:9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. So, in the tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 in the 400s. So, in the tens place, 10+10+10+10=40. So, 40 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 39.\n\nSo, total three-digit 4's:89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units)=168.\n\nSo, total 4's:1+19+168=188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1 (page8)\n\nTwo-digit:\n\nTens place:80-89:10\n\nUnits place:18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98:9\n\nTotal two-digit 8's:19\n\nThree-digit:\n\nTens place:100-199:10 (180-189)\n\n200-299:10 (280-289)\n\n300-399:10 (380-389)\n\n400-488:9 (480-488)\n\nTotal tens place 8's:10+10+10+9=39\n\nUnits place:\n\n100-199:10 (108,118,...,198)\n\n200-299:10\n\n300-399:10\n\n400-488:9 (408,418,...,488)\n\nTotal units place 8's:10+10+10+9=39\n\nSo, total three-digit 8's:39+39=78\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot, but maybe that's correct. Let me think about another way to calculate this.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately.\n\nFor each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nTotal numbers:488\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of times each digit appears in units place: For each digit 0-9, it appears floor(488/10)=48 times for each digit, but since 488 is not a multiple of 10, the last partial set (480-488) has 9 numbers. So, for digits 0-9, except for 8, which in the last partial set would have one more.\n\nWait, no, actually, for units digit:\n\nEach digit from 0-9 appears equally in the units place except possibly the last set.\n\nTotal complete sets of 10:48 (since 48*10=480), and then 8 more numbers (481-488).\n\nSo, for each digit 0-9:\n\n- Digits 0-8: appear 48 times each in the units place.\n\n- Digit 9: appears 48 times (from 9,19,...,489, but wait, 488 is the last, so 9 appears 48 times as well, but 489 is beyond 488, so actually, digit 9 appears 48 times in units place up to 489, but since we stop at 488, digit 9 appears 48 times as well.\n\nWait, no, because 488 is the last page, so units digits go up to 8. So, digit 9 appears 48 times in the units place (from 9,19,...,479,489 is beyond, so actually, digit 9 appears 48 times as well because 480-488 doesn't include 489. Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so digit 0 appears once more in 480, but digits 1-8 appear once more in 481-488. So, digits 1-8 appear 49 times each, and digits 0 and 9 appear 48 times each.\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nTotal numbers:488\n\nNumber of complete decades:48 (48*10=480), with 8 remaining numbers:481-488.\n\nIn each complete decade (0-9, 10-19,...,470-479), each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, for 48 complete decades, each digit appears 48 times.\n\nNow, the remaining 8 numbers:481-488.\n\nTheir units digits are 1-8, so digits 1-8 each appear once more. So, digits 1-8:48+1=49 times.\n\nDigits 0 and 9:48 times.\n\nSo, in units place:\n\n- 4 appears 49 times.\n\n- 8 appears 49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I counted manually, I had 4's in units place as 39. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So, perhaps my initial manual count was wrong.\n\nWait, let's see. According to this, in the units place, 4 appears 49 times. But when I counted earlier, I had:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:9\n\nThree-digit:39\n\nTotal:1+9+39=49. Oh, that's correct. So, 49 times in units place.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears 49 times in units place.\n\nNow, moving to tens place:\n\nSimilarly, for tens digit, each digit 0-9 appears in the tens place for each hundred.\n\nTotal hundreds:4 (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n\nFor each hundred, except the last one, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place (0-9), except for the last hundred, 400-488.\n\nIn 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place for 400-488:\n\nDigits 0-8 appear 10 times each (for 400-488, the tens digit cycles 0-8, each appearing 10 times except for the last digit, which is 8, but actually, no, because 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8, which is 9 numbers, but wait, no, the tens digit is determined by the second digit. So, 400-488:\n\n- Tens digit 0:400-409:10 numbers\n\n- Tens digit 1:410-419:10\n\n- ...\n\n- Tens digit 8:480-488:9 numbers\n\nSo, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, while others appear 10 times.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\n- For hundreds 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\n- For 400-488: digits 0-7 appear 10 times, digit 8 appears 9 times, and digit 9 doesn't appear.\n\nSo, total tens place counts:\n\n- Digits 0-7: 3 hundreds *10 +1 hundred *10 =40 each.\n\n- Digit 8:3 hundreds *10 +1 hundred *9=39.\n\n- Digit 9:3 hundreds *10 +0=30.\n\nWait, but 400-488 doesn't include 490-499, so digit 9 in tens place doesn't appear in 400-488.\n\nWait, but in 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so digit 9 doesn't appear in the tens place.\n\nSo, total tens place:\n\n- 0-7:40 each.\n\n- 8:39.\n\n- 9:30.\n\nSo, for digit 4 in tens place:40 times.\n\nFor digit 8 in tens place:39 times.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nDigits in hundreds place:1,2,3,4.\n\nEach appears 100 times except for 4, which appears 89 times (from 400-488).\n\nSo, digit 4 in hundreds place:89 times.\n\nDigits 1,2,3 in hundreds place:100 times each.\n\nDigit 8 in hundreds place:0 times.\n\nSo, total counts:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place:49\n\n- Tens place:40\n\n- Hundreds place:89\n\nTotal 4's:49+40+89=178.\n\nWait, earlier I had 188. Hmm, discrepancy here. Wait, let's see.\n\nWait, in the units place, according to the digit analysis, 4 appears 49 times. In the tens place, 40 times. In the hundreds place,89 times. So, total 4's:49+40+89=178.\n\nBut earlier, when I manually counted, I had 188. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let's see. The digit analysis seems more accurate because it's a systematic way. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the manual count.\n\nWait, in the manual count, I had:\n\nSingle-digit 4's:1\n\nTwo-digit 4's:19\n\nThree-digit 4's:168\n\nTotal:1+19+168=188.\n\nBut according to the digit analysis, it's 178.\n\nSo, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, when I counted the hundreds place, I had 89, which is correct.\n\nIn the tens place, I had 40, which matches the digit analysis.\n\nIn the units place, I had 39 in three-digit numbers, but according to the digit analysis, it's 49. So, that's where the discrepancy is.\n\nWait, in the manual count, I had:\n\nThree-digit units place 4's:39\n\nBut according to digit analysis, it's 49.\n\nWait, that suggests that in the units place, 4 appears 49 times, which includes single-digit and two-digit numbers as well.\n\nWait, no, the digit analysis is per digit position across all numbers. So, in the units place, 4 appears 49 times in total, which includes single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nSimilarly, in the manual count, I had:\n\nSingle-digit units 4's:1\n\nTwo-digit units 4's:9\n\nThree-digit units 4's:39\n\nTotal:1+9+39=49, which matches the digit analysis.\n\nSo, in the manual count, the three-digit units 4's are 39, but when adding to single and two-digit, it becomes 49, which is correct.\n\nSo, in the manual count, I had:\n\nThree-digit 4's: hundreds=89, tens=40, units=39. Total=168.\n\nBut according to digit analysis, 4's in hundreds=89, tens=40, units=49. So, total=89+40+49=178.\n\nWait, so I must have made a mistake in the manual count by subtracting something incorrectly.\n\nWait, in the manual count, I had:\n\nThree-digit units 4's:39\n\nBut according to digit analysis, it's 49.\n\nSo, perhaps in the manual count, I undercounted the units place in three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, in the manual count, I had:\n\nThree-digit units 4's:10 (100s) +10 (200s) +10 (300s) +9 (400s)=39.\n\nBut according to digit analysis, it's 49. So, that suggests that in the three-digit numbers, units digit 4's are 39, but when adding single and two-digit, it's 49. So, the manual count is correct, and the digit analysis is also correct because the digit analysis is across all numbers, including single and two-digit.\n\nWait, but in the manual count, I separated single, two, and three-digit numbers, so the three-digit units 4's are 39, plus single-digit 1 and two-digit 9, totaling 49, which matches the digit analysis.\n\nSo, in the manual count, the three-digit 4's are:\n\nHundreds:89\n\nTens:40\n\nUnits:39\n\nTotal:168\n\nBut when adding single and two-digit, it's 1+19=20, plus 168=188.\n\nBut according to digit analysis, 4's total is 178.\n\nSo, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps in the manual count, I overcounted the two-digit 4's.\n\nIn the manual count, two-digit 4's were 10 (tens) +9 (units)=19.\n\nBut according to digit analysis, in the tens place, 4 appears 40 times in three-digit, but in two-digit, it's 10 (40-49). So, total 4's in tens place:10 (two-digit) +40 (three-digit)=50.\n\nSimilarly, in units place, 4's:9 (two-digit) +39 (three-digit)=48, but digit analysis says 49. So, perhaps I missed one in the two-digit units place.\n\nWait, in two-digit units place, numbers ending with 4 are 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94: that's 9 numbers, but 44 has two 4's, so does that count as two? No, because we're counting the occurrence of the digit, not the number of times the digit appears in the number. So, each occurrence is counted once per digit position. So, 44 contributes one 4 in the tens place and one in the units place. So, in the two-digit units place, 44 is counted once, so 9 times.\n\nBut according to digit analysis, units place 4's are 49, which includes single-digit (1), two-digit (9), and three-digit (39). So, 1+9=10 in single and two-digit, plus 39=49.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nBut in the manual count, the three-digit 4's are 168, which includes hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nSo, 89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units)=168.\n\nThen, adding single-digit and two-digit 4's:1+19=20.\n\nTotal 4's:168+20=188.\n\nBut according to digit analysis, it's 178.\n\nSo, there's a discrepancy of 10.\n\nWait, perhaps the digit analysis is considering that in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, but in the tens place, 40, and units 49, totaling 89+40+49=178.\n\nBut in the manual count, it's 89+40+39=168 for three-digit, plus 20=188.\n\nSo, the difference is 10.\n\nWait, perhaps in the manual count, I missed that in the three-digit units place, 4's are 39, but according to digit analysis, it's 49. So, I think the manual count is wrong.\n\nWait, no, because in the manual count, three-digit units 4's are 39, plus single and two-digit units 4's=10, totaling 49.\n\nSo, the manual count is correct.\n\nBut according to digit analysis, 4's in hundreds=89, tens=40, units=49, total=178.\n\nBut in the manual count, 4's in three-digit are 89+40+39=168, plus single and two-digit=20, total=188.\n\nSo, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the digit analysis is incorrect because it's not considering that in the hundreds place, 4 appears only in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears 40 times.\n\nIn the units place, 49 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:89+40+49=178.\n\nBut in the manual count, I have 188.\n\nSo, the difference is 10.\n\nWait, perhaps in the manual count, I overcounted the two-digit 4's.\n\nWait, in two-digit 4's, I had 10 in tens (40-49) and 9 in units (14,24,...,94). That's 19.\n\nBut according to digit analysis, in the tens place, 4's are 40 (including two-digit 10 and three-digit 30). Wait, no, the digit analysis counts tens place 4's as 40 in total, which includes two-digit (10) and three-digit (30). So, 10+30=40.\n\nSimilarly, units place 4's are 49, which includes single-digit (1), two-digit (9), and three-digit (39).\n\nSo, in manual count, three-digit 4's in tens place are 30, but I had 40. Wait, no, in manual count, I had:\n\nThree-digit tens 4's:10 (100s)+10 (200s)+10 (300s)+10 (400s)=40.\n\nBut according to digit analysis, tens place 4's are 40 in total, which includes two-digit 10 and three-digit 30. So, in manual count, I have three-digit tens 4's as 40, but according to digit analysis, it's 30.\n\nSo, that's the mistake. In manual count, I counted"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit position separately\u2014units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by considering each position one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each full block, 4 appears once, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484). So total for units place is 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each of the 4 full hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in the numbers 440-449. That's another 10 times. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488. So, that's 10 more. So total for tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times. Wait, but wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. But wait, let me check: 400 is the first, 401, 402, ..., up to 488. So, yes, 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times.\n\nWait, but wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because when considering the hundreds place, for numbers 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's zero. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, etc. So, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 times for the digit 4.\n\nNow, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, in every block of 10, 8 appears once. So, how many full blocks of 10 are there up to 488? As before, 48 full blocks and a partial block of 8. So, 48 times in full blocks, plus 1 in the partial block (488), so total 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: in the last partial block, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So yes, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, how many full blocks are there?\n\nFrom 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in the following blocks:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, total occurrences in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, yes, 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times.\n\nWait, but wait a minute, let me double-check the tens place for 8. So, 80-89 is 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, correct. Then 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 10 +10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place, 488 is included, so 8 appears once in the units place in 488, plus 48 times in the full blocks, so 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4. I had 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Then, the tens place for 4: in each hundred, 10 times, so 4*10=40, and then in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, so total 50. Units place: 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, plus 1 in 484, so 49. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds:0, so 98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly for the hundreds place for 4. From 400 to 488, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens digit for 4: in each hundred, 10 times, so 4 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only part of the fourth hundred. So, in the first three hundreds (100-399), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each, so 3*10=30. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total 30+10=40. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 50. Wait, no, wait, I think I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, in the initial calculation, I considered that from 1-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 times, so 50 times. But wait, in the hundreds 1-3, it's 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, which is 4 blocks, each 10 times, so 40. Then, in 400-488, 440-449 is another 10. So total 50. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I thought of 100-399, that's 3 hundreds, each with a 4 in the tens place for 10 numbers, so 3*10=30. Then, in 400-488, 440-449 is another 10, so total 40. Wait, but that contradicts the earlier count of 50. Hmm, I'm confused now.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm miscounting the blocks. Let me list them:\n\n- 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers)\n- 100-199: 140-149 (10)\n- 200-299: 240-249 (10)\n- 300-399: 340-349 (10)\n- 400-488: 440-449 (10)\n\nSo, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 times. So, yes, 50 times for the tens place. So, I think my initial count was correct.\n\nSo, the total for 4's is 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nFor 8's, units: 49, tens:49, hundreds:0, so 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for 8. In each block of 10, 8 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48, and then in the last partial block (481-488), 8 appears once (488). So, 48 +1=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place for 8: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nSo, total 49 +49=98.\n\nTherefore, 4's:188, 8's:98, difference 90.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by considering each position one by one for both 4 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Divided by 10, that's 48 full blocks and a remainder of 8. So, in each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once here as well (484). So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: For the tens digit, 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, 10 times. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many such blocks are there? From 1 to 488, we have four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 is the last part. So, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers, and then in 140-149, another 10, and 240-249, another 10, and 340-349, another 10. So that's 4 times 10, which is 40. But wait, 400-488: the tens digit from 400-488 is 0-8, so when the tens digit is 4, that's 440-449, which is another 10. So, total 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, no, because 400-488 is part of the 400s, so the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total tens place 4's: 40 (from the first four hundreds) plus 10 from 440-449, totaling 50.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. For the tens place, every 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, from 1 to 400, that's 4 sets of 100, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 0-8, so the 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449, which is another 10 times. So, total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since our book ends at 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 in all of them, so 89 times. So, hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 +50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Only from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, as I thought, 40 times from 1-400, and then another 10 times in 440-449, so 50 times.\n\nIn the units place, 48 full tens (each contributing one 4 in units place) plus one more in 484, so 49 times.\n\nSo, 89 +50 +49 = 188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nStarting with units place: Similar to 4's, every block of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). So, 48 times in the units place, plus one more in 488, so 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so yes, 48 full blocks (each contributing one 8) and the last partial block contributes one more (488). So, units place 8's: 49.\n\nTens place: For the tens digit, 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nFrom 1-488, the hundreds go up to 4. So, in each hundred, there's one block where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, in the tens place, how many 8's?\n\nFrom 1-400: There are four hundreds, each contributing one block of 10 where the tens digit is 8, so 4*10=40.\n\nFrom 401-488: The tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 times.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, so 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, right? So, 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, so 4's are 188 and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, as I calculated earlier.\n\nIn the units place, 49 times.\n\nSo, 89+50=139, plus 49 is 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 49 times.\n\nTens place: 40 from 1-400, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure. Let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's digit by digit.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place: For each 10 numbers, 4 appears once. 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and in the last partial ten (481-488), 484 is present, so one more. So, 48+1=49.\n\nTens place: For each 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 488 /100=4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40+10=50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: Each 10 numbers, 8 appears once. 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and in the last partial ten (481-488), 488 is present, so one more. So, 48+1=49.\n\nTens place: Each 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. 488 /100=4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: No 8's, as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me check once more to be sure.\n\nWait, for the tens place in 8's: From 1-400, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, which is 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 40+9=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place: From 1-400, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, which is 4 blocks, 10 each, so 40. Then, from 401-488, 440-449, which is another 10, so 50 total. Correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48 full tens, 484, so 49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 8's: 48 full tens, 488, so 49. Correct.\n\nSo, 4's total: 188, 8's: 98, difference 90.\n\nYes, I think that's right.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every block of 10 numbers contributes one 4.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, totaling 48.\n   - The last partial block (481-488) includes 484, adding one more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every block of 100 numbers contributes 10 4's in the tens place.\n   - 488 \u00f7 100 = 4 full blocks, each contributing 10, totaling 40.\n   - From 401-488, 440-449 contributes another 10.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every block of 10 numbers contributes one 8.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, totaling 48.\n   - The last partial block (481-488) includes 488, adding one more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every block of 100 numbers contributes 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - 488 \u00f7 100 = 4 full blocks, each contributing 10, totaling 40.\n   - From 401-488, 480-488 contributes 9 more.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place (pages 800-899 are beyond 488).\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by counting the number of 4's and 8's in each place.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once in each block of 10. Now, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 more numbers. In each of these 48 blocks, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once more in 484. Therefore, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, for 8's in the units place, in each block of 10, there's one 8. So, 48 blocks give 48 eights, and in the remaining 8 numbers, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that's the same number. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. Wait, no, 488 is page 488, so the units digit is 8, so yes, that's correct. So, both 4's and 8's in the units place occur 49 times each. So, so far, the count is 49 for both.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each block of 100, the tens digit is 4 for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. Similarly, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more numbers (401-488). In each of these 4 blocks, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers in each block, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in the tens place. So, for the tens digit being 4, that's 10 numbers: 440-449. Similarly, for the tens digit being 8, that's 10 numbers: 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, no, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since we're stopping at 488, it's 9 numbers. Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. Wait, no, that's incorrect. The tens digit is 8 from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the remaining 88 numbers. Therefore, total 4's in the tens place are 40 (from the 4 blocks) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. Wait, no, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's. For 8's, it's 40 (from the 4 blocks) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 4's in tens place: 50, 8's in tens place: 49. So, so far, 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99, and 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Wait, but I'm not done yet because I haven't considered the hundreds place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 times. The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be for pages 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems like a big difference. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- Each block of 10 has one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n- Number of complete blocks: 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 blocks of 10).\n- So, 48 * 1 = 48 for both 4's and 8's.\n- Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8.\n- So, 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488).\n- So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4's and 8's.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49) and 10 where it's 8 (e.g., 80-89).\n- Number of complete blocks of 100: 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400).\n- So, 4 * 10 = 40 for both 4's and 8's in the tens place.\n- Remaining 88 numbers: 401-488.\n- In 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8.\n- For 4's in tens place: 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n- For 8's in tens place: 480-489, but since we stop at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n- So, 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n- 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's in the hundreds place were 89, which is correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. When I'm in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. The tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, correct.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, yes.\n\nSo, 4's in tens place: 50, 8's in tens place: 49.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place would contribute more, but 89 is correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another way to count the hundreds place: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each, so 89 times. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not overcounting. For example, in the number 444, does that count as three 4's? Yes, because each digit place is counted separately. So, in units, tens, and hundreds, each occurrence is counted. Similarly, 488 would have two 8's in the tens and units place, but I think I counted each digit place separately, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, when I counted 480-488 as 9 numbers, each of those has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 eights in the tens place. Similarly, in the units place, 488 is one 8. So, that's correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488. \n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 48 complete blocks (1-480) give 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total: 49 each.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - 4 complete blocks (1-400) give 40 each.\n   - The remaining 88 numbers (401-488) add 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear.\n   - Total: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by considering each place one by one.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's and 8's in the units place. For the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, there's exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 pages. So, in each of these 48 blocks, we have one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so that's 48 4's and 48 8's. Now, the extra 8 pages from 481 to 488. Let's check the units digits here: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. The units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in these extra pages, there's one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488). So, in total, the units place contributes 48 + 1 = 49 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 8's. Wait, so for units place, the count is the same for both 4's and 8's. So, 49 each. So, no difference here.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every 10 numbers. For example, from 1-9, the tens digit is 0, then 10-19 have 1 in the tens place, 20-29 have 2, and so on. So, in each block of 100 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for each digit, there are 10 occurrences in the tens place every 100 numbers. Now, how many full hundreds are there in 488 pages? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, let's calculate the number of 4's and 8's in the tens place.\n\nFirst, in each full hundred, how many times does the digit 4 appear in the tens place? It's 10 times, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, from 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, for each hundred, 10 4's and 10 8's. Since there are 4 full hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 4's and 4*10 = 40 8's in the tens place from the full hundreds. Now, the remaining pages are from 401 to 488. Let's check the tens digits here. The tens digit cycles every 10 pages. So, 401-410: tens digit is 0, 411-420: tens digit is 1, 421-430: tens digit is 2, 431-440: tens digit is 3, 441-450: tens digit is 4, 451-460: tens digit is 5, 461-470: tens digit is 6, 471-480: tens digit is 7, and 481-488: tens digit is 8. So, in this partial hundred, how many 4's and 8's are in the tens place? Let's see:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 \u2192 no 4's or 8's.\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 \u2192 no.\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 \u2192 no.\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 \u2192 no.\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 \u2192 10 times. So, 10 4's.\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 \u2192 no.\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 \u2192 no.\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 \u2192 no.\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 \u2192 8 times (since it's only 8 pages: 481-488).\n\nWait, but from 481-488, the tens digit is 8, and there are 8 numbers here, so the digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place. So, in the partial hundred (401-488), we have 10 4's and 8 8's in the tens place.\n\nAdding this to the full hundreds: 40 + 10 = 50 4's and 40 + 8 = 48 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 50 4's and 48 8's. So, 50 - 48 = 2 more 4's than 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, which doesn't count. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299 is 2; 300-399 is 3; and 400-488 is 4. So, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- 100-199: hundreds digit is 1 \u2192 100 times.\n- 200-299: hundreds digit is 2 \u2192 100 times.\n- 300-399: hundreds digit is 3 \u2192 100 times.\n- 400-488: hundreds digit is 4 \u2192 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nWait, is that right? From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, for the digit 8 in the hundreds place: since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, we have 89 4's and 0 8's. So, that's 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each place:\n\n- Units place: 49 4's and 49 8's \u2192 difference 0.\n- Tens place: 50 4's and 48 8's \u2192 difference +2.\n- Hundreds place: 89 4's and 0 8's \u2192 difference +89.\n\nAdding these differences: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488), so total units 4's: 48 +1=49, same for 8's: 49. So, correct.\n\nTens place: In the full hundreds (1-400), each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds \u2192 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digits where 4 and 8 appear are 441-450 (10 times 4) and 481-488 (8 times 8). So, 10 4's and 8 8's. So, total tens 4's: 40 +10=50, tens 8's:40 +8=48. So, difference +2. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. 8 never appears in hundreds place. So, difference +89.\n\nSo, total difference: 0 +2 +89=91. So, 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there any other place where 8 might appear? No, because 8 is only in units and tens, and hundreds only go up to 4. So, yes, I think that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 48 full blocks (480 pages) contribute 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - Pages 481-488 add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 pages contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - 4 full hundreds (400 pages) contribute 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - Pages 401-488 contribute 10 4's (441-450) and 8 8's (481-488).\n   - Total: 50 4's and 48 8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n   - No 8's appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nSumming the differences:\n- Units: 0\n- Tens: +2\n- Hundreds: +89\nTotal difference: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me think about each position one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place. For each set of ten numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in every block of ten numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then considering any remainder. Wait, but since 488 isn't a multiple of 10, I need to handle that. Let me see: 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, for the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times, and then for the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, digits 1 through 8 appear one more time each. Therefore, the digit 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place, and the digit 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times as well. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so the units digits go up to 8. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust my calculation. Let me think again. For the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in each block of 10. So, up to page 480, there are 48 blocks of 10, so each digit appears 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 through 8, so digits 1-8 each get an extra count. Therefore, digit 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and digit 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. So, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place. That means in the units place, they're equal, so the difference comes from the tens and hundreds places.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, in 0-99, the tens digits go from 0 (for 0-9) to 9 (for 90-99), each appearing 10 times. Similarly, in 100-199, the tens digits go from 0 (100-109) to 9 (190-199), each appearing 10 times. So, for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. Now, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? There are four hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and then 400-488. Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so we have four complete hundreds (0-399) and then 400-488. Let me clarify: 0-99 is the first hundred, 100-199 the second, 200-299 the third, and 300-399 the fourth. Then, 400-488 is the fifth hundred, but it's incomplete. So, for the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each complete hundred. So, in the first four hundreds (0-399), each digit appears 4 times 10 = 40 times in the tens place. Now, let's look at the incomplete hundred, 400-488. The tens digits here go from 0 (400-409) to 8 (480-488). Each tens digit from 0-8 appears 10 times except for 8, which appears 9 times because 480-488 is only 9 numbers. Wait, no, actually, in 400-488, the tens digits are 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), 2 (420-429), 3 (430-439), 4 (440-449), 5 (450-459), 6 (460-469), 7 (470-479), and 8 (480-488). So, each tens digit from 0-7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times (since 480-488 is 9 numbers). Therefore, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the incomplete hundred, and the digit 8 appears 9 times. So, adding to the previous counts, the total for the tens place is: digit 4 appears 40 (from first four hundreds) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50 times. Digit 8 appears 40 (from first four hundreds) + 9 (from 400-488) = 49 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. Each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) has a fixed hundreds digit. For each complete hundred block, the hundreds digit is the same for all 100 numbers. So, in 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1 for 100 numbers. Similarly, 200-299 has 2 for 100 numbers, 300-399 has 3 for 100 numbers, and 400-488 has 4 for 89 numbers (since 400-488 is 89 numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, while digits 1, 2, and 3 each appear 100 times. But since we're only concerned with digits 4 and 8, let's see: digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the highest page number is 488, which is less than 800. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 to the count of 4's and 0 to the count of 8's.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place up to page 480. Then, pages 481-488 add digits 1-8, each once. So, 4 and 8 each get an extra count, making it 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each complete hundred (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place. So, 4 digits each get 10 times in each hundred, so 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, in 400-488, the tens digits go from 0-8, each appearing 10 times except 8, which appears 9 times because 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times. So, total for 4 is 40 + 10 = 50, and for 8 it's 40 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488 is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 4 gets 89, 8 gets 0. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n4: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n8: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nHmm, so the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. But let me think if I made any mistake in counting the units place. Wait, when I calculated units place, I considered pages 1-488. The first page is 1, so units digits go from 1 to 9 in the first block, then 0-9 in each subsequent block. Wait, actually, when considering units digits, the first block (1-9) has units digits 1-9, each appearing once. Then, each subsequent block of 10 (10-19, 20-29, etc.) has digits 0-9 in the units place. So, up to page 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Let me see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once more, and 8 appears once more. So, total units digits: 48*1 +1=49 for 4, and same for 8. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the first block (1-9), units digits are 1-9, so 4 appears once, and 8 appears once. Then, each subsequent block of 10 (10-19, 20-29,...480-489) has 48 blocks, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. But since we're only going up to 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so units digits 0-8. So, in that last block, 4 appears once, and 8 appears once. Therefore, total units digits for 4: 1 (from 1-9) +48 (from 10-480) +1 (from 480-488) =50. Wait, that contradicts my earlier calculation. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recast this.\n\nWait, actually, the first block is 1-9, which has units digits 1-9, so 4 and 8 each appear once. Then, from 10 to 480, there are 48 blocks of 10 (since 480/10=48), each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48*1=48 for each. Then, from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, units digits 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. Therefore, total units digits for 4: 1 +48 +1=50. Similarly, for 8:1 +48 +1=50. Wait, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 50 times. Earlier, I thought it was 49, but that was incorrect. So, I need to correct this.\n\nWait, let me clarify: The total number of pages is 488. The first page is 1, so the units digits go from 1-9 in the first block (1-9). Then, each subsequent block of 10 (10-19, 20-29,...480-489) has units digits 0-9. But since we're only going up to 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, units digits are 0-8. Therefore, in the units place:\n\n- Pages 1-9: 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\n- Pages 10-480: 48 blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48*1=48 for each.\n- Pages 481-488: units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\n\nSo, total units digits for 4:1 +48 +1=50\nTotal units digits for 8:1 +48 +1=50\n\nSo, both 4 and 8 appear 50 times in the units place.\n\nEarlier, I thought it was 49 each, but that was a mistake. So, correcting that, units place contributes 50 each.\n\nNow, moving to the tens place. As before, each complete hundred block contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place. There are four complete hundreds: 0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399. Each contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place, so 40 times each for 4 and 8.\n\nThen, in the incomplete hundred, 400-488, the tens digits go from 0-8. Each tens digit from 0-7 appears 10 times (400-409, 410-419,...,470-479), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total tens digits for 4:40 +10=50\nTotal tens digits for 8:40 +9=49\n\nNow, hundreds place: 400-488 has 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 89 to 4's and 0 to 8's.\n\nAdding it all up:\n\nFor 4:\n- Units:50\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:50+50+89=189\n\nFor 8:\n- Units:50\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:50+49+0=99\n\nDifference:189-99=90\n\nWait, so the difference is 90. But earlier, I thought units place was 50 each, but initially miscalculated. So, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's. But let me check again to make sure.\n\nWait, let's recount units place. Pages 1-9: 4 and 8 each appear once. Pages 10-480: 48 blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in units place, so 48 each. Pages 481-488: units digits 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So, total units digits:1+48+1=50 each. Correct.\n\nTens place: complete hundreds (4 blocks) contribute 40 each. Incomplete hundred (400-488) contributes 10 for 4 and 9 for 8. So, 50 for 4, 49 for 8. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 89 for 4, 0 for 8. Correct.\n\nSo total 4's:50+50+89=189\nTotal 8's:50+49+0=99\nDifference:189-99=90\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Pages 1-9: Each digit 1-9 appears once. So, 4 and 8 each appear once.\n   - Pages 10-480: 48 blocks of 10 pages each. Each digit 0-9 appears once per block in the units place. Thus, 48 times each for 4 and 8.\n   - Pages 481-488: Units digits 1-8. So, 4 and 8 each appear once.\n   - **Total in units place:** 1 + 48 + 1 = 50 for both 4 and 8.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each complete hundred (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place. So, 40 times each for 4 and 8.\n   - Pages 400-488: Tens digits 0-8. Each digit 0-7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n   - **Total in tens place:** 40 + 10 = 50 for 4; 40 + 9 = 49 for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488: Hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. 8 never appears.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89 for 4; 0 for 8.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 50 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 189\n- **8's:** 50 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 99\n\n**Difference:** 189 - 99 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me start by counting the number of 4's.\n\nFirst, let's consider single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. The digit 4 appears once here, on page 4. So, that's one 4. The digit 8 also appears once, on page 8. So, in single-digit pages, both 4 and 8 appear once each. So far, the count is 4:1, 8:1.\n\nNext, let's look at two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Now, two-digit numbers have a tens place and a units place. I should count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nStarting with the tens place: For the tens digit being 4, the numbers are 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, for the tens digit being 8, the numbers are 80-89, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers: The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so from 10-99, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, in each set of ten (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 sets of ten in two-digit numbers (10-99), so that's 9 times for 4. Wait, but actually, from 10-99, there are 90 numbers, so 9 sets of ten. So, 9 times for 4 in the units place. Similarly, for 8, it's also 9 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but wait, from 10-99, the units digit cycles 0-9 nine times. So, 4 appears 9 times in the units place, and 8 appears 9 times as well. So, in two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. Similarly, the total number of 8's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. So, in two-digit pages, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each. So, adding to our previous counts: 4's total now is 1 (single-digit) + 19 = 20. 8's total is 1 + 19 = 20. So, so far, they're equal.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This might be more complicated because there are three places to consider: hundreds, tens, and units. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. In the range 100-488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n\n- For 4: The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n- For 8: The hundreds digit is 8, but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can't be 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all in three-digit page numbers. So, 8's count here is 0.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9, and we need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place across all three-digit page numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nFirst, let's consider how many times each digit appears in the tens place.\n\nFor the hundreds digit, it can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's break it down by each hundreds group.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1 (100-199): The tens digit cycles from 0-9 ten times each (since there are 100 numbers). So, for each hundreds group, each digit in the tens place appears 10 times. So, for 100-199, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2 (200-299): Similarly, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3 (300-399): Same here, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4 (400-488): Now, this is a bit different because it doesn't go up to 499. So, from 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place?\n\nWait, let's think. From 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, but only up to 488. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many numbers are there?\n\n- For tens digits 0-7: Each of these appears 10 times because, for example, 400-409 is 10 numbers, 410-419 is another 10, etc., up to 470-479. So, that's 8 tens digits (0-7), each appearing 10 times. So, 8 * 10 = 80 numbers.\n\n- Then, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nSo, in the hundreds digit 4 group (400-488), the digit 4 in the tens place: Wait, no, we're looking for the digit 4 and 8 in the tens place. So, in the hundreds digit 4 group, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's the same as any other digit except for the last partial group.\n\nWait, actually, in the tens place, for hundreds digit 4, the tens digits go from 0-8. So, 4 appears once in the tens place for each hundreds group. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, in the tens place, for each hundreds group, each digit 0-9 appears equally except possibly the last group if it's cut short.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place across all three-digit numbers from 100-488.\n\nLet me structure it:\n\nTotal three-digit numbers: 488 - 100 + 1 = 389 numbers.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to break it down by hundreds.\n\nFor hundreds digit 1 (100-199): 100 numbers.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit 0-9 appears exactly 10 times. So, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digit 2 (200-299): same, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place.\n\nFor hundreds digit 3 (300-399): same, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4 (400-488): Here, the tens digit goes from 0-8, but the last group (tens digit 8) only goes up to 488, so it's 9 numbers instead of 10.\n\nSo, in the tens place for hundreds digit 4:\n\n- For tens digits 0-7: each appears 10 times (e.g., 400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479). So, 8 digits, each appearing 10 times.\n\n- For tens digit 8: 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, in the tens place for hundreds digit 4:\n\n- 4 appears once in the tens place (when the tens digit is 4), so that's 10 times (from 440-449). Wait, no, wait: when the hundreds digit is 4 and the tens digit is 4, that's 10 numbers: 440-449. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears in the tens place as 480-488, which is 9 times.\n\nWait, but wait, in hundreds digit 4, the tens digit can be 0-8, so for 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds digit 4 group, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nNow, adding up across all hundreds groups:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2: same, 10 each.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3: same, 10 each.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total in the tens place across all three-digit numbers:\n\n4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 times.\n\n8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me check.\n\nWait, in hundreds digits 1,2,3, each contributes 10 for 4 and 10 for 8 in the tens place. So, 3 * 10 = 30 for 4 and 3 * 10 = 30 for 8. Then, in hundreds digit 4, 4 adds 10 for 4 and 9 for 8. So total 4's: 30 +10=40, 8's:30+9=39.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers.\n\nSimilarly, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens and hundreds combination. So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place across all three-digit numbers from 100-488.\n\nAgain, breaking it down by hundreds groups.\n\nFor hundreds digit 1 (100-199):\n\nEach tens group (like 100-109, 110-119, etc.) has 10 numbers, and in each, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, in each tens group, 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once. There are 10 tens groups (0-9), so 4 appears 10 times in the units place, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digit 2 (200-299): same, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the units place.\n\nFor hundreds digit 3 (300-399): same, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4 (400-488):\n\nHere, the tens digits go from 0-8, but the last group (tens digit 8) only goes up to 488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, for each tens group in hundreds digit 4:\n\n- Tens digits 0-7: Each has 10 numbers, so 4 and 8 each appear once per group, so 10 times each.\n\n- Tens digit 8: Only 9 numbers (480-488), so in the units place, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). Wait, but actually, in the units place, each digit from 0-8 appears once, except that 488 is the last, so 8 appears once, but 4 would appear once as well.\n\nWait, let me think again. For the tens digit 8, the numbers are 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the units digits are 0-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, in the units place, 4 appears once, and 8 appears once.\n\nWait, but in the tens digit 8 group, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the units place? Each digit from 0-8 appears once, so 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\n\nSo, for hundreds digit 4, in the units place:\n\n- Tens digits 0-7: 8 groups, each contributing 1 for 4 and 1 for 8, so 8 each.\n\n- Tens digit 8: contributes 1 for 4 and 1 for 8.\n\nSo, total in units place for hundreds digit 4:\n\n4's: 8 + 1 = 9\n\n8's: 8 + 1 = 9\n\nWait, but wait, that doesn't seem right because in each tens group (like 400-409), the units digits are 0-9, so 4 appears once, 8 appears once. So, for 8 tens groups (0-7), each contributing 1 for 4 and 1 for 8, that's 8 each. Then, the last group (tens digit 8) has 9 numbers, but the units digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total in units place for hundreds digit 4:\n\n4's: 8 (from tens 0-7) + 1 (from tens 8) = 9\n\n8's: 8 (from tens 0-7) + 1 (from tens 8) = 9\n\nWait, but that's only 9 each, but let me check: from 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIt would be in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times, right? Because from 400-488, every 10 numbers, the units digit 4 appears once, except that 488 is the last, so 484 is included, making it 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears in 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's also 9 times.\n\nSo, yes, 9 each.\n\nTherefore, in the units place across all three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: each contribute 10 for 4 and 10 for 8, so 3 *10=30 each.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: contributes 9 for 4 and 9 for 8.\n\nSo, total units place:\n\n4's: 30 + 9 = 39\n\n8's: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nWait, but wait, that's 39 each? But earlier, in the tens place, we had 40 for 4's and 39 for 8's. So, adding up, in three-digit numbers:\n\n4's: tens place (40) + units place (39) = 79\n\n8's: tens place (39) + units place (39) = 78\n\nWait, but let me confirm. For three-digit numbers:\n\n- Tens place: 4's = 40, 8's = 39\n\n- Units place: 4's = 39, 8's = 39\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 40 + 39 = 79\n\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 39 + 39 = 78\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the digits:\n\nFirst, single-digit pages:\n\n4's: 1\n\n8's:1\n\nTwo-digit pages:\n\n4's:19\n\n8's:19\n\nThree-digit pages:\n\n4's:79\n\n8's:78\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 +79 = 99\n\nTotal 8's:1 +19 +78 =98\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 99, and the number of 8's is 98. So, 99 - 98 =1.\n\nWait, but that seems too close. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place for three-digit numbers, I had 4's appearing 89 times in the hundreds place, right? Because from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4, so 89 times. But I think I didn't include that in my earlier counts. Oh no! Wait, I think I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, I only considered the hundreds digit, but in my earlier breakdown, I didn't add that to the total 4's. Let me go back.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 times. So, that's additional 89 4's.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I was calculating the tens and units places, I didn't include the hundreds place. So, I think I missed that part.\n\nWait, let me correct that.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4's appear 89 times (from 400-488), and 8's appear 0 times because there's no 800-899 in a 488-page book.\n\n- Tens place: 4's appear 40 times, 8's appear 39 times.\n\n- Units place: 4's appear 39 times, 8's appear 39 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units) = 89 + 40 = 129 +39=168\n\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 0 (hundreds) +39 (tens) +39 (units) =78\n\nWait, that's a big difference. So, I think I missed the hundreds place earlier, which is a significant count.\n\nSo, let me recalculate everything.\n\nStarting over, considering hundreds, tens, and units places:\n\nSingle-digit pages (1-9):\n\n4's:1\n\n8's:1\n\nTwo-digit pages (10-99):\n\nTens place:\n\n4's:10 (40-49)\n\n8's:10 (80-89)\n\nUnits place:\n\n4's:9 (14,24,...,94)\n\n8's:9 (18,28,...,98)\n\nSo, total two-digit:\n\n4's:10+9=19\n\n8's:10+9=19\n\nThree-digit pages (100-488):\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's:89 (400-488)\n\n8's:0\n\nTens place:\n\n4's: in each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488):\n\n- For 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each contributes 10 4's in tens place (e.g., 140-149, etc.)\n\n- For 400-488: tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 3*10 +10=40\n\nSimilarly, 8's in tens place:\n\n- For 100-199, etc.: each contributes 10 8's (e.g., 180-189)\n\n- For 400-488: tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place:3*10 +9=39\n\nUnits place:\n\n4's:\n\n- For each hundreds group (100-199, etc.), each contributes 10 4's in units place (e.g., 104,114,...,194)\n\n- For 400-488: units digit 4 appears 9 times (404,414,...,484)\n\nSo, total 4's in units place:3*10 +9=39\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place:\n\n- For each hundreds group:10 8's\n\n- For 400-488:9 8's (408,418,...,488)\n\nSo, total 8's in units place:3*10 +9=39\n\nSo, three-digit numbers:\n\n4's: hundreds (89) + tens (40) + units (39) = 89+40=129+39=168\n\n8's: hundreds (0) + tens (39) + units (39)=78\n\nNow, total 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168)=1+19=20+168=188\n\nTotal 8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78)=1+19=20+78=98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that's a big difference. So, earlier, I had missed the hundreds place, which added 89 more 4's, making the total 4's much higher.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me double-check the calculations to make sure.\n\nSingle-digit:\n\n4's:1\n\n8's:1\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n4's:19\n\n8's:19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n4's:168\n\n8's:78\n\nTotal 4's:1+19+168=188\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Single-Digit Pages (1-9):**\n   - '4' appears once (page 4).\n   - '8' appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-Digit Pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - '4' appears 10 times (40-49).\n     - '8' appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - '4' appears 9 times (14, 24, ..., 94).\n     - '8' appears 9 times (18, 28, ..., 98).\n   - **Total for Two-Digit Pages:**\n     - '4': 10 + 9 = 19.\n     - '8': 10 + 9 = 19.\n\n3. **Three-Digit Pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - '4' appears 89 times (400-488).\n     - '8' does not appear.\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - '4' appears 40 times (10 times in each hundreds group 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 10 times in 400-449).\n     - '8' appears 39 times (10 times in each of the first three hundreds groups, and 9 times in 480-488).\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - '4' appears 39 times (10 times in each of the first three hundreds groups, and 9 times in 400-488).\n     - '8' appears 39 times (similarly).\n   - **Total for Three-Digit Pages:**\n     - '4': 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n     - '8': 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **'4'**: 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n   - **'8'**: 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe digit '4' is printed 90 times more than the digit '8'.  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by counting the number of 4's in each position.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, we'll take 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 fours. But wait, from 1 to 488, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 pages, so actually, the 48th set ends at 480, and then we have 481-488. So, in the units place, the 4's occur at 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. How many is that? Let's see, from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that's different from my initial thought. So actually, there are 49 fours in the units place. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, and then in the partial cycle from 481-488, the units digit is 1-8, so no additional 4. Wait, but 480 is included, which is the 48th set, so 480 has a units digit of 0, so the 4 in the units place occurs at 484, which is within the 480-489 range. So actually, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 (from 1-480) plus one more at 484, making it 49. Wait, but 480 is the 48th set, so 480 is the last number of the 48th set, so the 48th set would include 480, but the 4 in the units place occurs at 484, which is within the 480-489 range. So, yes, 49 fours in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 pages. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, etc. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds. In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages, so 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 fours in the tens place. But wait, we have 488 pages, which is less than 500. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for pages 400-409, 410-419, etc., but actually, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, and 440-449. Wait, that's 5 sets of 10 pages where the tens digit is 4. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 400-409 is one set, 410-419 is another, but the tens digit is 4 only when the tens place is 4, so in 400-409, the tens digit is 0, so that's not correct. Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: The tens digit is 4 when the number is in the range x40 to x49, where x can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, in 0-99, it's 40-49; in 100-199, it's 140-149; in 200-299, it's 240-249; in 300-399, it's 340-349; and in 400-488, it's 440-449. So that's five sets of 10 pages each where the tens digit is 4. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 5 sets, 10 pages each, so 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 49 fours, tens place: 50 fours, hundreds place: 89 fours. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I think I should do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with units place: For every 10 pages, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many 8's in the units place? Similar to the 4's, but let's see. From 1-488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, and then in the partial cycle, 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 8 appears once more at 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 pages. So, in 0-99, it's 80-89; in 100-199, it's 180-189; in 200-299, it's 280-289; in 300-399, it's 380-389; and in 400-488, it's 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many sets do we have? Let's see, in each hundred, except the last one, we have a full set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, in 0-399, that's four hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours: 188, total eights: 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units: 49. Let me recount: from 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens: 50. From 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's five sets, each contributing 10 fours. So 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: 89. From 400-488, inclusive. 488-400+1=89. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units: 49. From 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens: 49. From 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's five sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal eights: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90 more fours.\n\nI think that's the answer. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149).\n   - There are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - This is 89 numbers.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189).\n   - There are 4 full blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and a partial block (480-488).\n   - Full blocks contribute 40, and the partial block contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = **90**\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

For each position, I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's and then sum them up across all positions. \n\nStarting with the units place: For each complete set of ten pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for 8. Now, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete sets of ten and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). \n\nIn each complete set of ten, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 sets, that would be 48 4's and 48 8's. Now, looking at the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding these, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal. \n\nNext, moving to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for pages 40-49, which is 10 times, and similarly for 8 in 80-89. \n\nSince the book has 488 pages, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49), and the same for 8 (80-89). So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 4's and 40 8's. \n\nNow, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Wait, 401-488 is 88 pages, so the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Let's see, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place in 480-488, which is 9 pages because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 pages. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). \n\nTherefore, in the tens place, the total number of 4's is 40 (from the four hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50, and the total number of 8's is 40 (from the four hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49. \n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because when considering the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8, but each full ten within that would contribute 10 times. So, 401-488 is 88 pages, which is 8 full tens (401-410, 411-420, ..., 481-490, but since it's only up to 488, the last ten is 481-488, which is 8 pages). So, in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 8 appears 8 times, except for 8, which appears 9 times because 481-488 is 8 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so it's 9 pages? Wait, no, 480-489 is 10 pages, but we only go up to 488, so it's 9 pages, meaning the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in 480-488. \n\nWait, but in the 401-488 range, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? From 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 times. So, in the tens place, 4's are 10 and 8's are 9 in this range. Therefore, adding to the previous 40 each, the total for 4's is 40 + 10 = 50, and for 8's, it's 40 + 9 = 49. \n\nSo, in the tens place, there are 50 4's and 49 8's. \n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Therefore, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. \n\nSo, for the hundreds place, 4's: 89, 8's: 0. \n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each place. \n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n- Each set of 10 has one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8, so 48 each.\n- The remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n- So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n- 4 hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10 = 40 each.\n- The remaining 88 pages (401-488) have tens digits from 0 to 8.\n- In this range, 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (440-449).\n- 8 appears in the tens place 9 times (480-488).\n- So, total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. That looks correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n- 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Determine the range of page numbers:** Pages 1 to 488.\n\n2. **Count occurrences of digit 4 and 8 in each digit position (units, tens, hundreds):**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Each set of 10 pages (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) has one 4 and one 8.\n     - Total complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 sets.\n     - 48 sets contribute 48 each of 4's and 8's.\n     - Remaining 8 pages (481-488) contribute one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n     - Total units place: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n     - 4 hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 each.\n     - Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n       - 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n       - 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n     - Total tens place: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n     - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n     - Total hundreds place: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\n3. **Sum the counts:**\n   - Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n4. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.  \n\\boxed{90}"
