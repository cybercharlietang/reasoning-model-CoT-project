    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each place value separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, for the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and a partial set of 8 numbers (481-488). Each complete set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the partial set, 484 is the only number with a 4 in the units place. So, units place 4's total to 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers at a time. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's see how many such sets there are. From 1-99, there's one set (40-49). From 100-199, another set (140-149). Similarly, 200-299 has 240-249, and 300-399 has 340-349. Then, 400-488 has 440-449. So, that's five sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, in the last set (440-449), does it go up to 449? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, in every set of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? 48 complete sets, as before, plus a partial set of 8 numbers. Each complete set gives one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then, in the partial set (481-488), 488 is the only number with an 8 in the units place. So, units place 8's total to 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers at a time, such as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such sets there are. From 1-99, one set (80-89). From 100-199, another set (180-189). Similarly, 200-299 has 280-289, and 300-399 has 380-389. Now, does 400-488 have any numbers with 8 in the tens place? 480-489 would be the next set, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488. So, that's another set, but only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-489 is ten numbers, but we only have up to 488, so it's 9 numbers. Hmm, so does that count as a full set? I think not, because a full set is ten numbers. So, only the first four sets are complete, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40. Plus, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1-399, we have four complete sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each giving 10 8's in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 more. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. In 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, in the tens place, we have 40 (from 1-399) + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 188 - 98 = 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nCounting 4's:\n- Units place: 48 sets of 10 (1-480) give 48 4's. Then, 484 is the 49th. So, 49.\n- Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nCounting 8's:\n- Units place: 48 sets of 10 (1-480) give 48 8's. Then, 488 adds 1 more, so 49.\n- Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4\u00d710=40 + 9=49.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Count the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units place:** In every 10 numbers, '4' appears once. There are 48 complete sets of 10 (1-480), contributing 48 '4's. The 484th page adds 1 more, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens place:** '4' appears in the tens place for 10 numbers each in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, totaling 50 '4's.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, there are 89 '4's.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Count the number of '8's:**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to '4's, '8' appears 48 times in 1-480, plus once in 488, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens place:** '8' appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488 (9 numbers). This gives 40 + 9 = 49 '8's.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No '8's as pages go up to 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's - Number of '8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4). From 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. So, I can calculate how many such groups there are in 488 pages. \n\nWait, but maybe it's better to think of it as how many times each digit appears in each position. So, for the units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear? Well, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, the total number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, that would give us 48 times. But actually, from 1 to 488, the last group is 481-488, which is only 8 numbers, so the 48th group ends at 480. So, the units digit 4 appears 48 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of times 4 is in the units digit. So, starting from 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many terms are there in this sequence? The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, so that's 49 times. Hmm, so maybe my initial thought was wrong because I didn't account for the last term correctly. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since 484 is the last term where 4 appears in the units place, that's 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4, plus the 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, let me make sure. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then 14, 24,..., 484. So, the sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place: How many times does 4 appear in the tens digit? For example, from 40-49, that's 10 times. Then from 140-149, another 10 times, and so on. So, let's see how many such groups there are.\n\nThe page numbers go up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), 4 (400-488). So, for the tens place, 4 can appear in the 40-49 range, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. Let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nEach of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences, except possibly the last one if it's cut off. But in this case, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, how many such ranges are there? From 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, that's 5 groups, each with 10, so 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place: How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds digit? That's from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I need to count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see: The numbers are 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488 if 488 ends with 8. Wait, 488 ends with 8, so the last number is 488. So, the sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The first term is 8, the last term is 488, common difference 10. So, number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\nNow, tens place: How many times does 8 appear in the tens digit? That would be in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers. So, let's count each range:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times 8 in the tens place.\n- 180-189: 10 times.\n- 280-289: 10 times.\n- 380-389: 10 times.\n- 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, hundreds place: How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds digit? The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 times.\n\nWait, so 4's appear 188 times and 8's appear 98 times. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me check the tens place for 4's again. I had 5 groups: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each group contributes 10, so 5*10=50. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four groups are 10 each, and the last one is 9, so 10+10+10+10+9=49. That also seems correct.\n\nUnits place for both digits: 49 each, which makes sense because from 1 to 488, each digit (4 and 8) appears 49 times in the units place. Wait, but earlier I thought 4's units place was 49, and 8's units place was also 49, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the hundreds place for 4's: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times. That's correct because 488 - 400 +1 = 89.\n\nAnd for 8's, hundreds place is 0 because the book doesn't go beyond 488.\n\nSo, the total counts are correct, and the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. From 1 to 488, this happens 49 times (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens Place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, 4 appears 89 times.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** Similarly, 8 appears 49 times (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens Place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit within 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**\nThere are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of ten consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. How many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of ten and then an extra 8 pages. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times from the full groups. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, from 101-200, the tens digit is 4 in 140-149, again 10 times. This pattern continues. How many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an extra 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each of the 4 full hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, adding that, the total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. How many numbers are there here? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, 89 times.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 499, but since the book ends at 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 times. So, total 4's in the hundreds place are 89.\n\nWait, but 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, so adding 1 gives 89. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is the sum of 4's in units, tens, and hundreds places. That would be 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4, for every group of ten, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups and 8 extra pages. So, 48 times from the full groups. In the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears once. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The tens digit is 8 in groups like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each of these groups has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full hundreds. In each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 times here. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds place contributes 0 times.\n\nTherefore, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0, so 49 + 49 is 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the tens place. I had 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That seems right.\n\nAnd in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's there. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That's correct.\n\nFor the 8's, units place: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the extra 8 in 481-488, so 49. Tens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40, plus in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 40 + 9 = 49. So, total 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought, in the hundreds place for 8's, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so that's 0. So, yes, 98 total 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can list some numbers and see if the counts make sense.\n\nFor example, in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear? Every 10 numbers, once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times, plus the 4 in 484, which is the 49th. So, 49 times. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, every 100 numbers, 10 times. So, 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 times 10 = 40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nAnd hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's there. So, total 49 + 49 + 89 = 187? Wait, no, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Wait, earlier I thought units was 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, so 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the 8's, units place is 49, tens place is 49, so total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I just thought, in the hundreds place for 4's, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's. But in the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 contributes 10, and the hundreds digit contributes 89. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\n- Units place: floor(488/10) = 48, plus if the last digit is >=4, which it is, so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, the formula is a bit different. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor(n/10) + min(1, (n % 10 >= d)).\n\nWait, maybe I should use a formula to calculate it more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit place, the count can be calculated as:\n\nFor units place:\ncount = (n // 10) * 1 + min(1, n % 10 >= 4)\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\ncount = (n // 100) * 10 + min(10, (n % 100) >= 40)\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a more systematic approach.\n\nLet me try to compute the number of 4's in each digit place:\n\nUnits place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms? The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumbers where the tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n\nEach of these blocks has 10 numbers. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, 5 blocks. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, yes, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in the hundreds place, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumbers where the hundreds digit is 4: 400-488. How many numbers? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumbers ending with 8: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n\nEach of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumbers where the hundreds digit is 8: 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are 0 such numbers.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the hundreds place for 4's was 89, which seems correct because 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** Every 10 numbers, '4' appears once. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of ten and an extra 8 pages. Thus, '4' appears 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** Every 100 numbers, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds, contributing 40 times. In the range 401-488, '4' appears in 440-449, adding 10 times. Total: 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, '4' appears in the hundreds place for 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to '4', '8' appears 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** '8' appears 10 times in each of the first four hundreds and 9 times in the last partial hundred (480-488), totaling 49 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - Subtract the number of '8's from '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: In the units place, the digits cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks and then a partial block from 481 to 488. In each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the partial block from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the 4 in the units place appears once more (484). So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 instances where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks. Each block gives 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, I should check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, in 488 pages, there are 48 full blocks of 10 and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). Each full block contributes one 8, so 48 times. In the partial block, the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 in the tens place appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Each full block (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's count the blocks: 80-89 is one, 180-189 is another, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, for the first four blocks, each contributes 10 8's: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. The last block, 480-488, has the tens digit as 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, total in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check the tens place for 8's. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in tens place: 10. Then 180-189: another 10, so 20. 280-289: another 10, total 30. 380-389: another 10, total 40. Then 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), each with 8 in the tens place, so 9 more. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I was counting 4's in the hundreds place, I had 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. For 8's, the hundreds place is zero because 800 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nNow, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full blocks (each 10 pages) give 48 4's. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), units digit 4 appears once (484). So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems right.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That checks out.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full blocks, 48 8's, plus 488, which is one more, so 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10\u00d74 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, since 800 is beyond 488. So, 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. \n\nWait, but I feel like that might be high. Let me think again. Maybe I overcounted somewhere.\n\nWait, when I counted the hundreds place for 4's, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 is correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, 4 blocks of 10 and one of 9: 4\u00d710 +9=49. That's correct.\n\nUnits place for both digits: 48 full blocks of 10, and then the last partial block contributing 1 more for 4 and 1 more for 8. So, 49 each, correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. In 488 pages, there are 48 full decades (480 pages) and a partial decade (481-488). Each full decade contributes 1 '4', totaling 48. The partial decade adds 1 more, making 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each block of 100 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149). There are 5 such blocks, contributing 10 '4's each, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, contributing 89 '4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. With 48 full decades and a partial, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full blocks contributing 10 each (40) and a partial block (480-488) contributing 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place within 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering the single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears once (page 4), and the digit 8 appears once (page 8). So, so far, 4's are tied with 8's at 1 each.\n\nNext, I'll look at the two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each two-digit number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place separately.\n\nStarting with the tens place for two-digit numbers: the tens digit can be 1 through 9. When the tens digit is 4, the numbers are 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 80-89, which is another 10 numbers, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers: the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each tens digit. So, for each tens digit (1-9), the digit 4 will appear once in the units place. There are 9 tens digits, so that's 9 times for 4. Similarly, the digit 8 will appear once in the units place for each tens digit, so 9 times for 8 as well.\n\nWait, but actually, from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers, so each digit from 0-9 appears 9 times in the units place. So, 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times in the units place for two-digit numbers.\n\nAdding up the two-digit numbers: 4's in tens place (10) + 4's in units place (9) = 19. Similarly, 8's in tens place (10) + 8's in units place (9) = 19. So, in two-digit numbers, 4's and 8's both appear 19 times each.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because when I add the single-digit and two-digit counts, the total would be 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) = 20 for both 4's and 8's, which seems high. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no, actually, the single-digit counts are separate from the two-digit counts. So, for single-digit, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. For two-digit numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place and 9 times in the units place, totaling 19. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place and 9 times in the units place, totaling 19. So, combining single and two-digit, 4's total is 1 + 19 = 20, and 8's total is 1 + 19 = 20. So, they are equal so far.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Here, each page number has a hundreds place, a tens place, and a units place. I'll need to calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each of these places.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, for hundreds digit 1, the range is 100-199. For hundreds digit 2, it's 200-299, and so on up to 400-488.\n\nFirst, let's count how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's only when the hundreds digit is 4, which is from 400 to 488. The number of pages here is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, how about 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9, and the hundreds digit is 1-4. So, for each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each, except for the last group, 400-488, which might not complete the cycle.\n\nWait, actually, for each hundreds group from 100-199, 200-299, and 300-399, the tens digit goes from 0-9 for each ten numbers. So, in each of these groups, the digit 4 in the tens place occurs 10 times (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). Similarly, the digit 8 in the tens place occurs 10 times in each group (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).\n\nHowever, the last group is 400-488, which only goes up to 488. So, the tens digit here can go from 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, and the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers).\n\nSo, let's calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place across all three-digit numbers.\n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (140-149, etc.), so 3 groups \u00d7 10 = 30 times for 4. Similarly, each group has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place, so 30 times for 8.\n\nNow, for the hundreds digit 4 (400-488): 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times in the tens place (480-488).\n\nSo, total for tens place: 4's = 30 + 10 = 40, and 8's = 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, no. Wait, actually, the hundreds digits 1,2,3 each have 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place, so that's 3\u00d710=30 for both 4 and 8. Then, in the hundreds digit 4, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total 4's in tens place: 30 +10=40, and 8's:30+9=39.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. The units digit cycles from 0-9 for each combination of hundreds and tens digits.\n\nFor each hundreds group (100-199, etc.), and for each tens digit (0-9), the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, for each hundreds group, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the units place. So, for each group, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the units place, and the digit 8 appears 10 times as well.\n\nBut wait, for the last group, 400-488, the units digit doesn't go all the way to 9 when the tens digit is 8. Let me check that.\n\nWait, in the hundreds group 400-488, the tens digits go from 0-8, as 488 is the last page. So, for each tens digit from 0-7, the units digit goes from 0-9, so 4 appears 10 times for each tens digit (e.g., 400-409: 404; 410-419: 414, etc.). But when the tens digit is 8, the units digits go from 0-8, so 488 is included, but 489 isn't. So, in the tens digit 8, the units digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once in 484 and 8 appears once in 488.\n\nWait, let me clarify. For each hundreds group except the last one (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each tens digit (0-9) has 10 numbers, so the units digit cycles 0-9, giving 10 occurrences of each digit, including 4 and 8.\n\nIn the hundreds group 400-488, the tens digits go from 0-8. For tens digits 0-7, each has 10 units digits (0-9), so 4 appears 10 times in each of these tens digits, and 8 appears 10 times as well. But for tens digit 8, the units digits only go up to 8, so 488 is included, but 489 is not. So, in tens digit 8, the units digits are 0-8, which is 9 numbers. So, in the units place, for 480-488, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo, let's calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in the units place across all three-digit numbers.\n\nFor hundreds groups 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: Each has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the units place per hundreds group. Since there are 3 such groups, that's 3\u00d710=30 for 4 and 3\u00d710=30 for 8.\n\nNow, for the hundreds group 400-488:\n\n- For tens digits 0-7: Each has 10 units digits, so 4 appears 10 times per tens digit, and 8 appears 10 times as well. So, 8 tens digits \u00d710=80 for both 4 and 8.\n\n- For tens digit 8: Units digits 0-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo, total for 400-488 in units place: 4's = 8\u00d710 +1=81, and 8's=8\u00d710 +1=81.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 400-488 is only 89 pages, so the units digits can't have 81 occurrences. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, in the units place, for each tens digit, we have 10 units digits, so for each tens digit, 4 appears once in the units place, regardless of how many numbers are in that tens group. Wait, no, actually, for each tens digit, the units digit cycles 0-9, so for each tens digit, 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once as well. So, for tens digits 0-7, each contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 8 tens digits \u00d71 occurrence each = 8 for 4 and 8 each. Then, for tens digit 8, units digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total for 400-488 in units place: 4's=8+1=9, and 8's=8+1=9.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, in the hundreds group 400-488, in the units place, 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, adding up all three-digit numbers:\n\n- Units place for 400-399: 3 groups \u00d710=30 for 4, 30 for 8.\n- Units place for 400-488: 9 for 4, 9 for 8.\nTotal units place: 30+9=39 for 4, 30+9=39 for 8.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 81, which was wrong. So, correcting that, the units place in three-digit numbers contributes 39 each for 4 and 8.\n\nWait, let me make sure. For hundreds groups 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the units place. So, 3\u00d710=30 each.\n\nFor 400-488: For each tens digit from 0-7, the units digits 0-9 include one 4 and one 8. So, 8 tens digits \u00d71=8 for 4 and 8. Then, for tens digit 8, units digits 0-8 include 484 (one 4) and 488 (one 8). So, total for 400-488: 8+1=9 for 4, and 8+1=9 for 8.\n\nSo, total units place in three-digit numbers: 30+9=39 for 4, and 30+9=39 for 8.\n\nWait, that seems correct now.\n\nSo, summarizing three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n- Units place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nWait, let me check the tens place again. Earlier, I thought that in the hundreds groups 1-3, each contributes 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the tens place, so 3\u00d710=30 each. Then, in the hundreds group 4, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total for tens place: 30+10=40 for 4, and 30+9=39 for 8.\n\nSo, yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, adding up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: hundreds (89) + tens (40) + units (39) = 89+40=129+39=168\nTotal 4's: 1+19+168=188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: hundreds (0) + tens (39) + units (39) = 0+39+39=78\nTotal 8's: 1+19+78=98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, single-digit:\n\n- 4 appears once (page 4)\n- 8 appears once (page 8)\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place: 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89)\n- Units place: 4 appears 9 times (14,24,...,94), 8 appears 9 times (18,28,...,98)\nTotal two-digit: 10+9=19 for 4, 10+9=19 for 8\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40 times (30 in 100-399, 10 in 400-488), 8 appears 39 times (30 in 100-399, 9 in 400-488)\n- Units place: 4 appears 39 times (30 in 100-399, 9 in 400-488), 8 appears 39 times (30 in 100-399, 9 in 400-488)\nTotal three-digit for 4: 89+40+39=168\nTotal three-digit for 8: 0+39+39=78\n\nAdding up all:\n\n4's: 1 (single) +19 (two-digit) +168 (three-digit) = 188\n8's: 1 (single) +19 (two-digit) +78 (three-digit) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each digit position for both 4 and 8 and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor the units digit, in every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, the digit 4 appears once in every 10 numbers, and the same goes for 8. \n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). \n\nIn each complete block, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the same for 8's. \n\nNow, looking at the partial block from 481-488. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, both 4 and 8 appear once in this partial block. \n\nAdding them up, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, the total number of 8's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both digits appear the same number of times.\n\nNext, moving on to the tens place:\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every block of 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), ..., up to 9 (90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each 100 numbers.\n\nSo, how many complete blocks of 100 are in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49 in the first block, 140-149 in the second, etc.), and the same goes for 8. So, for 4 blocks, the number of 4's in the tens place is 4 * 10 = 40, and the same for 8's.\n\nNow, looking at the partial block from 401-488. The tens digits here go from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 480-488). So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place from 440-449, which is 10 times. The digit 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 times (since 488 is the last page). \n\nWait, no, actually, let me correct that. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so 9 times. \n\nTherefore, in the partial block, 4's in the tens place: 10, and 8's in the tens place: 9.\n\nAdding up the complete blocks and the partial block:\n\nTotal 4's in tens place: 40 (from complete blocks) + 10 (from partial) = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 (from complete blocks) + 9 (from partial) = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. That means there's one more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place:\n\nIn the hundreds place, the digit appears only in three-digit numbers. The hundreds digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0 (since they are two-digit numbers), but starting from 100, the hundreds digit becomes 1, then 2, and so on.\n\nIn our case, the book has 488 pages, so the hundreds digit goes from 1 (for 100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488).\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nThe digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place because the highest page number is 488, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's:\n\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- Each block of 10 has one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1 to both 4 and 8.\n- Then, the partial block from 481-488: units digits are 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once.\n- So, total units: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each block of 100 has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n- 4 blocks of 100 (1-400) contribute 4*10 = 40 each for 4 and 8.\n- Partial block 401-488:\n  - For 4: 440-449, which is 10 times.\n  - For 8: 480-488, which is 9 times.\n- So, total tens place:\n  - 4: 40 + 10 = 50\n  - 8: 40 + 9 = 49\nThat seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 4's in hundreds place.\n- 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place, so 0.\nThat's correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: Each digit in the hundreds place from 1 to 4. So, 1 appears 100 times (100-199), 2 appears 100 times (200-299), 3 appears 100 times (300-399), and 4 appears 89 times (400-488). So, yes, 89 is correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. When considering the tens place in the partial block, I might have made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nIn the partial block 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. That's correct. For the digit 8 in the tens place, it occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 9 times. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I add up the 4's and 8's in the tens place, I get 50 and 49 respectively. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to check: Let's calculate the total number of digits printed. But maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, I can think about how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nWait, another approach: For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- Total numbers: 488.\n- Each digit 0-9 appears floor(488/10) = 48 times, with a remainder of 8. So, for digits 0-8, they appear 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 9 appears 48 times because the remainder is 8, so 9 doesn't get an extra. Wait, no, actually, the remainder is 8, so digits 0-8 each get one more occurrence, and 9 doesn't. So, in the units place, digits 0-8 appear 49 times, and 9 appears 48 times. So, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place. That's correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each digit appears 10 times per 100 numbers. So, total number of 100s is 4 (1-400), so 4*10 = 40 times each. Then, the partial block from 401-488: 88 numbers. So, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place here?\n\nThe tens digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears once, except for 8, which appears only partially because 488 is the last page.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which appears 9 times because we stop at 488.\n\nWait, let me think again. From 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 numbers.\n\n411-420: tens digit 1, 10 numbers.\n\n...\n\n471-480: tens digit 7, 10 numbers.\n\n481-490: tens digit 8, but we only go up to 488, so that's 8 numbers: 481-488.\n\nWait, no, 481-490 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, we have 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in the units place? Wait, no, in the tens place, it's 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, for the partial block 401-488:\n\n- Digit 4 in tens place: 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n- Digit 8 in tens place: 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n- All other digits from 0-3 and 5-7 appear 10 times each.\n\nSo, in the tens place, total for 4: 40 (from complete blocks) +10=50.\n\nFor 8: 40 +9=49.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- From 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's.\n- From 100-199: hundreds digit 1, so no 4's or 8's.\n- From 200-299: hundreds digit 2, so no 4's or 8's.\n- From 300-399: hundreds digit 3, so no 4's or 8's.\n- From 400-488: hundreds digit 4, so 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 89 4's, 0 8's.\n\nAdding up all the digits:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total blocks of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers.\n   - 4 and 8 each appear 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - 4 complete blocks (1-400) contribute 40 each for 4 and 8.\n   - Partial block (401-488): 4 appears 10 times (440-449), 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total: 4's = 50, 8's = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 4's = 89, 8's = 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: In the numbers 1 to 488, how often does 4 appear in the units digit? Well, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, for every block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10, and then an additional 8 numbers (481-488). In each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial block, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484). So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, in the tens digit, 4 appears in blocks of 100. For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Then, this pattern repeats every 100 numbers. So, how many such blocks are there in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial block from 401-488. In each full block, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49). So, 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 times. Now, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 440-449, which is another 10 times. Wait, but 488 is less than 490, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, right? Because 440 is 440 and 449 is 449, which is less than 488. So, that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. Therefore, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, hold on, let me check that. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? It's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's printed are 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 48 full decades (1-480) with 48 \u00d7 1 = 48, plus 484, so 49. Tens place: 4 full centuries (1-400) with 4 \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 440-449, which is another 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: How many times does 8 appear in the units digit from 1 to 488? Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48 \u00d7 1 = 48. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: Now, 8 in the tens digit appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block of 100 has one such block where the tens digit is 8, contributing 10 instances. So, how many full centuries are there in 488? 4 full centuries (1-400). So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial century (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-489. But since our upper limit is 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. Therefore, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me make sure. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 times. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 to the count of 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Units: 48 full decades, 48 \u00d7 1 = 48, plus 488, so 49. Tens: 4 full centuries, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 480-488, which is 9, so 49. Hundreds: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, 188 - 98 is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nLet me just go through once more to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nCounting 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nCounting 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I think I did it right.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of ten numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once every ten numbers. Now, for 4's in the units place, how many times does that happen? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. The number of complete groups of ten is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups). In each group of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, that's 48 times. But wait, the last group is from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers. The units digits here are 1 through 8, so 4 appears once more in 484. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, each group of ten has one 8. So, 48 groups give 48 times. The last partial group (481-488) has an 8 in 488, so that's one more. So, total 8's in units place are 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but that seems like 4's and 8's in the units place are the same. Hmm, maybe I need to check that again. Let me recount. For 4's: from 1 to 480, there are 48 groups of ten, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go 1-8, so 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, for 8's: 48 groups of ten give 48, and then 488 is the 8 in the units place, so 48 + 1 = 49. So, yes, both have 49 in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, in 0-99, the tens digit is 0 for 0-9, 1 for 10-19, and so on up to 9 for 90-99, each appearing 10 times.\n\nSo, for the digit 4 in the tens place, each hundred has 10 occurrences. How many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88. So, from 1-400, there are 4 full hundreds. Wait, actually, 1-100 is the first hundred, 101-200 the second, and so on up to 401-500, but since we only go up to 488, the last hundred is incomplete.\n\nWait, actually, page numbers start at 1, so the hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-500. But since the book ends at 488, the last hundred is 401-488, which is 88 numbers. So, in each full hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, for 400 pages, that would be 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40. But wait, we only go up to 488, which is 488 pages. Wait, actually, the hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-500. But since we're only going up to 488, the last hundred is 401-488, which is 88 pages. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear?\n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, in the first four hundreds (1-400), the digit 4 appears 4*10=40 times in the tens place. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. How many numbers are there from 440-449? That's 10 numbers, but wait, does 449 exist? The last page is 488, so 449 is within that. So, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times in 440-449. So, total for the tens place, 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place. Each full hundred has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for the first four hundreds, that's 4*10=40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. Wait, no, actually, 480-489 would be the tens digit 8, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred. So, total 8's in the tens place would be 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., 8 for 480-488. So, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 times. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. So, 4 is ahead by 1 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, 4 for 400-488. Wait, so the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's 89 times, from 400 to 488. \n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, 4 is ahead by 89 here.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations, especially in the tens and hundreds places.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 49 for both 4 and 8. In the tens place, 4 had 50, 8 had 49. In the hundreds place, 4 had 89, 8 had 0.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n8's total: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That seems right.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's, I had 50, which includes the full hundreds and the last partial hundred. For 8's, 49, which includes 40 from full hundreds and 9 from the last partial. That adds up.\n\nUnits place: both 49, so no difference there.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each group of ten numbers contributes one 4. There are 48 full groups (480 numbers) and one partial group (481-488) with 484. Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, each group of ten contributes one 8. Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each hundred contributes ten 4's in the tens place. Four full hundreds (1-400) contribute 4\u00d710=40. The last partial hundred (401-488) includes 440-449, contributing 10. Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - **8's:** Each hundred contributes ten 8's. Four full hundreds contribute 40. The last partial hundred includes 480-488, contributing 9. Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** Pages 400-488 contribute 89 occurrences of 4.\n   - **8's:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

For each position, I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For each complete set of ten numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once as well. \n\nNow, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and an additional 8 pages (481-488). \n\nSo, for each complete set of ten, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. Therefore, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the same for 8's. But wait, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial set, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). \n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 (from complete sets) + 1 (from the partial set) = 49. Similarly, the number of 8's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, the count of 4's and 8's is the same.\n\nNext, I'll move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). In each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (40-49), so that's 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (80-89). \n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred from 401-488. \n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and so does the digit 8. So, for 4 complete hundreds, the number of 4's in the tens place is 4 * 10 = 40, and the same for 8's. \n\nNow, looking at the partial hundred from 401-488. The tens digit here cycles through 0-8. So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (440-449), but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (480-489), but since our book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the partial hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the digit 8 appears 9 times. \n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from partial hundred) = 50. The number of 8's in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. \n\nSo, in the tens place, there are 50 4's and 49 8's. That means there's one more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for three-digit numbers, which start at 100. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds digit 4. It appears in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case. Since 8 is higher than 4, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 in the page numbers up to 488. So, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0. \n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89, and the number of 8's is 0. \n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each digit place.\n\nFor the 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor the 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's are printed than 8's, we subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place: 48 complete sets of ten, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens digit. 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40 for each. Then, the partial hundred from 401-488: the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, 40 +10=50 for 4's, and 40 +9=49 for 8's. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's.\n\nAdding up: 49+50+89=188 for 4's, and 49+49+0=98 for 8's. 188-98=90. \n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of ten numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 48 complete sets (480 pages) give 48 of each.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's.\n   - 4 complete hundreds (400 pages) give 40 of each.\n   - The last 88 pages (401-488) add 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, contributing 89 4's.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by thinking about each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I'll calculate how many 4's and 8's appear. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each block, the digit 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.) and the digit 8 appears once (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). \n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). \n\nIn each complete block, we have one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 times 1 for 4's and 48 times 1 for 8's. So, units place contributes 48 4's and 48 8's. \n\nNow, looking at the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the units digit 4 appears once (484) and the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, adding that, units place total is 48 + 1 = 49 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 8's. \n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so from 481 to 488, that's 8 pages: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, yes, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place contributes 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNext, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in every block of 100 numbers. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 times, and 8 for 80-89, which is 10 times. \n\nBut wait, in our case, the book goes up to 488, so we need to consider how many complete hundreds there are and any partial hundreds. \n\nSo, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial hundred from 401-488. \n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49) and the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 4's and 4 * 10 = 40 8's in the tens place. \n\nNow, looking at the partial hundred from 401-488. The tens digits here go from 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 for 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 pages, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. \n\nWait, no, actually, in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit, how many times does it appear? \n\nFor the tens digit 4: It's from 440-449, which is 10 pages. But wait, our range is up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, so that's 10 times. \n\nFor the tens digit 8: It's from 480-488, which is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. \n\nSo, in the partial hundred, the tens place contributes 10 4's and 9 8's. \n\nAdding that to the complete hundreds, the total for the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 4's and 40 + 9 = 49 8's. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would be 40 each, and the partial hundred adds 10 4's and 9 8's. So, total tens place: 50 4's and 49 8's. \n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. \n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. \n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 4's and 0 8's. \n\nNow, let's sum up all the digits. \n\nFirst, for 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 188 - 98 is 90, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 49 4's and 49 8's. Then in the tens place, 50 4's and 49 8's. So, adding up, 49 + 50 = 99 for 4's, plus 89 in hundreds place, so 99 + 89 = 188. For 8's, 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. So, yes, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the hundreds digit for 4's is from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? \n\nIn each hundred, 40-49 is 10 times, so 4 times 10 = 40. Then in 400-488, the tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is 10 times, so 40 + 10 = 50. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: Each hundred contributes 10 times (80-89), so 4 times 10 = 40. Then in 400-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 times, so 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8. Then the last 8 pages (481-488) contribute 1 more 4 and 1 more 8, so 48 +1 =49 each. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times because from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't overcount. For example, in 400, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's one, and 401 is another, up to 488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, I think I correctly accounted for 40-49 in each hundred and 440-449 in the last partial hundred, making it 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me think about the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 pages, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens and 8 extra pages. So, 48 times 1 = 48, plus in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, 48 +1 =49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for 8's in the units place: 48 times 1 =48, plus once in the last 8 pages (488), so 48 +1=49.\n\nSo, yes, units place: 49 each.\n\nSo, overall, 4's: 188, 8's:98, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought, in the hundreds place, the 4's are from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's. But in the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so that's 10 4's in the tens place. Similarly, the units digit 4 is in 484, which is one more 4. So, I think I accounted for all of them.\n\nWait, but let me think about the total number of digits. From 1-488, how many digits are there? Well, pages 1-9: 9 pages, each with 1 digit: 9 digits. Pages 10-99: 90 pages, each with 2 digits: 180 digits. Pages 100-488: 389 pages, each with 3 digits: 1167 digits. Total digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits. So, the total number of digits should be 1356.\n\nNow, total number of 4's: 188, as calculated. Total number of 8's:98.\n\nSo, 188 + 98 = 286. So, 286 digits are either 4 or 8. The rest are other digits. But the total digits are 1356, so 1356 - 286 = 1070 digits are other numbers. That seems plausible, but I don't see a mistake here.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure that when I counted the hundreds place, I didn't include 400-488 as 89 pages. Let me count: 488 - 400 +1 =89 pages. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, 440-449 is 10 pages, so 10 4's. In the units place, 484 is one 4. So, yes, 89 +10 +49=148? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, wait: 4's are in hundreds (89), tens (50), and units (49). So, 89 +50 +49=188. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, 8's are in hundreds (0), tens (49), and units (49). So, 0 +49 +49=98.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again: in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. In the tens place, 4 appears 50 times. In the units place, 49 times. So, 89 +50 +49=188.\n\nFor 8's: hundreds place 0, tens place 49, units place 49. So, 0 +49 +49=98.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks (1-480) and an extra 8 pages (481-488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 pages contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 complete hundreds (1-400), contributing 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - The partial hundred (401-488) contributes 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, contributing 89 4's.\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by thinking about the single-digit page numbers. These are from 1 to 9. In this range, how many 4's are there? Well, just one: page 4. Similarly, how many 8's? Just one: page 8. So, in single-digit pages, both 4 and 8 appear once each. That means the count for 4 is 1 and for 8 is 1, so the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, I'll move on to the two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in both places.\n\nLet's start with the tens place. For the tens digit being 4, the pages would be from 40 to 49. That's 10 pages, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, for the tens digit being 8, the pages are from 80 to 89, which is another 10 pages, so the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers. The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every ten pages. So, for each ten pages (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 14, 24, etc.), and the same for 8 (like 18, 28, etc.). There are 9 sets of ten in the two-digit numbers (10-99), so 9 times each for both 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers, which is 9 groups of 10. So, for each group, the units digit 4 appears once, so 9 times total for 4 in the units place. Same for 8: 9 times in the units place.\n\nSo, adding up the two-digit numbers: for 4's, it's 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 times. For 8's, it's 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 times. So again, the difference here is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because there are three places: hundreds, tens, and units. Let me handle each place separately.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 1 from 100-199, 2 from 200-299, 3 from 300-399, and 4 from 400-488. \n\nLet me count how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times for 4 in the hundreds place. For 8's, since the hundreds digit can't be 8 (as the book only goes up to 488), there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each hundred. So, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit can be 0-9, but in the case of 400-488, it goes up to 8 in the tens place because 488 is the last page.\n\nI need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place across all three-digit numbers.\n\nStarting with 4 in the tens place. Let's consider each hundred:\n\n1. 100-199: The tens digit is 4 for pages 140-149. That's 10 pages, so 10 times 4 in the tens place.\n2. 200-299: Similarly, 240-249: 10 times.\n3. 300-399: 340-349: 10 times.\n4. 400-488: Here, the tens digit 4 would be from 440-449, which is 10 pages.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow for 8 in the tens place:\n\n1. 100-199: 180-189: 10 times.\n2. 200-299: 280-289: 10 times.\n3. 300-399: 380-389: 10 times.\n4. 400-488: The tens digit 8 would be from 480-488, but wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many pages is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 pages (480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488). So, 9 times instead of 10.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, but I should check if 400-488 includes 480-488. Let me confirm: 480 is within 400-488, so yes, that's correct. So, 9 times for the 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, each hundred has units digits from 0-9, and we need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place.\n\nFor each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), in each set of ten, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, for each hundred, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Once every ten pages, so 10 times per hundred. Similarly for 8.\n\nBut wait, for the last hundred, 400-488, we have to check if all units digits are included. Since 488 is the last page, the units digits go up to 8, but 488 is included. So, for units digits, in 400-488, the units digits go from 0 to 8 in the last set (480-488). So, the units digit 4 would be in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times, right? Because from 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs at 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times, not 10, because the last page is 488, so 489 isn't included.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 400-488 includes 400 to 488. So, the units digit 4 occurs at 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times. Similarly, the units digit 8 occurs at 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 times as well.\n\nWait, but in the other hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each of these hundreds has 100 pages, so the units digit cycles completely from 0-9 ten times. So, for each of these, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the units place, and similarly for 8.\n\nSo, for 4 in the units place:\n\n- 100-199: 10 times\n- 200-299: 10 times\n- 300-399: 10 times\n- 400-488: 9 times\n\nTotal 4's in units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place:\n\n- 100-199: 10 times\n- 200-299: 10 times\n- 300-399: 10 times\n- 400-488: 9 times\n\nTotal 8's in units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For 400-488, does the units digit 4 occur 9 times? Let me list them:\n\n404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Yes, that's 9 numbers. Similarly, for 8, it's 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. Also 9 numbers.\n\nSo, for the units place in three-digit numbers, 4 appears 39 times and 8 appears 39 times. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me add up all the three-digit counts.\n\nSo, for three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's in hundreds place: 89\n- 4's in tens place: 40\n- 4's in units place: 39\nTotal 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- 8's in hundreds place: 0\n- 8's in tens place: 39\n- 8's in units place: 39\nTotal 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, earlier I thought the tens place for 8's in three-digit numbers was 39, and units place was 39, so total 78. But let me check again.\n\nWait, in the tens place for three-digit numbers, 8's were 39, and units place 39, so 78 total. But let me confirm the tens place count again.\n\nEarlier, for the tens place:\n\n- 100-199: 180-189: 10\n- 200-299: 280-289: 10\n- 300-399: 380-389: 10\n- 400-488: 480-488: 9\n\nSo, total 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, units place:\n\n- 100-199: 10\n- 200-299: 10\n- 300-399: 10\n- 400-488: 9\nTotal: 39.\n\nSo, 8's in three-digit numbers: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nWait, but wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, but 8 doesn't appear there at all, so 0. Then, in the tens and units places, 8 appears 39 times each, totaling 78. \n\nNow, let me add up all the 4's across all page numbers:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\nTwo-digit: 19\nThree-digit: 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\nSimilarly, total 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\nTwo-digit: 19\nThree-digit: 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in single-digit, both 4 and 8 appear once. In two-digit, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each. In three-digit, 4's are 168 and 8's are 78. So, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188. Total 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the three-digit 4's.\n\nIn three-digit numbers, the hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: 4 in the tens digit occurs 10 times in each hundred except the last one, which is 10 times as well, because 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 times.\n\nUnits place: In each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the units place, except the last hundred (400-488), where it appears 9 times because the last page is 488. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nSo, 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\nTens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\nUnits place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\nTotal: 78\n\nAdding single-digit and two-digit counts:\n\n4's: 1 + 19 = 20\n8's: 1 + 19 = 20\n\nSo, total 4's: 20 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's: 20 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I double-counted somewhere. Let me check again.\n\nWait, single-digit: 1-9, correct.\n\nTwo-digit: 10-99, correct.\n\nThree-digit: 100-488, correct.\n\nIn three-digit, 4's in hundreds place: 89\n4's in tens place: 40\n4's in units place: 39\nTotal 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n\n8's in tens place: 39\n8's in units place: 39\nTotal 8's: 78\n\nAdding single and two-digit:\n\n4's: 1 + 19 = 20\n8's: 1 + 19 = 20\n\nTotal 4's: 20 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's: 20 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe using a formula or a different counting method to confirm.\n\nAnother approach is to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nFor units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, total groups of 10: 488 / 10 = 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Plus, in the last partial group (481-488), 484 is included, so that's one more. So, total 49 times for 4 in units place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in units place: same logic. 488 / 10 = 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Plus, in the last group, 488 is included, so that's one more. So, 49 times for 8 in units place.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 39 for three-digit units place, but this approach gives 49. There's a discrepancy here. I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted in the three-digit section. Let me see.\n\nWait, using this method, the total number of 4's in units place is 49, and 8's in units place is 49. But in my earlier count, I had 39 for both in three-digit, but that was only considering three-digit numbers. Wait, perhaps I should adjust.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the units place counting from 1 to 488 includes all page numbers, not just three-digit. So, in the earlier approach, I separated single, two, and three-digit numbers, but perhaps using this units place approach is better.\n\nWait, let me try this again.\n\nTotal number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488:\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete decades are there in 488? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, in the incomplete decade (481-488), 484 is present, so that's one more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in units place: 488 / 10 = 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. In the incomplete decade, 488 is present, so one more. Total 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nSo, 4's in units place: 49\n8's in units place: 49\nDifference: 0\n\nWait, but earlier I had 39 for three-digit units place, but this approach is considering all page numbers, so perhaps I should adjust.\n\nWait, perhaps I should count each digit place separately across all page numbers.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\nHow many times does 4 appear in the tens place from 1 to 488?\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nFrom 1-99: 10 times\n100-199: 10 times\n200-299: 10 times\n300-399: 10 times\n400-488: How many times? From 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times.\n\nWait, but 488 is less than 490, so 440-449 is fully included, so 10 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 10 (1-99) + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place:\n\nFrom 1-99: 10 times (180-189)\n100-199: 10 times (180-189)\n200-299: 10 times (280-289)\n300-399: 10 times (380-389)\n400-488: The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 times (since 488 is the last page).\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but in 400-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place: 10 (1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in tens place: 50 times.\n\nSo, 4's in tens place: 50\n8's in tens place: 49\nDifference: 1\n\nNow, for hundreds place:\n\nHow many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nHow many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, 4's in hundreds place: 89\n8's in hundreds place: 0\nDifference: 89\n\nNow, adding up all the differences:\n\nUnits place: 4's - 8's = 49 - 49 = 0\nTens place: 50 - 49 = 1\nHundreds place: 89 - 0 = 89\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90\n\nSo, that confirms the earlier result. The total number of 4's is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier when I separated into single, two, and three-digit numbers, I had the same result. So, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let me count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place across all page numbers.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nAs before, 49 4's and 49 8's, so difference 0.\n\nTens place:\n\n4's: 50\n8's: 49\nDifference: +1\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's: 89\n8's: 0\nDifference: +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place: 50\nHundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place: 49\nHundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in my initial approach when I separated into single, two, and three-digit numbers, I had:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 each\nTwo-digit: 19 each\nThree-digit: 168 (4's) and 78 (8's)\nTotal: 188 (4's) and 98 (8's), difference 90.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, after carefully counting each digit place, I'm confident that the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit place (units, tens, and hundreds) separately, we find that the digit 4 appears 188 times, while the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I'll calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, every 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once. So, in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). \n\nIn each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 times 1, which is 48, and the same for 8's. But wait, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial group, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, adding those, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so in the units place, they are equal.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each cycle of 100 has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per 100 numbers.\n\nNow, from 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then the last partial hundred from 401-488. \n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the same for 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for each complete hundred, 4 and 8 each contribute 10 to their counts. There are 4 complete hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40 for both 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, the last partial hundred is from 401-488. Let's look at the tens digit here. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in this range. Specifically, 401-410: tens digit is 0; 410-420: tens digit is 1; ... up to 480-488: tens digit is 8. So, in this partial hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480 is included, so from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. Wait, but 480 is the start of the tens digit 8 in this partial hundred, but 480-488 is 9 numbers (including 480). So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, for the tens digit 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For the tens digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, adding that to the complete hundreds, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from partial) = 50. The number of 8's in the tens place is 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from partial) = 49.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me make sure. So, in each complete hundred, 10 times each digit in tens place, so 4 complete hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (440-449), and the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times (480-488). So yes, 4's tens count is 50, 8's is 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in the range 1-488, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. It never reaches 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, the digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences.\n\nFirst, for the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's compute that. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere.\n\nStarting with units place: I considered 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 each. Then, the last partial group (481-488) has 484 and 488, so that's one more 4 and one more 8, making it 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each complete hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. There are four complete hundreds, so 4*10=40 each. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 440-449 (10 times) and 8 for 480-488 (9 times). So, 4's tens count is 40 +10=50, and 8's is 40 +9=49. That adds up correctly.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. The hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0 8's. That seems right.\n\nAdding up: 4's total is 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188. 8's total is 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98. The difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct because each page from 400 onwards has a hundreds digit of 4 until 488.\n\nIs there any other place where 4's or 8's might appear? I don't think so because we've covered units, tens, and hundreds places. So, I think the calculation is correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. We analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Complete groups of 10: 48 groups \u2192 48 occurrences of '4' and '8'.\n   - Partial group (481-488): 1 '4' (484) and 1 '8' (488).\n   - Total: 49 each.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Complete hundreds (1-400): 4 hundreds \u2192 40 each.\n   - Partial hundred (401-488): 10 '4's (440-449) and 9 '8's (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 400-488: 89 '4's.\n   - '8' doesn't appear in hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 '4's and 0 '8's.\n\nSumming up:\n- Total '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Total '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I'll calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear. \n\nFirst, the units place. In the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits go from 1 to 0. Wait, actually, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers. But since the first page is 1, not 0, maybe I need to adjust for that. Wait, no, because the units digit cycles every 10 pages, starting from 0. So, in the range 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,...,9,0, so 0 appears once, and 1-9 each appear once. Similarly, in 11-20, the units digits are 1,2,...,9,0 again. So, for each block of 10 pages, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. \n\nSo, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and an extra 8 pages. Wait, no, actually, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so 48 complete blocks of 10 and 8 extra pages. But wait, starting from page 1, the first block is 1-10, then 11-20, up to 481-490, but since the book ends at 488, the last block is only up to 488. So, maybe I should calculate the number of times each digit appears in the units place up to page 488.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate for each digit place separately.\n\nLet me first calculate the number of 4's in the units place.\n\nIn the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 numbers. So, in 488 pages, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 pages, 4 appears once in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (blocks of 10) multiplied by 1, plus any additional occurrences in the incomplete block.\n\nWait, but page 1 is the first page, so the first block is 1-10, which includes pages 1,2,...,10. In this block, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, 4 appears once in the units place. Then, the next block is 11-20, units digits 1,2,...,0, so again 4 appears once. This continues up to the block 481-490, but since the book ends at 488, the last block is 481-488, which has 8 pages. So, in each complete block of 10, 4 appears once in the units place. How many complete blocks are there? From 1-480, that's 48 blocks of 10, so 48 times 4's in the units place. Then, in the last 8 pages, 481-488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once more in 484. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place. Each block of 10 pages has one 8 in the units place. So, 48 complete blocks give 48 times, and in the last 8 pages, 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place. So, the difference so far is zero. Hmm, but I might have made a mistake here because page 1 starts at 1, not 0, so maybe the first block is 1-10, but page 10 is included, so in the first block, 0 appears in page 10, but 1-9 appear in 1-9. So, in each block of 10, 0 appears once, and 1-9 each appear once in the units place. So, 48 blocks would have 48 times 4's, and then in the last 8 pages, 481-488, 4 appears once at 484, and 8 appears once at 488. So, yes, 49 each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each block of 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles from 0 (pages 1-9) to 9 (pages 91-100). Wait, actually, pages 1-9 have tens digit 0, pages 10-19 have tens digit 1, ..., pages 90-99 have tens digit 9, and pages 100-109 have tens digit 0 again. So, each digit in the tens place appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n\nSo, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, each 100 pages, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, in 400 pages, that's 4 times 100, so 4 times 10 = 40 times. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8. So, in the tens place, 4 appears once in 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488? Wait, 440 is after 400, so yes. So, from 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. But wait, 440-449 is 10 pages, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in that block. But wait, 488 is less than 500, so after 400, the next 100 would be 400-499, but the book ends at 488, so from 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nWait, maybe I should break it down differently. The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 pages long. So, how many such ranges are there within 488 pages?\n\nFrom 1-488, the ranges where the tens digit is 4 are:\n\n- 40-49: 10 pages\n- 140-149: 10 pages\n- 240-249: 10 pages\n- 340-349: 10 pages\n- 440-449: 10 pages\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 times. So, 5*10 = 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10 pages, 140-149 another 10, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 end at 449, which is before 488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the 8's in the tens place. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 pages (480-488). So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nEach of the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 is 10 pages, but 480-488 is only 9 pages. So, total number of times 8 appears in the tens place is 4 ranges of 10 pages each, contributing 4*10=40, plus the 480-488 range, which has 9 pages where the tens digit is 8 (480-488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me confirm. From 1-488:\n\n- 80-89: 10 pages\n- 180-189: 10 pages\n- 280-289: 10 pages\n- 380-389: 10 pages\n- 480-488: 9 pages\n\nSo, that's 4 full ranges of 10, contributing 40, and one partial range of 9, so total 49. So, 8's in the tens place: 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. So, the difference here is 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but the book ends at 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- 488 pages, so 48 complete decades (48*10=480 pages) and 8 extra pages. Each decade contributes 1 '4' in the units place, so 48*1=48. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once at 484. So, total 49 '4's in units place. Similarly for '8's: 48*1=48, plus one in 488, total 49. So that's correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For '4's: Each 100 pages, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, '4' appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total 50 '4's in tens place. Correct.\n\nFor '8's in tens place: Each 100 pages, '8' appears 10 times in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, '8' appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, total 49 '8's in tens place. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- '4' appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 '4's. Correct.\n- '8' never appears in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, total '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place for '4's. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so '4' appears 89 times in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: from 400-488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, when I was calculating '4's, I included 440-449 as 10 pages, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for '8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nSo, all the counts seem correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of '4's is 188, and '8's is 98, so the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the difference in the tens place was 1, and in the hundreds place it's 89, so 1+89=90. Yes, that adds up.\n\nSo, I think the final answer is 90 more '4's than '8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - For 488 pages, there are 48 complete decades (480 pages) and 8 extra pages.\n   - **4's:** 48 times in complete decades + 1 in 484 = 49.\n   - **8's:** 48 times in complete decades + 1 in 488 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - **4's:** 4 sets of 10 pages (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349) = 40.

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, for the units place: In every set of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers. So, in each of these 48 sets, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which adds one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in every block of 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're dealing with three-digit numbers starting from 100, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. However, for the tens place, 4 can appear in each hundred block. So, from 1-100, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, in 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10 times, and so on. But wait, the book goes up to 488, so in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, but 450-488 would have tens digits from 5 to 8, so no more 4's in the tens place beyond that. So, how many complete hundreds are there? Let's see: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, from 1-400, there are four complete hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. That's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8, so 440-449 is within this range, adding another 10 4's. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 488 is less than 500, so I think I might have made a mistake. Let me check again. From 1-100: 40-49 (10 times). 101-200: 140-149 (10 times). 201-300: 240-249 (10 times). 301-400: 340-349 (10 times). 401-488: 440-449 (10 times). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, totaling 50. So, yes, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but wait, 400 is the first number with a hundreds digit of 4, and it goes up to 488. So, yes, 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is a three-digit number, but let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me recalculate. Units place: 48 full tens (each contributing 1) plus 1 more in 484, so 49. Tens place: 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 89 numbers (400-488), each contributing 1, so 89. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems high, but let me check.\n\nWait, 488 is the last page, so from 1-488, how many 4's? Let me think differently. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. Then, in the tens place, every hundred block has a 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so up to 400, that's 4 times (1-400), but wait, from 1-400, it's 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is another 10, so 40+10=50. So that's correct. Units place: in each ten, 1 occurrence, so 48 full tens (1-480) gives 48, then 484 is the 49th. So 49. So total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nUnits place: In every set of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many full tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 488 is included, which adds another 1. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, how many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 8's because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit is 8 for all these, so 9 times. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The first block is 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's. Then 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Then 480-488: 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check again. Units place: 48 full tens (each contributing 1) plus 1 in 488, so 49. Tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 10 each, so 40, plus 480-488 contributing 9, so 49. So, 49 + 49 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nSo, now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me just cross-verify. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 4's, so 50. Units place: 49. So, 89 + 50 + 49 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 49, tens place: 49, so 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that's the calculation. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 188 seems high for 4's. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place: For each ten numbers, 4 appears once. From 1-488, there are 48 full tens (1-480) and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For each hundred numbers, 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). From 1-488, how many such hundreds are there? Let's see:\n\n1-100: 40-49 (10)\n101-200:140-149 (10)\n201-300:240-249 (10)\n301-400:340-349 (10)\n401-488:440-449 (10)\n\nSo, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: Each ten has one 8, so 48 full tens (1-480) plus 1 in 488, so 49.\n\nTens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four contributes 10, and the last contributes 9, so 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: None, since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - In every set of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10 and 8 extra numbers.\n   - 48 sets \u00d7 1 = 48, plus 1 from 484, totaling 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - In every block of 100 numbers, 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49).\n   - From 1-488, there are 5 such blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488).\n   - 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - 48 full sets \u00d7 1 = 48, plus 1 from 488, totaling 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Four blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** 90 more 4's are printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of ten numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears once (at page 4); in 11-20, it appears once (at page 14), and so on. \n\nHow many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, we'll consider 48 full groups and then the remaining 8 pages. So, in each of the 48 full groups, there's one 4 in the units place, giving 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (at page 484). So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for the tens digit, each group of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for pages 40-49, which is 10 times. This pattern repeats every 100 pages. \n\nSo, how many full hundreds are there in 488 pages? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). Each full hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for pages 440-449, which is 10 times. So, adding that, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. \n\nWait, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99, and 89 (hundreds) so total 99 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct. So, total 4's are 188.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. Starting with the units place: Each group of ten has one 8 in the units place. So, for 488 pages, that's 48 full groups (48 x 10 = 480) plus 8 pages. In each group, one 8, so 48, plus in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit is 1-8, so 8 appears once (at page 488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: Each group of 100 has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place (e.g., 80-89 in each hundred). So, 4 full hundreds contribute 4 x 10 = 40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, 8 appears in the tens place for pages 480-488. Wait, that's 9 pages (480-488 inclusive), but actually, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 pages. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place. Therefore, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, that's 49 + 49 = 98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. In the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488. That's 9 pages (480,481,...,488), so 9 8's in the tens place. So, 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for the units place, 48 full groups (480) plus 8 pages, so 48 +1=49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nFor 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\n188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll go through each position and calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each, then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits go from 1 to 0. In each set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (at page 4), and 8 appears once (at page 8). This pattern repeats every 10 pages. \n\nNow, I need to figure out how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488 pages. Let's divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 groups with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete sets of 10 pages and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete group of 10, as I said, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 groups, that would be 48 times 1 for 4's, which is 48, and 48 times 1 for 8's, which is also 48. \n\nNow, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8. So, in these, the units digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, here, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). \n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 48 (from complete groups) + 1 (from the last partial group) = 49. \nTotal 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. \n\nHmm, so so far, units place gives me equal numbers of 4's and 8's. So, the difference so far is zero. \n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. \n\nBut wait, actually, for 1-9, the tens digit is 0, so in the first 9 pages, the tens digit isn't present. So, perhaps I should adjust that. Wait, maybe it's better to consider each hundred block separately.\n\nLet me think. From 1-99, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9, each appearing 10 times. But actually, from 1-9, the tens digit is 0, so the first 9 numbers don't have a tens digit, but from 10-99, each tens digit from 1 to 9 appears 10 times. So, in 1-99, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49) and 8 appears 10 times (80-89). \n\nSimilarly, in 100-199, the tens digit again cycles from 0 to 9, so 4 appears 10 times (140-149) and 8 appears 10 times (180-189). \n\nThis pattern continues for each subsequent hundred. So, for 200-299, 300-399, etc., each hundred block contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. \n\nNow, our book goes up to 488, so let's see how many hundreds we have. \n\n1-99: 99 pages\n100-199: another 100 pages\n200-299: another 100\n300-399: another 100\n400-488: 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89)\n\nWait, let me check that: 400 to 488 is 89 pages because 488 - 400 = 88, and adding 1 gives 89.\n\nSo, in each hundred block, the tens digit contributes 10 4's and 10 8's. \n\nNow, how many complete hundreds do we have? Let's see:\n\n1-99: 99 pages\n100-199: 100 pages\n200-299: 100 pages\n300-399: 100 pages\n400-488: 89 pages\n\nSo, from 1-399, we have four complete hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399). Each of these contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, that's 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 4's and 40 8's from the tens place in these blocks.\n\nNow, the last block is 400-488. Let's analyze the tens digit here. The tens digit in 400-488 goes from 0 (400-409) to 8 (480-488). Wait, but 488 is the end, so the tens digit in 480-488 is 8, but only for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. Wait, actually, 480 has a tens digit of 8, and 481-488 also have 8 as the tens digit. So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. But wait, in 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 (400-409) to 8 (480-488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times except for the last one, which may not complete a full 10. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, 400-409: tens digit 0, 10 numbers\n410-419: tens digit 1, 10 numbers\n...\n470-479: tens digit 7, 10 numbers\n480-488: tens digit 8, 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nTherefore, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit contributes 10 4's and 9 8's.\n\nSo, adding that to the previous total from 1-399:\n\nTotal 4's in tens place: 40 (from 1-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 (from 1-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 49\n\nSo, so far, in the tens place, we have 50 4's and 49 8's, giving a difference of +1 for 4's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me recount the 400-488 block. The tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, correct. The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times, correct. So, yes, 10 and 9 respectively.\n\nSo, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present in three-digit numbers, from 100 onwards. So, let's see how many times each hundreds digit appears.\n\nFrom 1-99: no hundreds digit, so 0 for all hundreds digits.\n100-199: hundreds digit is 1, appearing 100 times.\n200-299: hundreds digit is 2, appearing 100 times.\n300-399: hundreds digit is 3, appearing 100 times.\n400-488: hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nWait, so the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, from 400-488.\n\nNow, how many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Well, in our book, the highest page is 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. The hundreds digits go up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, and 8's appear 0 times. So, that's a difference of +89 for 4's.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the digits across units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place: 50\nHundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place: 49\nHundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me check my calculations again because I think I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, earlier, in the units place, I had 49 4's and 49 8's. Then, in the tens place, I had 50 4's and 49 8's. So, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I added up the 4's and 8's, I thought the difference was 90, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the counts.\n\nWait, let me go through each digit place again to confirm.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1-488, each 10 pages contribute one 4 and one 8 in the units place. There are 48 complete groups of 10, contributing 48 each, and the last 8 pages (481-488) contribute one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49; same for 8's: 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1-399, each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. There are four hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 each. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total tens 4's: 40 + 10 = 50; tens 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-99: 0\n100-199: 100 times 1\n200-299: 100 times 2\n300-399: 100 times 3\n400-488: 89 times 4\nSo, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 never appears.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so the difference is 90 more 4's than 8's. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, another way to check: Let's compute the total number of 4's and 8's in each digit position again.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488 / 10) = 48 full decades, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus, in the last partial decade (481-488), check if 4 is present. Yes, at 484, so +1. Total 49.\n\nSimilarly for 8's: same calculation, 48 +1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in tens place: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, each appearing 10 times. So, in each hundred, 10 times. From 1-399, that's four hundreds, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place: In each hundred, 10 times, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, total 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly 400-488 has the hundreds digit 4, which is 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again: When I count the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That seems correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nBut let me think about another approach. Maybe using a formula or a different counting method to verify.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit position, calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488 / 10) = 48, plus if the units digit in 488 is >=4, add 1. Since 488's units digit is 8, which is >=4, so +1. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: floor(488 / 10) = 48, plus if units digit >=8, add 1. Since 8 >=8, so +1. So, 48 +1=49.\n\nTens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488 / 100) = 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 times. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, the remaining pages are 88 (since 488 - 400 = 88). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear in the remaining 88 pages? Well, from 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages. Since 449 is less than 488, that's 10 times. So, total 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in tens place: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? From 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor((488 - 100 + 1) / 100) = floor(389 / 100) = 3, but wait, that's not the right approach. Wait, perhaps better to think that the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nNumber of 8's: 0, since the book ends at 488, so hundreds digit never reaches 8.\n\nSo, again, 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 90.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the hundreds digit count earlier. Wait, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's there. From 100-199, hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's. Similarly, 200-299: 2, 300-399:3. Only from 400-488 is the hundreds digit 4, which is 89 times. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to check: Let's calculate the total number of digits printed. Each page number from 1 to 488. Pages 1-9: 1 digit each, total 9 digits. Pages 10-99: 90 pages, 2 digits each, total 180 digits. Pages 100-488: 488 - 99 = 389 pages, 3 digits each, total 1167 digits. So, total digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits. Wait, but this might not help directly, but just to confirm that my earlier counts for 4's and 8's are plausible.\n\nWait, 4's: 188, 8's:98. So, total digits accounted for by 4's and 8's: 188 + 98 = 286. Which is less than 1356, so that seems okay.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about another approach: For each digit position, compute the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: As calculated, 49\nNumber of 8's: 49\n\nTens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's:50\nNumber of 8's:49\n\nHundreds digit:\n\nNumber of 4's:89\nNumber of 8's:0\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:49 +50 +89=188\n8's:49 +49 +0=98\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about the hundreds digit again. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 times. So, 89 4's in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. Correct.\n\nIn the units place, 488 is the last page, so units digits go up to 8, so in the last partial group, 481-488, units digits 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct, and the difference is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each place for both 4 and 8 and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). But wait, in the units place, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears is equal to the number of complete decades (10s) plus any extra in the last incomplete decade. So, 48 full decades (each contributing 1) plus 1 more if the last number in the incomplete decade has a 4 in the units place. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last decade is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the units digits go up to 8. So, in the units place, the 4 appears once in each decade, and since 488 is less than 490, the 48th decade ends at 480, so the 48th decade has 480, which is 4 in the tens place, but in the units place, the 4 would be at 484. So, from 1 to 488, how many 4's are in the units place? It's 48 times because each decade contributes one, and 488 is the 48th decade (since 480 is the 48th multiple of 10). Wait, no, 10 to 488 is 488 numbers, but each decade is 10 numbers. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the 49th decade, but since it's incomplete, we have to check if 484 is within 481-488. Yes, 484 is in that range, so that's the 49th occurrence? Wait, no, because the first decade is 1-10, which is 10 numbers, but the units digit cycles every 10. So, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 times because 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 8, so the units digit 4 would occur once in each of the 48 full decades, so 48 times.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller number to see if this logic holds. For example, from 1 to 20, how many 4's in the units place? 4,14,24. Wait, 24 is beyond 20, so only 4 and 14, so two times. 20 /10 =2, so that works. So, applying that, 488 /10=48.8, so 48 times. So, units place: 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, 10 times in each block. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, from 140-149, and so on. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see: The first block is 40-49, the second is 140-149, third is 240-249, fourth is 340-349, fifth would be 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d710=50 times. But wait, does the last block go beyond 488? 440-449 is within 488, so yes, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 times.\n\nWait, let me check with a smaller number. From 1 to 50, how many 4's in the tens place? 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. 50/100=0.5, so 0 full blocks beyond the first, but we have one block (40-49), so 10 times. That works. So, for 488, how many blocks? The first block is 40-49, second 140-149, third 240-249, fourth 340-349, fifth 440-449. So, five blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 4's.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nStarting with the units place again. Similar to the 4's, each group of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488/10=48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Plus, in the last incomplete decade, which is 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48+1=49 times.\n\nWait, let me check with a smaller number. From 1 to 20, 8's in units place: 8,18, so two times. 20/10=2, so 2 times, but since 20 is a complete decade, it's 2 times. Wait, but in my earlier logic, I added 1 for the incomplete decade, but in this case, 20 is a complete decade, so 2 times. So, perhaps my initial approach was wrong. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last decade is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the units digits go up to 8. So, in the units place, the 8 appears once in each full decade and once in the incomplete decade if 8 is within that range. So, from 1 to 488, the number of 8's in the units place is 48 full decades (each contributing 1) plus 1 for the 488, so 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me think again. For example, from 1 to 10, 8 appears once. From 11 to 20, once, and so on. So, up to 480, which is 48 decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 has an 8, so that's one more, making it 49.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, units place: 49 times.\n\nNow, tens place for 8's. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. So, how many blocks? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nSo, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the fifth block contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 +9=49.\n\nWait, let me verify with a smaller number. From 1 to 100, how many 8's in the tens place? 80-89, which is 10 times. So, 10 times. From 1 to 200, it's two blocks: 80-89 and 180-189, so 20 times. So, yes, each block of 100 contributes 10. So, for 488, the blocks are 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. So, first four blocks: 4\u00d710=40, and the last block:9, so total 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place for 8's. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nWait, let me add that again: units 49, tens 49, so 49+49=98. So, 98 8's.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) -98 (8's)=89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct.\n\nCounting 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, 187-98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything in the tens place for 4's. I had 5 blocks of 10 in the tens place for 4's: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5\u00d710=50. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, I had 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four contributes 10, and the last contributes 9, so 4\u00d710+9=49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's:48, for 8's:49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4's:400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. For 8's, nothing in hundreds place.\n\nSo, 187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 89 more 4's.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, etc. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and a partial block of 8 pages. In each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. In the partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total 4's in the units place: 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. Here, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, 10 times in each block. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Now, how many full blocks of 100 are there in 488? There are four full blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 8 for 480-488. Wait, no, 401-409 have tens digit 0, and 410-419 have tens digit 1, and so on up to 480-488, where the tens digit is 8. So, in the last block, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 4's. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, there are 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again.\n\nStarting with the units place. As before, in each block of 10, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. There are 48 full blocks of 10 in 488 pages, so that's 48 8's. In the partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once here. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Each full block (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. There are four full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), so that's 4 * 10 = 40. In the last partial block (480-488), the tens digit is 8, and there are 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so that's 9 8's. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for 400-488, and 1, 2, 3 for 100-399. So, no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, let me check again. In the units place, I had 48 full blocks contributing 48 8's, and the last partial block from 481-488 has units digits 1-8, so 8 appears once. So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49. \n\nIn the tens place, each full block (80-89, etc.) is 10 numbers, so 4 blocks contribute 40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but when I count the 4's, I got 187, and 8's as 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. But wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the units place for 4's, I had 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the partial block (481-488), units digits go from 1 to 8, so no 4's there. So, 48 units 4's.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears in each block of 100, 10 times, so 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) give 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so another 10. So, total 50 4's in tens place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. So, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's: units place, 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), units digit 8 appears once. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nIn the tens place, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: each contributes 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 8's in tens place. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, as the hundreds digit doesn't reach 8.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, in the tens place for 8's: 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 10 8's. Similarly, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 each have 10 8's. So, that's 4*10=40. Then, 480-488: from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last block (481-488) has one more 8, so 49.\n\nSo, 8's total is 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n4's total is 187.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me think again. Wait, in the hundreds place, 488 is the last page, so 400-488 is 89 pages. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but when counting 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, yes, 49 in tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? For every 10 numbers, once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and then in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so that's one more 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributing 10 8's, and then 480-488 contributes 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, 8's total is 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n4's total is 187.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be different, but maybe it's correct. Let me try another approach to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I can count the number of 4's and 8's separately by looking at each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: As calculated, 48.\n\n- Tens place: 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49.\n\n- Tens place: 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but wait, in the hundreds place for 4's, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's there.\n\nIn the tens place, 4's appear in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. Wait, earlier I thought it was four blocks, but actually, from 0-488, the blocks are 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, in each of the first four blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10. So, 4 blocks * 10 = 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is another 10. So, total 50. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, and the last partial block doesn't add any, so 48.\n\nSo, yes, 187 4's.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49.\n\n- Tens place: 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal: 98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nTherefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't double-count or miss any numbers.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: In each set of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, total sets of 10 in 488 pages: floor(488/10) = 48 full sets, contributing 48 4's. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 4 doesn't appear in the units place, so total 48.\n\n- Tens place: In each set of 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49, etc.). So, how many full sets of 100 are there? 4 (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399). Each contributes 10 4's, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last set (400-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so another 10. Total 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: Similarly, in each set of 10, 8 appears once. 48 full sets, so 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 8 appears once, so total 49.\n\n- Tens place: In each set of 100, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89, etc.). So, 4 full sets (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in the last set (400-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. Total 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: No 8's, as the hundreds digit goes up to 4.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each position one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. Units place: For every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such blocks are there? Since the book has 488 pages, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, for the tens place, 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, 10 times. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Wait, actually, the tens place 4 appears in each of these blocks. So, each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, after 400, the next block would be 401-500, but since we only go up to 488, the tens place 4's would be from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, that's actually part of the 401-500 block, but since 488 is less than 500, we have 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10. So, total in tens place: 4\u00d710 +10=50.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again. From 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then from 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, and 340-349, each adding 10. That's 4 blocks, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50.\n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, for the hundreds place, 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to 4, every block of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full blocks of 10 are there? 488 \u00f710=48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8. Then, the last partial block is 481-488, which includes 488, so the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\n2. Tens place: For the tens place, 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. How many such blocks are there in 488? Let's see: 488 \u00f7100=4.88, so 4 full hundreds. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears once, contributing 10 8's. So, 4 blocks \u00d710=40. Now, after 400, the next block would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times (since 488 is included). So, total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 +9=40+9=49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1-100, the tens digit 8 is in 80-89, which is 10 numbers. Then 180-189, another 10, 280-289, another 10, and 380-389, another 10. That's 4 blocks, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 more. So, total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the hundreds place. Since 488 is less than 800, there's no page number where the hundreds digit is 8. So, yes, 0.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, total 4's are 188, total 8's are 98. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, let me just cross-verify my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 full blocks (1-480), each contributing 1, so 48. Then, 484 is the 49th, so total 49. That seems right.\n\n- Tens: 4 blocks of 100 (1-400), each contributing 10, so 40. Then, 440-449 is another 10, so total 50. That seems correct.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place. So, 89. So, 49+50+89=188. That adds up.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 full blocks, each 1, so 48. Then, 488 adds one more, so 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens: 4 blocks of 100, each 10, so 40. Then, 480-488 adds 9, so 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: 0. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I should recount the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd for the tens place in 4's, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** Every block of 10 numbers contributes one '4'. There are 48 full blocks (1-480) and one more in 484, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens place:** Every block of 100 numbers contributes 10 '4's. There are 4 full blocks (1-400) and another 10 in 440-449, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** Numbers 400-488 contribute 89 '4's.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** Every block of 10 numbers contributes one '8'. There are 48 full blocks and one more in 488, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens place:** Every block of 100 numbers contributes 10 '8's. There are 4 full blocks and another 9 in 480-488, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No '8's since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe digit '4' appears 90 times more than the digit '8' in the page numbers.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14; and so on. \n\nNow, how many such sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each of the 48 full sets, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once more in 484. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for the tens digit, every 100 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times. So, in each 100 numbers, there are 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. \n\nNow, how many full hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each of these 4 full hundreds, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each hundred. Let's see, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), up to 8 (481-490), but since we only go up to 488, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. \n\nWait, actually, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490), but since 488 is the last page, the tens digit in 481-488 is 8, but only 8 numbers. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in 401-488? Let me think. The tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, that's another 10 occurrences. Therefore, in the tens place, the total number of 4's is 40 (from the four full hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n\nWait, but hold on, 401-488 includes 440-449, so that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400 is the first page with 4 in the hundreds place, and the last is 488. So, from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed are 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check each step.\n\nUnits place: 48 full sets of 10, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in 481-488, 484 has a 4 in units place, so +1, total 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40, plus in 401-488, 440-449 contributes another 10, so 50 total. That seems right.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, maybe that's correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with units place: Again, for every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, same as 4's, 48 full sets of 10, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in 481-488, the units digit 8 appears in 488, so that's +1, making total 49.\n\nTens place: For the tens digit, in each 100 numbers, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but actually, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place in the last partial hundred. So, total in tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again: From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's correct. So, tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check units place again. For the units digit, from 1-488, how many 8's? Every 10 numbers, one 8 in units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: As above, 40 from full hundreds plus 9 from 480-488, total 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, since 800-899 isn't in the book.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but wait, in the tens place, when we're counting 480-488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8, right? So, 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, yes, 49 in tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full sets (1-480) with 1 each, so 48, plus 484 in 481-488, so +1, total 49.\n- Tens place: 4 full hundreds (1-400) with 10 each, so 40, plus 440-449 in 401-488, which is 10, so total 50.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nCounting 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full sets (1-480) with 1 each, so 48, plus 488 in 481-488, so +1, total 49.\n- Tens place: 4 full hundreds (1-400) with 10 each, so 40, plus 480-488 in 401-488, which is 9, so total 49.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. And in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute 1 '4' in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full sets of 10 in 480 pages, contributing 48 '4's.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) include 484, adding 1 more '4'.\n   - Total in units place: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers contribute 10 '4's in the tens place.\n   - Four full hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 '4's.\n   - The range 401-488 includes 440-449, adding 10 '4's.\n   - Total in tens place: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have '4' in the hundreds place, totaling 89 pages.\n   - Total in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit '8':**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Similar to '4's, there are 48 full sets contributing 48 '8's.\n   - The last page 488 adds 1 more '8'.\n   - Total in units place: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Four full hundreds contribute 40 '8's.\n   - Pages 480-488 contribute 9 '8's in the tens place.\n   - Total in tens place: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No pages in 1-488 have '8' in the hundreds place.\n   - Total in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 times more than the digit '8'.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each place for both 4 and 8 and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, for the units place, the number of times 4 appears is equal to the number of complete blocks of 10, and the same goes for 8. But I also need to consider any remaining numbers beyond the last complete block.\n\nWait, but since the book has 488 pages, which is 48 blocks of 10 (480 pages) plus 8 more pages (481-488). So, for the units place, in each block of 10, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). Therefore, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 488 is included, so 488 has an 8 in the units place, so yes, that's correct.\n\nNow moving on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every 10 numbers. For example, from 1-10, the tens digit is 0 (since it's 01-10, but we usually don't write the leading zero, so the tens digit is 0 for 1-9 and 1 for 10). Wait, no, actually, in page numbers, 1 is just 1, 10 is 10, so the tens digit for 1-9 is 0, but we don't write it, so maybe I should think differently. Let me think in terms of how many times each digit appears in the tens place.\n\nEach digit from 0 to 9 appears in the tens place for exactly 10 consecutive numbers. For example, 0 appears in the tens place for 1-9 (but as leading zeros, which we don't count), so maybe I should adjust for that. Wait, maybe it's better to think that for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, ..., 9 for 90-99. So, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n\nBut since our book goes up to 488, which is less than 500, we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each, so each digit appears 10 times per hundred. Therefore, for 4 full hundreds, that's 4 times 10, so 40 times each for digits 0-9 in the tens place. Now, for the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place here?\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit is 0, so that's 10 numbers, so 0 appears 10 times.\nFrom 411-420: tens digit is 1, so 10 times.\n...\nUp to 480-488: tens digit is 8, but there are only 9 numbers here (480-488). Wait, 480 is included, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in this partial hundred.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times do they appear?\n\n- Tens digit 0: 401-410: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 1: 411-420: 10\n- Tens digit 2: 421-430: 10\n- Tens digit 3: 431-440: 10\n- Tens digit 4: 441-450: 10\n- Tens digit 5: 451-460: 10\n- Tens digit 6: 461-470: 10\n- Tens digit 7: 471-480: 10\n- Tens digit 8: 480-488: 9 numbers\n\nSo, for the tens place in 401-488, each digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times. Therefore, the total number of times each digit appears in the tens place across the entire book is:\n\nFor digits 0-9 in the tens place:\n\n- For the first 400 pages (4 hundreds), each digit appears 40 times (4*10).\n- Then, in 401-488, digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, for 4's in the tens place: 40 (from first 400 pages) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: 40 (from first 400 pages) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. In the first 400 pages, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 more times, making it 50 for 4. For 8, in the tens place, in 401-488, it's only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more, making it 49 for 8.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. When considering the tens digit, in the range 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8. So, the number of times 4 appears in the tens place in this range is 10 (from 441-450), and 8 appears 9 times (from 480-488). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- 1 appears 100 times (100-199)\n- 2 appears 100 times (200-299)\n- 3 appears 100 times (300-399)\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89)\n- 0,5,6,7,8,9 don't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place:\n\n- Number of 4's: 89\n- Number of 8's: 0 (since 800-899 isn't part of the book)\n\nWait, but 8's in the hundreds place would be 0 because the book ends at 488, so hundreds digit 8 never occurs.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's, so subtract 8's from 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- For 488 pages, the number of complete tens is 48 (since 48*10=480), and then 8 more pages (481-488). So, in each complete ten, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place, so 48 times each. Then, in the last 8 pages, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For the first 400 pages, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place. Then, in 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, 4's: 40 + 10 = 50; 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 appears 0 times. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about the hundreds place, I considered that 4 appears 89 times, which is correct, but I just want to make sure that I'm not missing any other occurrences of 4 or 8 in the hundreds place. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0. That's correct.\n\nAnother check: Let me think about how many times 4 appears in each place:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place in 401-488. I said that 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, but let me confirm. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which is 8, appearing 9 times. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's from 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place, it's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, yes, that adds up.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. When considering the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. But wait, 400 is included, right? So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to calculate the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n- There are 48 complete blocks (480 pages) and 8 additional pages (481-488).\n- 4's: 48 + 1 (from 484) = 49\n- 8's: 48 + 1 (from 488) = 49\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n- For the first 400 pages, each digit appears 40 times.\n- In 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n- 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n- 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, for the units place. In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, the number 4 is in the units place. Similarly, in 11-20, it's 14, and so on. \n\nNow, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 times 1 (from each set) plus any additional 4's in the extra numbers. Looking at 481-488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, there's one more 4 in the units place. Therefore, total 4's in units place = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit in the tens place cycles every 100 numbers. For each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, in 1-100, the numbers 40-49 have 4 in the tens place, which is 10 times. \n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 numbers (401-488). \n\nIn each of the 4 complete hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 ten times, but since we only go up to 488, let's see. The tens digit in 401-409 is 0, 410-419 is 1, 420-429 is 2, 430-439 is 3, 440-449 is 4, 450-459 is 5, 460-469 is 6, 470-479 is 7, 480-488 is 8. \n\nWait, so in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 more 4's in the tens place. So total 4's in tens place = 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n\nWait, but hold on, 401-488 is 88 numbers, which is 4 full tens (400-409, 410-419, etc.) up to 470-479, and then 480-488. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 10 more 4's in the tens place. So total 4's in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. Therefore, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400 is included, so from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 times the hundreds digit is 4. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high. Let me verify.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488, which is indeed 89 numbers. So, 89 4's there. The tens place: in each hundred, 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40, plus in 401-488, another 10 in 440-449, so 50 total. Units place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last 8 numbers (481-488), units digit 4 occurs once, so 49 total. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with units place. Similar to 4's, in each set of ten, the units digit is 8 once. So, how many complete tens are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, one more 8 in units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, tens place. In each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. \n\nThere are 4 complete hundreds in 488 pages: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0-9. Let's see how many times 8 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 401-488 range. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but hold on: 401-488 includes 401-409 (tens digit 0), 410-419 (tens digit 1), ..., 470-479 (tens digit 7), 480-488 (tens digit 8). So, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. Therefore, total 8's in tens place: 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, yes, 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 8's.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me verify that. Units: 49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all the counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal: 49+50=99; 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. I had 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40+10=50. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, in 401-488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. Plus 40 from the first 400, total 49.\n\nWait, but in the first 400, each hundred contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, it's 9 more, so 49 total. That's correct.\n\nUnits place for both 4 and 8: 49 each. So, 49+50+89=188 for 4's, and 49+49+0=98 for 8's.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again: in the hundreds place for 4's, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. That's correct.\n\nIn the units place for 4's: from 1-488, every 10 numbers contribute 1, so 48 full tens, plus in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit 4 occurs once, so 49 total.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: same as 4's, 49.\n\nIn the tens place for 4's: 40 from the first 400, plus 10 from 440-449, so 50.\n\nIn the tens place for 8's: 40 from the first 400, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49.\n\nSo, yes, 188 4's and 98 8's, difference is 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in each set of ten numbers. So, for example, in 1-10, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. But wait, actually, 0 doesn't appear in the units place for 1-10 because the units digits are 1-0. Hmm, maybe I should think differently.\n\nWait, actually, in every block of ten numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place every ten numbers. But in our case, the page numbers go up to 488, so I need to figure out how many complete blocks of ten there are and then handle any remaining numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers.\n\nLet me structure this:\n\n1. Units place: For each position from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Similarly for 8.\n\n2. Tens place: How many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Similarly for 8.\n\n3. Hundreds place: How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Similarly for 8.\n\nThen, sum up the counts for each digit and find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the units place.\n\nUnits place:\n\nEach digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers. So, in 1-10, 4 appears once (at 4), 8 appears once (at 8). Then, in 11-20, 4 appears once (at 14), 8 appears once (at 18). This pattern continues.\n\nBut since our upper limit is 488, which is not a multiple of 10, I need to calculate how many complete tens there are and then handle the remaining numbers.\n\nTotal number of pages: 488.\n\nNumber of complete tens: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete tens, and 8 extra numbers (from 481 to 488).\n\nWait, actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so 48 complete tens (1-480) and then 481-488, which is 8 numbers.\n\nBut wait, actually, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so yes, 48 complete tens and 8 extra numbers.\n\nSo, in each complete ten, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, for 48 complete tens, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the same for 8's.\n\nNow, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in this partial set, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488).\n\nTherefore, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTotal 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So yes, adding 1 to each count.\n\nSo, units place: 49 fours and 49 eights.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nTens place:\n\nSimilarly, each digit from 0-9 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers. For example, 0 appears in 1-9 (but actually, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, but in terms of counting, we can consider it as 0). Wait, perhaps it's better to think that in each block of 100 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me think again. For the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each block of 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 ten times each. Similarly, from 100-199, the tens digit cycles again 0-9 ten times each, and so on.\n\nBut our total is 488, which is less than 500. So, let's break it down.\n\nTotal number of pages: 488.\n\nNumber of hundreds: 4 (since 400 is the hundreds place). Wait, actually, 488 is in the 400s, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4.\n\nBut for the tens place, let's calculate how many times each digit appears.\n\nEach digit in the tens place appears 10 times for each hundred. So, for each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, ..., 401-488), the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each.\n\nWait, but 488 is not a full hundred, so the last block is 401-488, which is 88 numbers.\n\nSo, first, let's calculate complete hundreds. From 1-300, that's three complete hundreds. Then, 301-400 is the fourth hundred, and 401-488 is the partial hundred.\n\nWait, actually, 1-100: hundreds digit is 0 (if considering 0-99), but in our case, page numbers start at 1, so 1-99, then 100-199, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of hundreds:\n\n- Pages 1-99: two-digit numbers, so hundreds digit is 0, but we can ignore that since we're only considering the tens and units digits.\n\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1.\n\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2.\n\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3.\n\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\nIn each hundred block (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.), the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each, so 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, from 101-200, same thing: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\nSame for 201-300 and 301-400.\n\nNow, for 401-488, which is 88 pages, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is 48-8). So, let's see:\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit is 0.\n\n411-420: tens digit is 1.\n\n421-430: tens digit is 2.\n\n431-440: tens digit is 3.\n\n441-450: tens digit is 4.\n\n451-460: tens digit is 5.\n\n461-470: tens digit is 6.\n\n471-480: tens digit is 7.\n\n481-488: tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 10 numbers (401-410), 1 for 10 (411-420), 2 for 10 (421-430), 3 for 10 (431-440), 4 for 10 (441-450), 5 for 10 (451-460), 6 for 10 (461-470), 7 for 10 (471-480), and 8 for 8 numbers (481-488).\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers.\n\nSo, in the tens place for 401-488:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times (441-450).\n\n- 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n\nTherefore, for the tens place:\n\nEach complete hundred (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) contributes 10 fours and 10 eights.\n\nThere are four such hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400.\n\nSo, 4 hundreds * 10 = 40 fours and 40 eights.\n\nThen, in 401-488, we have an additional 10 fours and 8 eights.\n\nSo, total fours in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal eights in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, but wait, 401-488 is part of the 400s, which is the fifth hundred? Or is it considered part of the 400-488 range? Hmm, perhaps I need to adjust.\n\nWait, actually, from 1-400, we have four complete hundreds, each contributing 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. Then, from 401-488, which is 88 pages, we have the tens digits as I calculated: 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, total fours in tens place: 4*10 +10=50.\n\nTotal eights in tens place:4*10 +8=48.\n\nWait, but that seems correct because in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (441-450) and 8 for 8 numbers (481-488).\n\nSo, yes, 50 fours and 48 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nThe hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, total fours in hundreds place:89.\n\nTotal eights in hundreds place:0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit.\n\nTotal fours:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:50\n\nHundreds place:89\n\nTotal fours=49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal eights:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:48\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal eights=49+48+0=97.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total eights from total fours:188-97=91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n48 complete tens:48 fours and 48 eights.\n\nRemaining 8 numbers (481-488): units digits 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once.\n\nTotal units fours:48+1=49.\n\nTotal units eights:48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach of the four complete hundreds (1-400) contributes 10 fours and 10 eights.\n\nSo, 4*10=40 fours, 4*10=40 eights.\n\nThen, in 401-488, tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (441-450) and 8 for 8 numbers (481-488).\n\nSo, tens fours:40+10=50.\n\nTens eights:40+8=48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n\n8 appears 0 times.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal eights:49+48+0=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (441-450) and 8 for 8 numbers (481-488). So, that adds 10 fours and 8 eights.\n\nWait, but 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for those 8 numbers, which is correct.\n\nSo, I think the calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97, so there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just check if I considered all page numbers correctly.\n\nWait, in the tens place, for 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8, but only up to 488. So, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 eights in the tens place. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, when the tens digit is 4, it's from 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours in the tens place.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to check is to calculate the total number of digits printed, but that might not be necessary here. I think the approach is correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. Subtracting these gives 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll break this down by the number of digits in the page numbers.\n\nFirst, single-digit page numbers: 1-9. In this range, the digit 4 appears exactly once, which is on page 4.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: 10-99. Here, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place.\n\nFor the tens place: The numbers 40-49 all have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nFor the units place: The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, starting from 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but since we're only going up to 99, the last one is 94. Let me count these: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers. So, 9 times the digit 4 appears in the units place.\n\nWait, but wait, 44 has a 4 in both tens and units place. So when I count the tens place, I included 44, and when I count the units place, I included 44 as well. So, in total, for two-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times.\n\nWait, but 44 is being counted twice, once in the tens and once in the units. But when we're counting digits, each occurrence is counted separately, so that's correct. So, 19 times in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100-488. This is a bit more complex because there are more places to consider: hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nIn the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears only in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers: I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens digit across all three-digit page numbers.\n\nFor each hundred range (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.\n\nBut wait, for the 400-488 range, the tens digit can go up to 8, so for the tens digit, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, except the last one, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times.\n\nWait, but let's check:\n\n- 100-199: tens digit 4 is from 140-149, which is 10 numbers.\n- 200-299: 240-249, 10 numbers.\n- 300-399: 340-349, 10 numbers.\n- 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, since 449 is less than 488.\n\nSo, that's 10 numbers in each hundred, and there are 4 hundreds, so 4 times 10 is 40. But wait, 400-488 is only up to 488, but 440-449 is within that, so yes, 10 numbers. So, total 40 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, but the tens digit 4 appears 10 times in 440-449, so that's correct.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers: Again, for each hundred, the units digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the units place once every 10 numbers, so 10 times per hundred.\n\nSo, for each hundred:\n\n- 100-199: 104,114,124,...,194: 10 numbers.\n- 200-299: 204,214,...,294: 10 numbers.\n- 300-399: 304,314,...,394: 10 numbers.\n- 400-488: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Wait, from 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nLet me count: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. So, 9 times in the units place for the 400-488 range.\n\nWait, but wait: 400-488 includes 488, but 488 is 4-8-8, so the units digit is 8, not 4. So, the last number with a 4 in the units place is 484. So, from 400-488, the units digit 4 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 10 times. Hmm, let me check. 404 is the first, then every 10 numbers: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the ninth, and the next would be 494, which is beyond 488. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, for the units place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-199: 10\n- 200-299: 10\n- 300-399: 10\n- 400-488: 9\n\nTotal units digit 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that for each hundred, except the last one, the units digit 4 appears 10 times, and for the last hundred (400-488), it appears 9 times because 488 is the last page. So, 3 hundreds with 10 each, and one with 9, totaling 39.\n\nSo, total units digit 4's in three-digit numbers: 39.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: hundreds place 89, tens place 40, units place 39. So, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n\nSo total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Single-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:168. So, 1+19=20, 20+168=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nAgain, I'll break it down by digit places: single-digit, two-digit, three-digit.\n\nSingle-digit page numbers: 1-9. The digit 8 appears once, on page 8.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers: 10-99.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place from 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nUnits place: The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers because from 10-99, the last one is 98. Wait, 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98: that's 9 numbers. So, 9 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but 88 has an 8 in both tens and units place, so it's counted twice, which is correct.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nNow, three-digit page numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digits are 1,2,3,4. So, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: Now, in the tens digit across all three-digit numbers, how many times does 8 appear?\n\nFor each hundred range:\n\n- 100-199: 180-189, which is 10 numbers.\n- 200-299: 280-289, 10 numbers.\n- 300-399: 380-389, 10 numbers.\n- 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 for these 9 numbers.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\n- 100-199: 10\n- 200-299: 10\n- 300-399: 10\n- 400-488: 9\n\nTotal tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nUnits place: Now, how many times does 8 appear in the units place across three-digit numbers?\n\nFor each hundred range:\n\n- 100-199: 108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198. That's 10 numbers.\n- 200-299: 208,218,...,298. 10 numbers.\n- 300-399: 308,318,...,398. 10 numbers.\n- 400-488: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Let's count these: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included, so the last one is 488.\n\nSo, units place 8's:\n\n- 100-199:10\n- 200-299:10\n- 300-399:10\n- 400-488:9\n\nTotal units place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but let me check the 400-488 range again. From 400-488, the units digit 8 appears in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, correct.\n\nSo, total units place 8's: 39.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit: tens place 39 + units place 39 = 78.\n\nWait, no: in three-digit numbers, the 8's in tens place are 39 and in units place are 39, so total 78.\n\nSo, total 8's: 1 (single-digit) +19 (two-digit) +78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 1 +19=20, 20+78=98.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double count. No, because single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit are separate. So, 1 +19 +78=98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the three-digit tens place was 39 and units place was 39, so 78. Then, single-digit 1, two-digit 19: total 1+19=20, plus 78=98.\n\nSo, total 8's:98.\n\nWait, but let me check the three-digit counts again because I might have made a mistake.\n\nIn three-digit numbers, for the tens place, I had 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9, totaling 39. Similarly, units place: same as tens place, 39. So, 39+39=78. So, 78 in three-digit numbers.\n\nThen, adding single and two-digit:1+19=20, so total 20+78=98. So, 98 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the two-digit counts again. For two-digit numbers, the 8's: tens place 10 (80-89), units place 9 (18,28,...,98). So, 10+9=19. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's:98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nLet me go through the 4's again.\n\nSingle-digit:1 (page 4).\n\nTwo-digit: tens place 40-49:10 numbers, units place 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94:9 numbers. So, 10+9=19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place:400-488:89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTens place:140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449:10 each, so 4*10=40.\n\nUnits place:104,114,...,194:10; 204,...,294:10; 304,...,394:10; 404,414,...,484:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168.\n\nTotal 4's:1+19+168=188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1 (page8).\n\nTwo-digit:80-89:10; 18,28,...,98:9. Total 19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nTens place:180-189:10; 280-289:10; 380-389:10; 480-488:9. So, 39.\n\nUnits place:108,118,...,198:10; 208,...,298:10; 308,...,398:10; 408,...,488:9. So, 39.\n\nTotal three-digit 8's:39+39=78.\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering the units place, tens place, and hundreds place separately for both digits 4 and 8. I'll handle each digit position one by one.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** In the units place, the digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that's 48 full groups, each with one 4 in the units place, and then there's 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, that's 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** In the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each hundred has 10 instances where the tens digit is 4. Now, since the book has 488 pages, let's see how many full hundreds we have. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. In each of these 4 full hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4*10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Therefore, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding all these up for digit 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 times. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99, plus 89 (hundreds) is indeed 188. Hmm, but I feel like that might be a miscalculation. Let me double-check each part.\n\nUnits place: From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full groups, each giving one 4, so 48 times, plus the 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place is 49.\n\nTens place: In each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is another 10 times. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times.\n\nAdding them: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct for digit 4.\n\nNow, moving on to digit 8:\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 times, plus the 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place for 8 is 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers every 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. However, since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let's calculate this carefully.\n\nFirst, in the range 1-400, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each hundred has 10 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 times. Now, in the range 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 times.\n\nAdding up for digit 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times.\n\nWait, that's 98 times for 8. But let me double-check the tens place for 8.\n\nIn the tens place, each hundred from 1-100, 101-200, etc., up to 401-500, but since we only go to 488, the last hundred is 401-488. In each full hundred, the tens digit 8 occurs 10 times (e.g., 80-89 in 1-100, 180-189 in 101-200, etc.), so 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 times. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. Units place is 49, so total 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, comparing the counts: digit 4 appears 188 times, digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again for 8. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 times, plus the 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place is 49, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4 in the units place, it's the same calculation, 49 times.\n\nWait, but for 4 in the hundreds place, I had 89, which is correct.\n\nSo, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 49 times (once every 10 numbers, including 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 times (10 times per hundred for 4 hundreds, plus 10 in 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 times (pages 400-488).\n\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 times (once every 10 numbers, including 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 times (10 times per hundred for 4 hundreds, plus 9 in 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 times (no page numbers 800-899).\n\nTotal for 8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nFirst, for the units place: In every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14; and so on. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and an extra 8 pages. So, in each of these 48 blocks, there's one 4 in the units place, giving me 48 fours. Then, in the last partial block (pages 481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, the units digit 4 appears once here as well (page 484). So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, in each block of 100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49 in the first hundred, 140-149 in the second, etc.). Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? That's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and an additional 88 pages (401-488). So, in each of the 4 hundreds, there are 10 fours in the tens place, giving 4*10 = 40 fours. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 appears once in the 40s, which is pages 401-410, but wait, no, that's the hundreds digit. Wait, no, the tens digit in 401-488 would be from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in pages 440-449. So, that's 10 fours in the tens place. So, adding that, we have 40 + 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but hold on, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, does the tens digit reach 4? Yes, because 488 is beyond 440. So, pages 440-449 have the tens digit as 4, which is 10 pages. So, yes, that's 10 more fours, making it 50 in total for the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the pages 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these 89 pages. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 pages. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my math again. Units place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1 four, so 48. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), units digit 4 appears once, so 48 + 1 = 49. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 more, making 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 fours. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to fours, in each block of 10, the units digit 8 appears once. So, 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing 1 eight, so 48. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears once here as well (page 488). So, total units place eights: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: In each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for 4 full hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 eights. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in pages 480-489, but since our book ends at 488, it's pages 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times, but wait, 480-489 is 10 pages, but we only go up to 488, so it's 9 pages? Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, but the units digit varies. So, the tens digit is 8 for each of these 9 pages, so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again. In the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 8, it's from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 pages: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 for each of these 9 pages, so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens eights: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place eights: 0.\n\nSo, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. So, total 98 eights.\n\nWait, but earlier, for fours, we had 188 fours, and for eights, 98 eights. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the counts because 90 seems like a big difference, and I might have made a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me recount the fours:\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens (1-480), each contributing 1 four in units place, so 48. Then, 481-488: units digits go from 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place (40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, 4 hundreds give 4*10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 more, making 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, eights:\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens (1-480), each contributing 1 eight, so 48. Then, 481-488: units digits go from 1-8, so 8 appears once (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 eights in the tens place (80-89, etc.). So, 4 hundreds give 4*10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488), so 9 eights. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot. Let me see if I can find another way to calculate this, maybe by using a formula or a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each digit position separately and calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) = 48, plus if the remainder is >=4, add 1. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is exactly 8, so 48 +1=49.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100) =4, each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, the remainder is 88. The tens digit in the remainder part (0-88) cycles through 0-8. So, the tens digit 4 appears once in 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, total 40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's: floor(488/100)=4, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. The remainder is 88. The tens digit 8 appears in 80-88, which is 9 numbers (since 88 is included), so 9 eights. So, total 40 +9=49.\n\nFor hundreds digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/1000)=0, but since we're dealing with hundreds, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nFor 8's: hundreds digit 8 would be 800-899, but since we only go up to 488, there are 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188.\n\nTotal eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n\nBut wait, let me check another way. Maybe I can list out the counts for smaller numbers and see if the pattern holds.\n\nFor example, let's say we have a 10-page book. How many fours and eights?\n\nPages 1-10.\n\nFours: page 4 \u2192 1 four.\n\nEights: page 8 \u21921 eight.\n\nDifference: 0.\n\nBut according to my method:\n\nUnits place: floor(10/10)=1, remainder 0, so 1 four, 1 eight.\n\nTens place: floor(10/100)=0, so 0 for both.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, fours:1, eights:1, difference 0. Correct.\n\nAnother example: 20 pages.\n\nFours: pages 4,14 \u2192 2 fours.\n\nEights: pages 8,18 \u21922 eights.\n\nDifference:0.\n\nUsing my method:\n\nUnits: floor(20/10)=2, remainder 0, so 2 fours, 2 eights.\n\nTens: floor(20/100)=0, so 0.\n\nTotal fours:2, eights:2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: 50 pages.\n\nFours: units:5 (4,14,24,34,44), tens:5 (40-49), total 10 fours.\n\nEights: units:5 (8,18,28,38,48), tens:5 (48-48? Wait, 40-49 is tens digit 4, so in tens place, eights would be 80-89, but 50 pages only go up to 50, so tens digit 8 doesn't appear. Wait, no, 50 pages: tens digit 8 would be in 80-89, which is beyond 50, so only units digit eights:5.\n\nSo, fours:10, eights:5. Difference:5.\n\nUsing my method:\n\nUnits fours: floor(50/10)=5, remainder 0 \u21925.\n\nTens fours: floor(50/100)=0, but in 1-50, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 pages, so 10 fours.\n\nHundreds:0.\n\nTotal fours:5+10=15? Wait, but earlier I thought it was 10. Wait, no, in 1-50, fours in units:5, tens:10 (40-49), so total 15 fours.\n\nEights: units:5 (8,18,28,38,48), tens:0, since 50 <80.\n\nSo, eights:5.\n\nDifference:15-5=10.\n\nWait, but when I manually counted, I thought fours were 10, but according to this, it's 15. Wait, I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me recount.\n\nIn 1-50:\n\nFours: units digits:4,14,24,34,44 \u21925.\n\nTens digits:40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49 \u219210.\n\nTotal fours:15.\n\nEights: units digits:8,18,28,38,48 \u21925.\n\nTens digits: none, since 50 <80.\n\nSo, eights:5.\n\nDifference:15-5=10.\n\nSo, my method works here, giving a difference of 10, which is correct.\n\nSo, going back, in the original problem, the difference is 90, which seems correct based on the method.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, for the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and a partial group of 8 numbers (481-488). In each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, 48 groups \u00d7 1 = 48 times. Now, in the partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once in 484. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each cycle of 100 has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 4 (40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds. Each of these contributes 10 times the digit 4 in the tens place. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (400-488), the tens digit is 4 from 440-449. That's 10 more times. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, each group of 10 has one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48 \u00d7 1 = 48. The partial group from 481-488 has units digits 1-8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total 8's in units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each hundred contributes 10 such numbers. There are 4 complete hundreds, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (400-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, total 4's are 188 and total 8's are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 complete groups of 10 (48 \u00d7 1) + 1 in the partial group = 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 complete hundreds (4 \u00d7 10) + 10 in the remaining 88 pages = 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences from 400-488.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 complete groups of 10 (48 \u00d7 1) + 1 in the partial group = 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 complete hundreds (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 in the remaining 88 pages = 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, for the units place. In the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). \n\nIn each block of 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles through 0-9. So, for each block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for 8. Therefore, in 48 complete blocks, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48. \n\nNow, for the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the total number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is included, so maybe I should check that again. \n\nWait, 488 is the last page, so the units digits from 481 to 488 are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So yes, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8.\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, for 4 full hundreds, the number of 4's in the tens place is 4 * 10 = 40, and similarly for 8's, it's also 40. \n\nNow, for the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? It appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). \n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, in the tens place for 401-488, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times. \n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 = 50, and the total number of 8's is 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check again. The partial hundred is 401-488, which is 88 pages. The tens digit cycles every 10 pages. So, from 401-410, tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit is 1; and so on up to 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 488 is the end). So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, yes, 10 times for 4 and 9 times for 8 in the tens place for the partial hundred. \n\nSo, total tens place: 4's = 40 + 10 = 50; 8's = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\nFor the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, total hundreds place: 4's = 89; 8's = 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems a bit high, and I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the units place. From 1 to 488, each block of 10 has one 4 and one 8 in the units place. There are 48 complete blocks (1-480), so 48 each of 4's and 8's. Then, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units: 48 +1=49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, 10 times each digit in the tens place. So, 4 full hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40 for 4's and 40 for 8's. Then, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, 440-449 is 10 times for 4's, and 480-488 is 9 times for 8's. So, tens: 4's=40+10=50; 8's=40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 4's appear 89 times (400-488), and 8's never appear in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)= 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). Each complete set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the incomplete set (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more in 484. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in every block of 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). In each complete hundred, there's one block where the tens digit is 4, each contributing 10 4's. So that's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 0 in 401-409, 1 in 410-419, ..., up to 8 in 480-488. The tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's another 10 numbers, so 10 more 4's. So total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Because from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, so each of those 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. So 89 4's there.\n\nWait, but let me add again: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. So 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So total 4's are 188.\n\nNow, moving on to counting the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with units place: For every set of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, similar to the 4's, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the incomplete set (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each of these blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds, each contributing one block of 10 8's. So that's 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, so in 480-488, that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So that's 9 more 8's. So total 8's in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but hold on. From 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-409) to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 8's in the tens place in the incomplete hundred. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's there.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so total 4's are 188 and total 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when I count digit positions, I might have missed something.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: For every 10 numbers, one 4. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once. So total 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: For every 100 numbers, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 more. So total 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: Same as 4's, 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 8 appears once in 488. So total 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: For every 100 numbers, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (80-89, 180-189, etc.). 4 full hundreds, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 9 more. So total 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: As the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can think of another way to count. Alternatively, I can count the number of 4's and 8's separately in each digit position.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: As above, 49.\n\n- Tens: 50.\n\n- Hundreds: 89.\n\nTotal: 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49.\n\n- Tens: 49.\n\n- Hundreds: 0.\n\nTotal: 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, another way to check: Let's consider how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFor 4's: floor(488/10) = 48, plus if the last digit is >=4, add 1 if the remainder is >=4. Wait, 488 mod 10 is 8, which is greater than 4, so add 1. So 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for 8's: floor(488/10) = 48, and since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is equal to 8, so add 1. So 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's: floor(488/100) = 4, each contributing 10, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, the last partial hundred is 488 - 400 = 88. So, how many tens digits of 4 in 401-488? The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. So total 40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly for 8's: floor(488/100)=4, each contributing 10, so 4\u00d710=40. Last partial hundred: 488-400=88.

So 89.\n\nFor 8's: Hundreds digit is 8 from 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, none.

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. For each place, I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For any digit, in each block of 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits go from 1 to 0. But wait, actually, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit appears once every 10 numbers. \n\nSo, for the units place, the number of times a digit appears is equal to the number of complete blocks of 10 in the range plus any extra numbers if the total isn't a multiple of 10. \n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, each digit appears 10 times in a block of 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n\nFor the hundreds place, each digit appears 100 times in a block of 1000 numbers. But since our book only has 488 pages, we'll need to adjust for that.\n\nWait, but since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit will only be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Specifically, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, from 100-199 it's 1, 200-299 it's 2, 300-399 it's 3, and 400-488 it's 4.\n\nSo, let's structure this by each digit place.\n\nFirst, let's handle the units place for both 4 and 8.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place: How many times does 4 appear in the units digit from 1 to 488?\n\nEach block of 10 numbers contributes one 4. So, the number of complete blocks of 10 in 488 is 48 (since 48*10=480), and then there are 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each block, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48 times, plus in the last partial block, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so no 4. So total 4's in units place: 48.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in units place: Each block of 10 contributes one 8. So, 48 complete blocks, so 48 eights, and in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so one 8 (which is 488). So total 8's in units place: 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. The last block is from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers. The units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So yes, 48 from the complete blocks and 1 from the last partial block, totaling 49.\n\nWait, but wait: 488 is page 488, so in the units place, 8 appears once. So, correct, 49 eights in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of 4's in the tens place: Each time the tens digit is 4, which occurs in blocks of 100. For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. Similarly, in 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is a complete block, but 480-488 is another partial block where the tens digit is 8, so 4's in the tens place would be in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n\nEach of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there?\n\nFrom 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each.\n\nSo, in 1-99, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49). Similarly, in 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. 400-488: 440-449, another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's. So total 5*10=50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 40-49: 10 numbers, 40-49 inclusive, so 10 4's in tens place. Similarly, each subsequent hundred has another 10, so 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 88 numbers, but the tens digit from 400-488: 400-409 has tens digit 0, 410-419:1, 420-429:2, 430-439:3, 440-449:4, then 450-459:5, 460-469:6, 470-479:7, 480-488:8. So, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 10 4's in the tens place here. So total 5*10=50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, number of 8's in the tens place: Similarly, each block where the tens digit is 8 contributes 10 8's. So, in 1-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. In 100-199: 180-189, another 10. 200-299: 280-289, another 10. 300-399: 380-389, another 10. 400-488: 480-488, which is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place here.\n\nWait, let me count: 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, yes, 9 8's in the tens place in the last block. So total 8's in tens place: 10 (from 80-89) +10 (180-189)+10 (280-289)+10 (380-389) +9 (480-488) = 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for each of these, so 9 8's. So total 10+10+10+10+9=49 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, so far, units place: 48 4's and 49 8's.\n\nTens place: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's in the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the pages 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 +1 =89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNumber of 8's in the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with hundreds digit 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but wait: 488 is less than 800, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, now, let's sum up all the 4's and 8's.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\nUnits place:48\n\nTens place:50\n\nHundreds place:89\n\nTotal 4's =48+50+89= 187.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:49\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal 8's=49+49+0=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 -98=89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n4's:48, 8's:49.\n\nTens place:\n\n4's:50, 8's:49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nSo, total 4's:48+50=98 +89=187.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\n187-98=89.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's, we had 5 blocks each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, we had 4 full blocks (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40, plus the last partial block 480-488 contributing 9 8's, so total 40+9=49.\n\nUnits place: For 4's, 48 times, and 8's 49 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:48+50+89=187.\n\n8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:187-98=89.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Identify the Range:**\n   - Page numbers range from 1 to 488.\n\n2. **Analyze Each Digit Place Separately:**\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - **Count of '4's:** Each block of 10 numbers contributes one '4'. There are 48 complete blocks (1-480), and in the last 8 numbers (481-488), there's no '4'. So, 48 '4's.\n     - **Count of '8's:** Similarly, 48 '8's from complete blocks, plus one '8' in 488. Total: 49 '8's.\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - **Count of '4's:** Each hundred block (e.g., 40-49) contributes 10 '4's. There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), totaling 50 '4's.\n     - **Count of '8's:** Each hundred block contributes 10 '8's, except the last block (480-488), which contributes 9 '8's. Total: 49 '8's.\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - **Count of '4's:** Pages 400-488 contribute 89 '4's.\n     - **Count of '8's:** None, as the book ends at 488.\n\n3. **Summarize the Counts:**\n   - **Total '4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference:**\n   - 187 (total '4's) - 98 (total '8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe digit '4' appears 89 more times than the digit '8' in the page numbers.  \nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{89}."

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, for the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. Now, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups and then 8 more numbers. In each complete group, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 fours. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears once more. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit changes every 10 numbers. So, for example, from 1-9, the tens digit is 0, from 10-19 it's 1, 20-29 it's 2, and so on. Now, in each block of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). So, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40 fours. Now, the last partial hundred is 401-488. In this range, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, 2 for 421-430, 3 for 431-440, 4 for 441-450, and then 5-8 for 451-488. Wait, no, actually, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 for 481-488). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? It would be in 441-450, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 fours. So total fours in the tens place would be 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 (from the partial hundred) = 50 fours.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure. From 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, from 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10, and so on. So, for each hundred, it's 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that adds 10 more, making it 50. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but is that correct? Because each number from 400-488 has 4 in the hundreds place. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, total fours would be the sum of fours in units, tens, and hundreds places. So, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Adding them up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours printed are 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I need to count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places in the page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nStarting with units place. Similar to fours, in each group of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 eights. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more. So, total eights in units place: 48 +1=49.\n\nNext, the tens place. In each block of 100 numbers, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for each hundred, that's 10 eights. How many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). So, 4*10=40 eights. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 in 9 numbers. So, that's 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 starting at 480. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, yes, 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total eights would be units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, so total 98 eights.\n\nSo, now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Let me go through each step again.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units place: 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing 1 four, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), units digit 4 appears once, so total 49.\n- Tens place: 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 fours, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, making 50.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\nTotal fours: 49 +50 +89 = 188.\n\nFor eights:\n- Units place: 48 complete groups, each contributing 1 eight, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers, 481-488, units digit 8 appears once, so total 49.\n- Tens place: 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 eights, so 40. Then, in 401-488, tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more, making 49.\n- Hundreds place: 0, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\nTotal eights: 49 +49 +0 =98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nHmm, seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly for fours. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. So, each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. That seems right.\n\nAnd for the tens place in fours, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, 40 (from the four complete hundreds) +10=50.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights, in the tens place, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40 +9=49.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** In every block of 10 numbers, '4' appears once. There are 48 complete blocks (1-480) contributing 48 fours. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) add one more '4', totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** In every block of 100 numbers, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place. Four complete blocks (1-400) contribute 40 fours. The range 401-488 adds another 10 fours (440-449), totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, '4' appears in the hundreds place for 89 numbers.\n   - **Total Fours:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to '4', '8' appears 49 times.\n   - **Tens Place:** In every block of 100, '8' appears 10 times.

I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units digit across all page numbers. For each set of ten consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9.

Similarly, pages 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 contribute an 8 in the units place.\n\nBut wait, the book ends at page 488, which is a three-digit number. So, I need to make sure I don't go beyond that when counting. Let me calculate how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488 pages. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488). \n\nSo, in each complete set of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Therefore, for 48 complete sets, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the same for 8's. Now, looking at the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). \n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\nTotal 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the difference here is zero. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here because I thought maybe 8 would have one more, but no, both have the same in the units place.\n\nWait, let me double-check. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? For each ten, it's once, so 48 times, plus in the last 8 pages, 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, 8 appears once every ten, so 48 times, and in the last 8 pages, 488 is the only one with an 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49. So, yes, units place gives both 4 and 8 a count of 49. So, the difference in units place is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. Here, the digit 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Similarly, 8 can appear in the tens place like 80-89, 180-189, etc. I need to count how many times each appears in the tens place across all page numbers.\n\nLet me think about how often each digit appears in the tens place. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times per hundred. Since our book goes up to 488, which is less than 500, we have four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488.\n\nWait, actually, page 1 is page 1, so the hundreds digit starts from 0 for pages 1-99, then 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, etc.\n\nBut I'm focusing on the tens place. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the digit 8 appears 10 times as well.\n\nNow, how many full hundreds do we have? From 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. That's four full hundreds. So, for each of these, the tens digit 4 and 8 each appear 10 times. So, for 4, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times, and same for 8, 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, what about the last partial hundred, 401-488? The tens digit here goes from 0 to 8, but only up to 488. Let me see. Pages 401-488: the tens digit cycles from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490). But since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in 401-488?\n\nFor the digit 4 in the tens place: in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. So, that's 10 pages, right? Wait, 440-449 is 10 pages, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, 10 times.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is 10 pages, so the tens digit 4 appears 10 times here. So, that's another 10 for 4 in the tens place.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the tens place: in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. Wait, but 480-489 is 10 pages, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 pages. So, the digit 8 in the tens place appears 9 times here.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since our book ends at 488, the pages with tens digit 8 are 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred.\n\nSo, total for the tens place:\n\nDigit 4: 4 full hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in 401-488, so total 50.\n\nDigit 8: 4 full hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 9 in 401-488, so total 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. So, the difference here is 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, in the first four hundreds (1-400), each hundred contributes 10 times for both 4 and 8 in the tens place, so 40 each. Then, in 401-488, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. So, yes, that's correct. So, the tens place gives 4 being more by 1.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8? Does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Well, the book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8's count in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each place:\n\n- Units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49 \u2192 difference 0\n- Tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49 \u2192 difference +1\n- Hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0 \u2192 difference +89\n\nSo, total difference is 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- From 1 to 488, every 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, 48 complete sets of 10, which is 48 times each, plus in the last 8 pages (481-488), 484 has a 4 and 488 has an 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49 for both. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For each hundred, 10 times each digit in the tens place. So, 4 full hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10 = 40 for each digit. Then, in 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. Difference of 1. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place. So, 89 - 0 = 89. Correct.\n\nAdding up the differences: 0 (units) +1 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 90.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility I overcounted somewhere? Let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. For 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, yes, 10 vs 9, difference of 1.\n\nUnits place is balanced, so no difference there.\n\nSo, total difference is 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place Analysis:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 pages in the units place.\n   - Total complete sets of 10 pages in 488 pages: 48 sets.\n   - Each digit appears 48 times in the units place.\n   - In the last 8 pages (481-488), 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n   - **Difference in units place:** 49 - 49 = 0\n\n2. **Tens Place Analysis:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n   - Four full hundreds (1-400) contribute 10 times each for 4 and 8.\n   - **Total in four hundreds:** 4 * 10 = 40 for both 4 and 8.\n   - In 401-488:\n     - 4 appears in 440-449 (10 times).\n     - 8 appears in 480-488 (9 times).\n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 40 + 10 = 50\n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 40 + 9 = 49\n   - **Difference in tens place:** 50 - 49 = +1\n\n3. **Hundreds Place Analysis:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89\n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0\n   - **Difference in hundreds place:** 89 - 0 = +89\n\n4. **Total Difference:**\n   - Summing the differences from each place: 0 (units) + 1 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each position, I'll calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, every 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). \n\nIn each complete set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. So, for the units digit, the number of 4's is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48. But wait, I have those extra 8 numbers from 481-488. Let me check the units digit in these. The numbers are 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The units digits here are 1 through 8. So, in these, the digit 8 appears once (in 488). Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the total number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. \n\nWait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. When I have 48 complete sets of 10, each contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, that's 48 each. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 8 appears once in the units place (488), and the digit 4 doesn't appear in the units place in these extra numbers because 484 is in the hundreds place. Wait, no, 484 has a 4 in the hundreds place, but the units digit is 4. Wait, 484 is part of the extra 8 numbers? No, 484 is page 484, which is within 481-488. Wait, no, 481-488 is 8 numbers: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, in these, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, the digit 4 appears once (in 484) and the digit 8 appears once (in 488). Therefore, for the units place, the total 4's are 48 +1 =49, and the total 8's are 48 +1=49. So, they are equal in the units place. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. Similarly, from 100-199, the tens digit cycles again, and so on.\n\nSo, for the tens place, let's calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nFirst, the total number of hundreds in 488 is 4 (since 488 is less than 500). So, from 1-488, we have 4 complete hundreds: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and then 400-488. Wait, actually, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, up to 399, we have four complete hundreds, and then 400-488 is another 89 pages.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many times each digit appears in the tens place across all page numbers.\n\nFor the tens digit, in each hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, ..., 9 for 90-99. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred.\n\nSo, for the first 400 pages (1-400), there are 4 complete hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, for 400 pages, the number of times 4 appears in the tens place is 4 *10 =40, and similarly for 8, it's 4*10=40.\n\nNow, from 401-488, we have 88 pages. Let's look at the tens digit in this range. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in the tens place. Wait, no, 401-488: the tens digit starts at 0 (for 401-410), then 1 (411-420), up to 8 (481-490), but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit for 481-488 is 8, but only 8 numbers (481-488). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 and 8 appear?\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410 (10 numbers), 1 for 411-420 (10), 2 for 421-430 (10), 3 for 431-440 (10), 4 for 441-450 (10), 5 for 451-460 (10), 6 for 461-470 (10), 7 for 471-480 (10), and 8 for 481-488 (8 numbers). \n\nSo, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears once in the tens place for 441-450, which is 10 times. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 481-488, which is 8 times. \n\nWait, but earlier, from 1-400, the tens digit 4 appeared 40 times, and 8 appeared 40 times. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 more times (in 441-450), and 8 appears 8 more times (in 481-488). So, total for the tens place: 4's = 40 +10=50, and 8's=40 +8=48.\n\nWait, let me verify that. From 1-400, each digit in the tens place appears 4*10=40 times. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times, so 40+10=50 for 4's. For 8's, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 times, so 40+8=48 for 8's. So, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 48. So, 4's have 2 more in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages.\n\nSo, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, so 4 and 8 don't appear here. From 200-299, the hundreds digit is 2, so again, 4 and 8 don't appear here. From 300-399, the hundreds digit is 3, so still no 4 or 8. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is either 1,2,3, or 4. Therefore, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total for the hundreds place: 4's =89, 8's=0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's =49+50+89= 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:48\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's=49+48+0=97.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. Therefore, the difference is 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 4's=48+1=49, 8's=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place: From 1-400, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place. So, 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 40 times. From 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 times. So, 4's tens:40+10=50, 8's tens:40+8=48. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 4's hundreds=89, 8's hundreds=0. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAnother way to think about the hundreds place: Each hundred block contributes 100 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, the last block is incomplete. But for the hundreds digit, each complete hundred (100-199, etc.) contributes 100 numbers with the same hundreds digit. So, 1-99: hundreds digit 0, 100-199:1, 200-299:2, 300-399:3, 400-488:4. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times, which is correct.\n\nAnother check: Let's calculate total number of digits printed. From 1-9:9 numbers, 1 digit each:9 digits.\n\nFrom 10-99:90 numbers, 2 digits each:180 digits.\n\nFrom 100-488:389 numbers, 3 digits each:1167 digits.\n\nTotal digits:9+180+1167=1356 digits.\n\nNow, total 4's:188, total 8's:97.\n\nSo, 188+97=285. But 1356 digits, so 188+97=285 is less than 1356, which makes sense because other digits also appear.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't overcount. For example, in page 444, the digit 4 appears three times, so it's counted three times in the total 4's count. Similarly, page 488 has two 8's: in the tens and units place, so it's counted twice in the 8's count.\n\nWait, no, in page 488, the digits are 4,8,8. So, the hundreds digit is 4, tens digit is 8, units digit is 8. So, in the 4's count, it's counted once (hundreds place), and in the 8's count, it's counted twice (tens and units). So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, page 444: hundreds, tens, units all 4's, so it's counted three times in the 4's total.\n\nSo, my calculation seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188-97=91.\n\nSo, there are 91 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n- Total complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 sets.\n- 48 sets contribute 48 4's and 48 8's.\n- Remaining 8 numbers (481-488) contribute 1 additional 4 (484) and 1 additional 8 (488).\n- **Total 4's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n- **Total 8's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n- From 1-400: 4 complete hundreds, contributing 40 4's and 40 8's.\n- From 401-488: Tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n- **Total 4's in tens place:** 40 + 10 = 50\n- **Total 8's in tens place:** 40 + 8 = 48\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- From 1-399: Hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3; no 4's or 8's.\n- From 400-488: Hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n- **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89\n- **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{91}"

So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place goes from 0 to 9.

Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). So, in each complete set, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48. But wait, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the units digit 4 appears once (484) and the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, adding that to our previous counts, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89). \n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an extra 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and the tens digit 8 appears 10 times. So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for 4's and 40 times for 8's in the tens place. \n\nNow, looking at the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, does that mean the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here? Let me check. From 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, but the units digit goes from 0 to 8. So, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the extra 88 pages. \n\nWait, but in the tens place, for the numbers 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times, and the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, adding to our previous counts, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50, and the number of 8's is 40 + 9 = 49. \n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me think again. From 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times except for the last digit, which might be less. Wait, no, actually, from 401 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 = 88 numbers. So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which is 8, appearing only 9 times because 488 is the last page. So, yes, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the 401-488 range. So, the total for the tens place is 40 (from the first 400 pages) plus 10 (for 440-449) for 4's, making 50. And for 8's, it's 40 (from the first 400 pages) plus 9 (from 480-488), making 49. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's zero. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1. From 200-299, it's 2. From 300-399, it's 3. From 400-488, it's 4. \n\nSo, the hundreds digit 4 appears from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. \n\nWhat about the hundreds digit 8? Well, in the range up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 because 800 would be page 800, which is beyond 488. So, the hundreds digit 8 doesn't appear at all. So, the count for 8's in the hundreds place is zero.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences of 4's and 8's across all digit positions.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, we subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4's and 8's. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) contribute 4 * 10 = 40 each. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place: 4's appear 89 times (400-488). 8's don't appear in the hundreds place here, so 0. So, total 4's: 89, 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nAdding up all 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I feel like 90 might be too high. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place.\n\nWait, from 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these 89 numbers, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nUnits place: 49 each, correct.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position again.\n\nAnother way: For each digit position, calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n- Total numbers: 488\n- Each digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place, except possibly the last set.\n- Number of complete groups of 10: 488 // 10 = 48, remainder 8.\n- So, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place.\n- Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so digits 1-8 each appear once more.\n- So, for 4: 48 (from complete groups) + 1 (from last 8) = 49.\n- For 8: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred.\n- Number of complete hundreds: 4 (1-400), each contributing 10 times for each digit.\n- So, for 4: 4 * 10 = 40.\n- For 8: 4 * 10 = 40.\n- Now, the remaining 88 numbers (401-488) have tens digits from 0-8.\n- Each tens digit from 0-8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which appears 9 times.\n- So, for 4: 10 times in 440-449.\n- For 8: 9 times in 480-488.\n- So, total for 4: 40 + 10 = 50.\n- Total for 8: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n- Only pages 100-488 have a hundreds digit.\n- From 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's.\n- From 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's.\n- From 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, same.\n- From 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, same.\n- From 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so 89 times (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n- So, 4's: 89, 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't double-count or miss any numbers.\n\nAnother approach: Let's count the number of 4's and 8's in each position for all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nUnits place:\n- As before, 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n- 50 for 4's, 49 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Analyze Each Digit Position:**\n   - **Units Place:** Count occurrences of 4 and 8.\n   - **Tens Place:** Count occurrences of 4 and 8.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** Count occurrences of 4 and 8.\n\n2. **Units Place Calculation:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place, cycling every 10 pages.\n   - Complete groups of 10: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 groups.\n   - Remainder: 88 \u00f7 10 = 8 extra pages (481-488).\n   - Each digit appears 48 times in complete groups.\n   - In the last 8 pages, digits 1-8 appear once each.\n   - **4's:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **8's:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n3. **Tens Place Calculation:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred.\n   - Complete hundreds: 4 (1-400).\n   - Each digit appears 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n     - Tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - Tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - **4's:** 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - **8's:** 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n4. **Hundreds Place Calculation:**\n   - Pages 1-99: Hundreds digit is 0; no 4's or 8's.\n   - Pages 100-399: Hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3; no 4's or 8's.\n   - Pages 400-488: Hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - **4's:** 89.\n   - **8's:** 0.\n\n5. **Total Counts:**\n   - **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n6. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each place for both 4 and 8 and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For each set of ten numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then checking if there's any remainder.\n\nBut wait, since 488 isn't a multiple of 10, I need to handle the last partial set separately. Let me think. The total number of complete sets of ten in 488 pages is 48 full sets (since 48*10=480), and then 8 more pages (481-488). \n\nSo, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 (from each set of ten) plus one more if the last partial set includes a 4. Looking at 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once in the units place. So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: Each full set of ten has one 8, so 48 times. The last partial set (481-488) includes 8 in the units place once (page 488). So total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the difference here is zero. But let me check if I did that correctly. For the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in each set of ten, so yes, 48 times for each digit, plus the last partial set. Since the last set ends at 488, which is an 8, so 8 appears once more, and 481-488 includes a 4 (page 484) and an 8 (page 488). So, yes, 49 each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, up to 9 for 90-99. Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, for the entire book, how many hundreds are there? 488 pages mean 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nSo, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (e.g., 40-49 in the first hundred, 140-149 in the second, etc.). Since there are 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for pages 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: Each hundred has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4*10=40. In the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. Wait, but actually, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we stop at 488, it's 480-488, so 9 pages. Wait, but in terms of the tens digit, 480-488 have 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 occurrences. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 pages where the tens digit is 8. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check again. Each full hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40. The last partial hundred is 401-488, which is 88 pages. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in this partial hundred. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place in the last partial hundred. So total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 10, but no, because we only go up to 488, not 489. So, it's 9. So, 49 total 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but for the 4's in the tens place, in the last partial hundred, we have 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 occurrences. So, 40 +10=50.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 49 times. So, the difference here is 50 - 49 = 1 more 4.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present in three-digit numbers, i.e., from page 100 onwards. The hundreds digit cycles every 1000 pages, but since we only have 488 pages, the hundreds digit goes from 1 to 4 (pages 100-199: hundreds digit 1; 200-299: 2; 300-399:3; 400-488:4).\n\nSo, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place? \n\n- 1 appears 100 times (100-199)\n- 2 appears 100 times (200-299)\n- 3 appears 100 times (300-399)\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488, which is 89 pages: 488 - 400 +1 = 89)\n\nWait, let me check: 400 to 488 is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, for the digit 8 in the hundreds place: since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, and 8's appear 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so yes, 89 times. And since the book doesn't go beyond 488, 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me sum up the occurrences of 4's and 8's across all digit places.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- For 4's: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the last 8 pages (481-488) where 4 appears once (page 484). So 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\n- For 8's: Similarly, 48 full tens, each contributing 1, plus the last 8 pages where 8 appears once (page 488). So 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 4's: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40, plus the last partial hundred (401-488) where 440-449 gives 10 more. So 40 +10=50. Correct.\n\n- For 8's: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40, plus the last partial hundred (401-488) where 480-488 gives 9 more. So 40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 times. Correct.\n\n- 8's: None, since 800-899 isn't included. So 0. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 +50 +89 = 188\n\n8's: 49 +49 +0 =98\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90\n\nWait, but I thought earlier the difference was 1 (from tens place) and 89 (from hundreds place), totaling 90. So that checks out.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Did I consider all the places correctly?\n\nYes, units, tens, and hundreds. Each digit place was handled separately, and the counts were added up.\n\nAnother way to think about it: For each digit place, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear, then sum across all places.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a more systematic approach to count the digits.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is floor((N +1)/10) + (if the last digit is >=d, add 1 else 0). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is equal to the number of complete decades (each contributing 1) plus 1 if the last partial decade includes d.\n\nWait, for units place:\n\nTotal units digits = floor(N /10) *1 + (if N%10 >=d then 1 else 0). But actually, for d=4 and d=8, it's similar.\n\nWait, but in our case, N=488.\n\nFor units digit 4:\n\nNumber of complete decades: floor(488/10)=48, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 in units place. Then, check the last partial decade: 481-488. The units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once. So total 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly for 8: same calculation, 48 +1=49.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the tens place up to N can be calculated as:\n\nFor each hundred, the digit d appears 10 times in the tens place. So, number of hundreds is floor(N /100). Each contributes 10 times. Then, check the remaining pages beyond the last complete hundred.\n\nFor N=488, number of hundreds is 4 (since 4*100=400, next would be 500 which is beyond 488). So, for d=4:\n\nIn each hundred, 10 times in tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, check the remaining pages: 401-488. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, total 40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly for d=8:\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 times, so 4*10=40.\n\nIn the remaining 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488). So, total 40 +9=49.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nNumber of times d appears in hundreds place up to N is:\n\nIf d is less than the hundreds digit of N, then it's 100 times for each digit. If d equals the hundreds digit, it's (N - (d*100) +1) times.\n\nWait, for N=488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, for d=4, it appears from 400 to 488, which is 488 -400 +1=89 times.\n\nFor d=8, since 8 >4, it doesn't appear in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89 \u2192 total=49+50+89=188\n\n8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0 \u2192 total=49+49+0=98\n\nDifference: 188-98=90\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again if I missed any edge cases. For example, in the tens place, when calculating the last partial hundred, did I correctly count the number of times 8 appears? From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 pages: 480,481,...,488. So that's 9 times, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4 in the tens place, 440-449 is 10 pages, correct.\n\nAnd in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 pages, correct.\n\nI think that's all correct. So, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each position for both 4's and 8's and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block, the digit 4 appears once (like 4,14,24,...) and the digit 8 appears once (like 8,18,28,...). So, for each complete block of 10, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. \n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 more pages (481-488). In each of these 48 blocks, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, that's 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, for the units place, both digits appear the same number of times. \n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit changes every 10 numbers. For example, from 1-9, the tens digit is 0, then 10-19 it's 1, 20-29 it's 2, and so on. So, in each block of 100 numbers, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for the digit 4, in the tens place, it appears 10 times every 100 numbers (like 40-49). Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times every 100 numbers (like 80-89). \n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each of the 4 complete hundreds, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49 in each hundred), so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. \n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see: from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place from 440-449, which is 10 times. So, that's 10 more times for 4 in the tens place. \n\nFor the digit 8, in the tens place, it appears from 480-488, which is 9 times because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, actually, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, there's a block of 10 numbers. So, 401-410: tens digit 0, 411-420: tens digit 1, ..., 480-488: tens digit 8. So, the digit 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. The digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so 9 times. So, yes, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages. So, total for tens place: 4 appears 40 + 10 = 50 times, 8 appears 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\nFor digit 4: it appears in 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nFor digit 8: the hundreds digit would be 8 if we had pages 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in all three places.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nNow, for the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFirst, units place: 488 pages. Each 10 pages, 1 occurrence of 4 and 8. 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48 each, plus the last 8 pages (481-488), which includes 484 (units digit 4) and 488 (units digit 8). So, units place: 48 +1 =49 for both, correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place. 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40 each. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles 0-8. For 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. For 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, 40+10=50 for 4, 40+9=49 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89= 188\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nYes, that seems right. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes 1 '4' and 1 '8'.\n   - 48 full blocks (480 pages) contribute 48 each.\n   - Pages 481-488 add 1 '4' (484) and 1 '8' (488).\n   - Total: 49 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the tens place.\n   - 4 full hundreds (400 pages) contribute 40 each.\n   - Pages 401-488: '4' appears 10 times (440-449), '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - '4' appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - '8' appears 0 times.\n   - Total: 89 '4's and 0 '8's.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, I need to find how many such sets there are in 488 pages. \n\nBut wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times (once in each full set) plus one more time in the extra pages, specifically at 484. Wait, no, 484 is within the 480-488 range, which is part of the 48th set. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. \n\nActually, the number of times 4 appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and taking the integer part, then adding 1 if the units digit of the total number is 8 or higher. Wait, no, maybe a better approach is to consider how many full decades there are and then the remaining pages. \n\nSo, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of times 4 is the units digit. Each full decade (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many full decades are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490). Wait, but 488 is less than 490, so the last decade isn't complete. So, in each of the 48 full decades, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining pages from 481 to 488, we check if there's a 4 in the units place. The numbers are 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, 488 is the last page, so the last full decade would be 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the last decade isn't complete. So, in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many 4's? Let me think differently. The number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of times 4 appears as the last digit. So, for each ten numbers, it's once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus in the last 8 numbers (481-488), does 484 have a 4? Yes, so that's one more, making it 49. So, 49 4's in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The digit 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Now, how many such ranges are there in 488 pages?\n\nLet's see, starting from 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nBut wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. Now, how many such ranges are there? Let's count:\n\n1. 40-49: yes, within 1-488\n2. 140-149: yes\n3. 240-249: yes\n4. 340-349: yes\n5. 440-449: yes\n\nSo that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let's check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 ranges, 10 each, so 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but wait, let me confirm. The first range is 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. Similarly, each subsequent range adds another 10. So, 5 ranges, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The digit 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in terms of the hundreds digit, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many 4's in the hundreds place? It's 89, but wait, no, because each number only contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, from 400-488, each page number has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is equal to the number of numbers from 400 to 488, which is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nAgain, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), we check if there's an 8 in the units place. The numbers are 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488.\n\nSo, how many such ranges are there?\n\n1. 80-89: 10 numbers\n2. 180-189: 10 numbers\n3. 280-289: 10 numbers\n4. 380-389: 10 numbers\n5. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488)\n\nWait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers? Let's check: 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, yes, 9 numbers. So, each of the first four ranges contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the last range contributes 9 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: (4 * 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me confirm. The ranges are:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's\n- 180-189: 10 8's\n- 280-289: 10 8's\n- 380-389: 10 8's\n- 480-488: 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, so 9 8's\n\nSo, total 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, there are 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 49 is 98? Wait, no, 49 + 49 is 98. But wait, let me check the tens place again. I think I might have made a mistake there.\n\nWait, in the tens place, for each range like 80-89, there are 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, so that's 10 8's. Similarly, for 180-189, another 10, and so on. So, 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 4 * 10 = 40 8's. Then, the last range is 480-488, which has 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 8's. So, total 40 + 9 = 49. So, that's correct. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, for 4's, I had 188. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's. Units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's: units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's there. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4's. We had 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10 4's, so 5 * 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 49, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49\n\nTens place: 49\n\nHundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's: 98\n\nSo, difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems a large number. Let me see if I can find another way to calculate this.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each digit place separately and count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488 / 10) + (1 if 488 % 10 >= 4 else 0). Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Actually, the formula is:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is:\n\nfull_cycles = n // 10\n\ncount = full_cycles\n\nremainder = n % 10\n\nif remainder >= d:\n    count += 1\n\nSo, for 4's in units place:\n\nfull_cycles = 488 // 10 = 48\n\nremainder = 488 % 10 = 8\n\nSince 8 >= 4, count = 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place:\n\nfull_cycles = 488 // 10 = 48\n\nremainder = 8\n\nSince 8 >= 8, count = 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nThe formula is a bit different. The number of times digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to n is:\n\nfull_cycles = n // 100\n\ncount = full_cycles * 10\n\nremainder = n % 100\n\nif remainder >= 10 * d:\n    count += min(remainder - 10 * d + 1, 10)\nelif remainder >= d * 10:\n    count += 1\nelse:\n    count += 0\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to think of each hundred as contributing 10 times the digit in the tens place. For example, in 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (40-49). Similarly, in 101-200, another 10 times, etc.\n\nSo, for 4's in the tens place:\n\nNumber of hundreds = 488 // 100 = 4 (since 4*100=400, 5*100=500 which is beyond 488)\n\nSo, each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nThen, the remaining pages from 401-488: how many 4's in the tens place?\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 4's. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\nNumber of hundreds = 488 // 100 = 4\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nThen, the remaining pages from 401-488: the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488), each with 8 in the tens place, so 9 8's. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\nFor 4's: numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's.\n\nFor 8's: numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think of a smaller example to test my approach.\n\nSuppose we have a book with 20 pages. How many 4's and 8's are there?\n\nPage numbers: 1-20.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\nUnits place: 4,14 => 2 times\n\nTens place: 40-49, but since we only go up to 20, there are no 4's in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: none.\n\nTotal 4's: 2\n\n8's:\n\nUnits place: 8,18 => 2 times\n\nTens place: 80-89, but up to 20, so none.\n\nHundreds place: none.\n\nTotal 8's: 2\n\nDifference: 2 - 2 = 0. Hmm, that's correct because in 1-20, 4's and 8's appear the same number of times.\n\nAnother test: 50 pages.\n\n4's:\n\nUnits place: 4,14,24,34,44 => 5 times\n\nTens place: 40-49 => 10 times\n\nHundreds place: none\n\nTotal 4's: 15\n\n8's:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,28,38,48 => 5 times\n\nTens place: 40-49: no 8's in tens place. Wait, in 1-50, the tens place 8's would be in 80-89, but we only go up to 50, so no 8's in tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 5\n\nDifference: 15 - 5 = 10\n\nLet me count manually:\n\n4's: 4,14,24,34,44 (units:5) and 40-49 (tens:10) => 15\n\n8's: 8,18,28,38,48 (units:5) and none in tens place => 5\n\nDifference:10. Correct.\n\nSo, my method seems to work for smaller numbers, so I think it's correct for 488 pages.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** \n     - For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n     - Total full decades in 488 pages: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n     - Each full decade contributes 1 occurrence, so 48 \u00d7 1 = 48.\n     - In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 484 has a 4 in the units place.\n     - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:**\n     - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n     - Number of such ranges: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n     - Each range contributes 10 occurrences.\n     - Total in tens place: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:**\n     - 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.\n     - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n     - Total in hundreds place: 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:**\n     - Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n     - Total full decades: 48, contributing 48 occurrences.\n     - In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 488 has an 8 in the units place.\n     - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:**\n     - 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n     - Number of such ranges: 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 occurrences.\n     - The last range is 480-488, contributing 9 occurrences.\n     - Total in tens place: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:**\n     - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n     - Total in hundreds place: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4); from 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. \n\nNow, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and an extra 8 numbers (481-488). In each complete set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, the last partial set (481-488) also includes 484, which has a 4 in the units place. So that's one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit in the tens place cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49. So that's 10 times. Similarly, from 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10 times. This pattern continues. \n\nLet me figure out how many hundreds are there in 488. There are four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, actually, 400 is the start of the next hundred, but since 488 is less than 500, the last hundred is 401-488. \n\nSo, for each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, in 1-100: 10 times, 101-200: 10 times, 201-300: 10 times, 301-400: 10 times. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 401-410, but wait, 401-410 would have the tens digit as 0, right? Wait, no, 401-410: the tens digit is 0 for 401-410? Wait, no, let me think again. Wait, 401 is 4 0 1, 402 is 4 0 2, ..., 409 is 4 0 9, and 410 is 4 1 0. So, actually, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 from 401-409, then 1 from 410-419, and so on up to 8 in 480-488. So, the tens digit 4 doesn't appear in 401-488 because the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but 4 would require the tens digit to be 4, which would be 440-449. Wait, but 440 is beyond 488? Wait, no, 440 is less than 488, so 440-449 would be within 401-488. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, that adds another 10. So, total tens place 4's would be 4*10 + 10 = 50. Wait, but earlier I thought each hundred had 10, and then the last partial hundred also has 10. So, 4 hundreds plus 1 partial, but the partial here also includes 10 more. So, total 50.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. From 1-100: 40-49: 10 times. 101-200: 140-149: 10 times. 201-300: 240-249: 10 times. 301-400: 340-349: 10 times. 401-488: 440-449: 10 times. So, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's would be units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with units place. Similar to 4's, in every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? 488/10=48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last partial set is 481-488, which includes 488, so that's one more 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\nNext, tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 8 for 80-89: 10 numbers. Similarly, 101-200: 180-189: 10 numbers, and so on.\n\nSo, how many hundreds are there? 488 pages, so 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. Each full hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4*10=40.\n\nNow, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. Wait, 480 is 4 8 0, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, that's 9 times. But wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 40 (from full hundreds) +9=49.\n\nNow, hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, total 8's would be units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Units: 49, tens:49, so total 98 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place had 49 8's and the tens place had 49, so total 98. So, 98 8's.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. So, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each step again.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\nUnits place: For each 10 numbers, one 4. 488/10=48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the last partial set (481-488) includes 484, which is one more. So, 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. So, 40+10=50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nCounting 8's:\n\nUnits place: Each 10 numbers, one 8. 48 full sets, so 48, plus the last partial set (481-488) includes 488, so one more. Total 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8. 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40. In the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9. So, total 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: No 8's, since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's in the last partial hundred. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 starting at 480. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, 40 (from full hundreds) +9=49.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. So, 40 (from full hundreds) +10=50.\n\nSo, yes, the counts seem correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188-98=90.\n\nSo, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. Subtracting these gives 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of ten. Each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 would have a 4 in the units place. So that's one more 4. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many such sets are there? Let's see, from 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, there's a set of ten where the tens digit is 4. So, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's five sets of ten, each contributing ten 4's in the tens place. So 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is 440 to 449, which is ten numbers, so that's correct. So total tens place 4's are 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. So how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: Units (49) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, every set of ten has one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of ten, each contributing one 8, so 48. Plus, in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 has an 8. That's one more, so units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is nine numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page. So, from 480 to 488, that's nine numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So how many such sets do we have? Let's see: 80-89 is one set (10 numbers), 180-189 is another (10), 280-289 is another (10), 380-389 is another (10), and 480-488 is the fifth set but only nine numbers. So for the first four sets, each contributes ten 8's, so 4 x 10 = 40. The last set contributes nine 8's. So total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So hundreds place 8's are 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So I subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: Units 49, Tens 50, Hundreds 89, totaling 188. For 8's: Units 49, Tens 49, Hundreds 0, totaling 98. 188 - 98 is indeed 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** In every set of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears once. There are 48 complete sets of ten (1-480), contributing 48 fours. The last partial set (481-488) adds one more 4, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in ten consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49). There are five such sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing ten fours, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, there are 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, adding 89 fours.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** Similar to 4's, every set of ten contributes one 8, with 48 sets and one more in the partial set (488), totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in ten consecutive numbers (e.g., 80-89). There are four complete sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing ten eights, totaling 40. The fifth set (480-488) contributes nine eights, adding 9, for a total of 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, for the units place. In the numbers 1-9, the digit 4 appears once (which is page 4). Then, in the two-digit numbers, from 10 to 99, every block of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.) has exactly one number ending with 4, so that's 1 per ten, and there are 9 such tens (10-99). So, 9 times 1 is 9. But wait, in the first ten (10-19), page 4 is already counted in the single-digit, so maybe I should adjust that. Wait no, actually, when considering two-digit numbers, from 10 to 99, each ten has one number with a 4 in the units place, so that's 9 instances (14, 24, ..., 94). Then, in the three-digit numbers, from 100 to 488, each hundred has ten numbers ending with 4 in each ten, but since the book ends at 488, I need to be careful. Let me think. From 100 to 399, that's four hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399). Each of these hundreds has ten numbers ending with 4 in each ten, so for each hundred, 10 times 1 (units place) across ten tens, so 10 per hundred. So, 4 hundreds would have 40 instances. But wait, actually, from 100 to 399, that's 3 hundreds, not 4. Wait, 100-199 is one hundred, 200-299 another, 300-399 another, so 3 hundreds. Each hundred has 10 numbers ending with 4 in the units place, so 3 times 10 is 30. Then, from 400-488, how many numbers end with 4? Let's see, 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included. So, 9 instances in the units place for 400-488. So, total units place 4's would be single-digit (1) + two-digit (9) + three-digit (30 + 9) = 1 + 9 + 39 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 1 (single-digit) + 9 (two-digit) + 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 1 + 9 + 30 + 9 = 49. That seems right.\n\nNow, for the tens place. In single-digit numbers, there's no tens place, so 0. In two-digit numbers, from 10-99, the tens place can be 4, which would cover 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 instances of 4 in the tens place. Then, in three-digit numbers, from 100-488, the tens digit can be 4 in each hundred. So, for 100-199, the tens digit 4 occurs in 140-149, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 200-299, it's 240-249, another 10. In 300-399, it's 340-349, another 10. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, but wait, 488 is the limit, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's: 10 (from 40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449) = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's valid. So, 50 instances.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place. In single-digit and two-digit numbers, the hundreds place is 0, so no 4's there. In three-digit numbers, from 100-488, the hundreds digit is 4 only in 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89), but each of these has 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 instances. So, total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 1 (single-digit) + 9 (two-digit) + 30 (100-399) + 9 (400-488) = 49. Tens place: 10 (40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449) = 50. Hundreds place: 89 (400-488). So, 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, okay, I'll go with that for now.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with units place. Single-digit numbers: 8 appears once (page 8). Two-digit numbers: from 10-99, each ten has one number ending with 8, so 9 instances (18, 28, ..., 98). Three-digit numbers: from 100-488, each hundred has ten numbers ending with 8 in each ten. So, from 100-399, that's 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 instances, so 3*10=30. Then, from 400-488, how many numbers end with 8? 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers. So, units place 8's: 1 + 9 + 30 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, tens place. Single-digit: 0. Two-digit numbers: from 10-99, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers. Three-digit numbers: from 100-488, the tens digit is 8 in each hundred. So, 100-199: 180-189, 10 numbers. 200-299: 280-289, 10. 300-399: 380-389, 10. 400-488: 480-488, but wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, tens place 8's: 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480, 481, ..., 488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 instances in the tens place for 400-488.\n\nNow, hundreds place. Single-digit and two-digit: 0. Three-digit numbers: from 100-488, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check again. Units place: 1 (single-digit) + 9 (two-digit) + 30 (100-399) + 9 (400-488) = 49. Tens place: 10 (80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 49. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 1 (4) + 9 (14,24,...,94) + 30 (100-399: 10 each hundred) + 9 (400-488: 404,414,...,484) = 49.\n- Tens: 10 (40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449) = 50.\n- Hundreds: 89 (400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 1 (8) + 9 (18,28,...,98) + 30 (100-399: 10 each hundred) + 9 (408,418,...,488) = 49.\n- Tens: 10 (80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 1 (from 4) + 9 (from 14, 24, ..., 94) + 30 (from 104, 204, ..., 394) + 9 (from 404, 414, ..., 484) = 49\n- **Tens place:** 10 (from 40-49) + 10 (from 140-149) + 10 (from 240-249) + 10 (from 340-349) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 (from 400-488)\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 1 (from 8) + 9 (from 18, 28, ..., 98) + 30 (from 108, 208, ..., 398) + 9 (from 408, 418, ..., 488) = 49\n- **Tens place:** 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (from 180-189) + 10 (from 280-289) + 10 (from 380-389) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49\n- **Hundreds place:** 0\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
