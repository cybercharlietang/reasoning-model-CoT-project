Wait, let me think again: from 1 to 488, how many 4's and 8's are there. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as each digit position separately. Let me try another approach for cross-verification. For the units digit: For 4's, in each block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 full blocks of 10 in 480, and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, 48*1=48, plus one more 4 in 484, so total 49. Correct. Similarly, for 8's, same logic: 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then in 481-488, 8 appears in 488, so that's one more, total 49. Correct. For the tens digit: 4's: Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. There are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 400-409, 410-419,... up to 440-449. Wait, no, actually, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 each 10 numbers. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 400-409:10, 410-419:10,... up to 440-449:10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. So, total 40 (from 0-399) +50=90? Wait, that contradicts my earlier count. Wait, no, earlier I had 5 sets of 10 for 4's in the tens place, which was 50. But now, this approach is considering 4 full hundreds (0-399) giving 4*10=40, and then 400-488 giving another 50? That can't be right because 400-488 is part of the 400-488 range, which is 89 numbers. Wait, maybe I'm confusing something. Let me clarify: For the tens digit, in each hundred, like 0-99, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in 0-99, the tens digit is 4 exactly 10 times (40-49). Similarly, in 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. So, up to 399, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419,...,440-449. So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. So, total 40+50=90. But wait, earlier I had 50 fours in the tens place. So, which is correct? Wait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because in the 400-488 range, the tens digit being 4 occurs in 400-409, 410-419,...,440-449. That's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. But from 0-399, it's 4 sets of 10, which is 40. So, total 90 fours in the tens place. But that contradicts my earlier count where I thought it was 50. Wait, I think I confused the hundreds place with the tens place. Wait, no, earlier when I counted the tens place, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. So, perhaps I'm overcounting now. Wait, maybe I should consider that in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419,...,440-449, which is 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours in the tens place. But then, from 0-399, it's 4 sets of 10, so 40. So, total 90 fours in the tens place. But that would mean that the total number of fours is units (49) + tens (90) + hundreds (89) = 49+90=139+89=228. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I had 188. So, I must have made a mistake in one of the approaches. Let me figure this out. I think the confusion comes from whether the 400-488 range is part of the tens digit counting or the hundreds digit. Let me separate the hundreds digit counting. For the hundreds digit: 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. For the tens digit: In each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, in 0-99, tens digit 4 occurs 10 times. Similarly, in 100-199, 10 times, and so on up to 300-399, 10 times. So, that's 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419,...,440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. So, total tens digit fours:40+50=90. Units digit fours:49. So, total fours:89+90+49=228. But wait, that's way higher than my initial count of 188. So, I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me check the initial count again. Earlier, I thought that in the tens place, the fours were in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, so 50. But according to this other approach, it's 90. So, which is correct? Wait, I think the confusion is that in the initial approach, I didn't consider that in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, etc., which adds another 50 fours. So, the initial approach was wrong because I only considered up to 440-449, but actually, 400-488 includes more. Wait, no, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, in the initial approach, I had 5 sets of 10 in the tens place, which is 50. But according to the other approach, it's 90. So, which is correct? I think the initial approach was wrong because it didn't account for all the tens digit fours. Let me try to list some numbers to see. For example, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419,...,440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours in the tens place just in 400-488. Plus, in 0-399, we have 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349, which is 4 sets of 10, so 40 fours. So, total tens digit fours:40+50=90. So, that's correct. Therefore, the initial approach was wrong because I didn't consider that in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 5 sets, adding 50 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (90) + hundreds (89) = 49+90=139+89=228. But wait, that seems too high because when I first counted, I had 188. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me check the problem again. Wait, the problem is to count how many more 4's than 8's. So, if I'm recounting and getting 228 fours and 98 eights, the difference would be 130, which seems quite high. But let's see. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcounting the fours in the tens place. Let me think differently. Let's count the number of fours in each digit position separately, considering the entire range from 1 to 488.\n\n**Counting Fours:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The units digit cycles every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, how many complete cycles of 10 are there? 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 complete cycles.\n   - In each cycle, 4 appears once in the units place (e.g., 4,14,24,...).\n   - So, 48 fours from complete cycles.\n   - Now, check the partial cycle from 481 to 488: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488.\n   - Here, 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's 1 more.\n   - Total units place fours:48+1=49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers.\n   - In each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each.\n   - So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49,140-149,...).\n   - From 1 to 400, there are 4 hundreds (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place: 4*10=40.\n   - Now, from 400 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409,410-419,...,440-449.\n   - That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours.\n   - Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct.\n   - So, total tens place fours:40+50=90.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 =89.\n   - So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up:49 (units) +90 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=228 fours.\n\n**Counting Eights:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, 488 /10=48.8, so 48 complete cycles.\n   - Each cycle contributes one 8 in the units place:48.\n   - Check the partial cycle 481-488:488 has an 8 in the units place, so 1 more.\n   - Total units place eights:48+1=49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488.\n   - Each of the first four ranges (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) has 10 numbers.\n   - The last range,480-488, has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive).\n   - So, total tens place eights:10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so no eights here.\n\nTotal eights:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\n**Difference:**\n228 fours -98 eights=130.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 90, but now I'm getting 130. I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the initial approach, I thought the tens digit fours were 50, but now I'm seeing it's 90. So, the initial approach was wrong, and the correct count is 228 fours and 98 eights, difference 130.\n\nBut let me think again: is the count of fours in the tens place really 90? Because from 0-399, it's 4 sets of 10, which is 40, and from 400-488, it's 5 sets of 10, which is 50, totaling 90. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, units place fours:49, hundreds place:89.\n\nSo, 49+90+89=228.\n\nEights: units 49, tens 49, so 98.\n\nDifference:228-98=130.\n\nBut wait, I think I might have overcounted the tens place fours in 400-488. Let me check: in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409,410-419,...,440-449. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 50 fours in the tens place from 400-488, plus 40 from 0-399, total 90. Correct.\n\nSo, the correct difference is 130 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 90, but now it's 130. Let me check the problem again to make sure I'm interpreting it correctly. The problem says \"how many more 4's are printed than 8's.\" So, if fours are 228 and eights are 98, the difference is 130.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcounting the fours in the hundreds place. Let me check: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a formula to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position.\n\nThe formula for counting the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is:\n\nnumber_of_times = (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\nnumber_of_times = (n // 100) * 10 + max(0, min(10, n % 100 - d*10 +1))\n\nWait, perhaps using a more systematic approach would help.\n\nLet me try to count the number of fours and eights using digit positions and mathematical formulas.\n\n**Counting the number of times a digit d appears in each position up to number n:**\n\nFor a given digit position (units, tens, hundreds), we can calculate how many times digit d appears.\n\nLet's define the number as ABC, where A is hundreds, B is tens, C is units.\n\nBut since our number is 488, which is a three-digit number, we can consider each digit position separately.\n\n**Counting Fours:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - We can use the formula: count = (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >=4 else 0)\n   - n=488, so n//10=48, n%10=8 >=4, so count=48+1=49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Formula: count = (n // 100) *10 + max(0, (n % 100) - 4*10 +1)\n   - n=488, n//100=4, so 4*10=40.\n   - n%100=88, so 88 -40 +1=49. But since 49>10, we take min(49,10)=10. Wait, no, the formula is a bit different. Let me recall the correct formula.\n\nThe correct formula for the tens place is:\n\ncount = (higher digits) * 10 + (if current digit > d, add 10; if current digit ==d, add (units +1))\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use a more precise method.\n\nFor the tens place digit d:\n\n- Split the number into higher part (above the tens digit), current digit, and lower part (units digit).\n\nFor example, in 488:\n\n- Higher part = 4 (since we're looking at the tens place, the higher part is the hundreds digit).\n- Current digit =8 (tens place).\n- Lower part=8 (units place).\n\nThe formula for the number of times d appears in the tens place is:\n\ncount = higher *10 + (if current > d, 10; else if current ==d, lower +1; else 0)\n\nSo, for d=4 in the tens place:\n\nhigher=4, current=8, lower=8.\n\nSince current=8 >4, count=4*10 +10=40+10=50.\n\nSo, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Formula: count = (higher part) *100 + (if current >d, 100; else if current==d, lower part +1; else 0)\n   - Wait, actually, for the hundreds place, it's simpler. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nSo, total fours:49 (units)+50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nWait, now I'm getting 188 fours again, which contradicts the earlier count of 228. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the tens place calculation earlier. Let me use the formula correctly.\n\nUsing the formula for the tens place:\n\nFor d=4 in the tens place of numbers up to 488:\n\nhigher = 4 (hundreds digit)\ncurrent =8 (tens digit)\nlower =8 (units digit)\n\nSince current=8 >4, the count is higher *10 +10=4*10+10=50.\n\nSo, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nUnits place fours:49.\n\nHundreds place fours:89.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, for eights:\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - d=8\n   - count = (488//10)=48 + (1 if 488%10 >=8 else 0)=48+1=49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - higher=4, current=8, lower=8\n   - Since current=8 >=8, count=4*10 + (lower +1)=40 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - d=8\n   - higher=0, current=4, lower=88\n   - Since current=4 <8, count=0.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, so now I'm getting 90 as the difference, which aligns with my initial count but contradicts the later approach where I thought it was 130. So, where was I going wrong earlier?\n\nI think the confusion came from misapplying the formula. The correct count using the formula gives 188 fours and 98 eights, so the difference is 90.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. We analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting Fours:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 fours.\n   - The partial set (481-488) includes 484, adding 1 more.\n   - Total: 49 fours.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - In each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).\n   - From 1-399: 4 sets of 10, totaling 40 fours.\n   - From 400-488: 5 sets (400-409, 410-419, ..., 440-449), adding 50 fours.\n   - Total: 90 fours.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89 fours.\n\n**Total Fours:**\n49 (units) + 90 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 228 fours.\n\n**Counting Eights:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Similar to fours, 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No eights since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total Eights:**\n49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98 eights.\n\n**Difference:**\n228 fours - 98 eights = 130 more fours.\n\nHowever, upon re-evaluating using a more precise formula, the correct counts are:\n\n- **Fours:** 188\n- **Eights:** 98\n\nThus, the correct difference is:\n\n188 fours - 98 eights = 90 more fours.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

So, 89. So, 49+50+89=188. That's correct. Now, the 8's: - Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1 gives 49. Correct. - Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. - Hundreds place: 0. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have missed something. Let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. And for the tens place, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 in the tens place. Units place:49. So, 188 fours. For 8's, units:49, tens:49, so 98. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I feel like maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me try another approach. Alternatively, I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each position separately. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, for the 4's:\n\n- Units place: For each 10 numbers, there's one 4 in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 /10=48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4, so 48. But wait, in the 480-489 range, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but the units digit 4 appears at 484, which is within this range. So, total units place 4's:48 (from 1-480) plus 1 (484), totaling 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: For each 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, in each 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. From 1-488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8, so from 400-488, the tens digit is 0-8. So, in 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 488 is beyond 449, so 440-449 is fully included. So, that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's:40+10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4. So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\n- Units place: Similarly, each 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. From 1-488, how many? 488/10=48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. But in the last partial group (481-488), we have 488, which is an 8. So, total units place 8's:48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: For each 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, in each 100, 10 times the tens digit is 8. From 1-488, we have:\n\n   - 1-100:80-89, so 10 times.\n   - 101-200:180-189, 10.\n   - 201-300:280-289, 10.\n   - 301-400:380-389,10.\n   - 401-488:480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's:10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for 4's, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, 50 in total.\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nSo, 188 fours.\n\nFor 8's, units:49, tens:49, so 98.\n\nDifference:90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot, but maybe that's correct.\n\nLet me try another way: count the number of 4's and 8's in each position separately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write a small table to count the occurrences.\n\nBut I think my initial approach is correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding how many more 4's are printed than 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers (from 4 to 484 inclusive).\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n   Total 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks each contribute 10 occurrences, and the last block contributes 9 (since the book ends at 488). Total tens place 8's = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8, as the book ends at 488.\n\n   Total 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

But does 488 have a 4 in the hundreds place? Yes, because 488 is 4 (hundreds), 8 (tens), 8 (units). So yes, it's included. Similarly, 440-449: each of those has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. For the 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10, because 489 is beyond 488. So that's correct. So, the total number of 8's is 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90.
