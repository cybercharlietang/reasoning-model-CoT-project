For example, in the hundreds place for 4's, I counted 400-488 as 89 numbers. 488 - 400 +1 = 89. Correct. For the tens place of 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488, which is 9 numbers. Yes, because 488 is included. So, that's correct. Units place for 8's: up to 488, which is included, so 49. So, I think my counts are correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place for every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Number of 4's = 484 / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place for every block of 100 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).  \n   - Number of blocks = 5 (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).  \n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers.  \n   - Number of 4's = 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488.  \n   - Number of numbers = 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.  \n   - Number of 4's = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the units place for every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Number of 8's = 488 / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place for every block of 100 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).  \n   - Number of blocks = 5 (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).  \n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers except the last block (480-488), which contributes 9.  \n   - Number of 8's = 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.  \n   - Number of 8's = 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

Hmm, but I thought the answer might be different. Let me think again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let's see: from 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right. And for the tens place, 50 fours, and units 49. So 188 total fours. For 8's, units and tens each have 49, so 98. So the difference is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because I thought maybe the 8's in the hundreds place would be zero, which they are, so that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should check by writing out a smaller example to see if my method works. Let's say a book with 20 pages. How many 1's and 2's? Let's count 1's: units place:1,11: 2 times. Tens place:10-19:10 times. So total 12 ones. 2's: units:2,12:2 times. Tens:20:1 time. So total 3 twos. Difference is 12-3=9. Let me count manually: pages 1-20. The number of 1's: 1,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19. That's 11 ones. Wait, but according to my method, I would have units:2 (1 and 11), tens:10 (10-19), so 12. But actually, it's 11. Hmm, so my method overcounts by 1 in this case. Because when you count 10-19, that's 10 numbers, each with a 1 in the tens place, but the units place for 10 is 0, so no extra 1's there. Wait, but in my example, the 1's in the units place are 1,11. So, 2 times. Tens place:10-19:10 times. So total 12. But when I list them, I get 1,10,11,12,...,19. That's 11 numbers with 1's. Wait, why the discrepancy? Because in page 11, there are two 1's, but I'm only counting each occurrence once. Wait, no, in the problem, each page number is printed once, and we're counting the number of digits. So in page 11, there are two 1's, so that's two 1's. So in the example, the number of 1's would be: units place:1,11: 2. Tens place:10-19:10. So total 12. But when I list the pages, each page number is printed once, so page 11 has two 1's. So, the total number of 1's is indeed 12. So, my method is correct. So, going back to the original problem, my count of 188 fours and 98 eights should be correct. Therefore, the difference is 90.

    "text": " Correct. - Tens place: Each hundred block has 10, and there are 5 blocks (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, but in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 400-409, 410-419,...,480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but wait, no, in the tens place, it's 480-489, but since we stop at 488, the tens digit 8 in 480-488 is still 9 numbers? Wait, no, when considering the tens digit as 8, the numbers are 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. So, in the tens place, each hundred block has 10, except the last one which has 9. So, that's 4 full hundreds (0-399) each contributing 10, and the last hundred (400-488) contributing 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. That seems correct. For the 4's in the tens place, it's similar: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, and 440-449 is within 488, so 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. Correct. For the hundreds place, 4's are from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188 fours. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, so 98 eights. 188 -98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly? For the tens place of fours, I included 440-449, which is correct because 449 is less than 488. And for the tens place of eights, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page.

For the 8's: - Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th term, so 49 eights. - Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 =89. So, that's correct. And for the tens place, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. For the 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, yes, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\frac{484}{10} + 1 = 49 \\) times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\) times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\) times.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n\\[ 49 \\ (\\text{units}) + 50 \\ (\\text{tens}) + 89 \\ (\\text{hundreds}) = 188 \\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\frac{488}{10} + 1 = 49 \\) times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The last block (480-488) contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\) times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0 times.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n\\[ 49 \\ (\\text{units}) + 49 \\ (\\text{tens}) + 0 \\ (\\text{hundreds}) = 98 \\]\n\n**Calculating the difference:**\n\\[ 188 \\ (\\text{number of 4's}) - 98 \\ (\\text{number of 8's}) = 90 \\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"
