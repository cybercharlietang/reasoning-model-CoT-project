    "text": " Maybe I should think of it as for each hundred, there are 10 fours in the units place, so 4 hundreds (1-400), but wait, 488 is less than 500. So, up to 488, so in units place, 4 appears 4 times in 1-100, 4 times in 101-200, 4 times in 201-300, 4 times in 301-400, and then in 401-488, how many? From 401 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in units place? 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers. So, 4 times 4 (for 1-400) is 16, plus 9 in 401-488, which is 25. Wait, that contradicts my earlier count of 49. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me try a different approach. For units place, the number of 4's is the number of times 4 appears in the ones digit. Each 10 numbers have exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many tens are there? 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. But then, in the 48th ten, which is 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so the 48th ten would be 480-489, but we only have 480-488. So, in that last partial ten, does 484 count as a 4 in the units place? Yes, so that's one more. So, total units place 4's: 48 +1=49. That matches my initial count. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. From 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10, making it 50. So, 50 fours in tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now for eights: Units place:8,18,...,488. Each ten has one 8, so 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and then 488 itself is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each hundred contributes 10, so 4 hundreds would be 40, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so 40 +9=49. Hundreds place: none, as before.

Wait, maybe a better way is to calculate how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor((488)/10) +1 if the units digit is >=4? Wait, maybe a better formula is:\n\nFor a given digit d and position p (units=1, tens=10, hundreds=100), the count can be calculated as:\n\ncount = (N / (p*10)) * p + min(max(N % (p*10) - (d*p) +1, 0), p)\n\nWait, that's a bit complicated, but let me try.\n\nAlternatively, for units place (p=1):\n\nNumber of 4's in units place: floor(488/10)*1 + min(488%10 >=4 ? 1 :0, 1). So, floor(488/10)=48, and 488%10=8, which is >=4, so +1. So, 48+1=49. That matches.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place (p=10):\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/(10*10))=floor(488/100)=4. So, 4*10=40. Then, the remainder is 488 - 4*100=88. The next part is min(88 -4*10 +1, 10). 88-40=48, so min(48+1,10)=9. Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, for tens place, each 100 numbers have 10 numbers with tens digit 4, so 4*10=40. Then, the last partial hundred: from 400 to 488, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, total 40 +10=50. So, 50 fours in tens place. Similarly, for hundreds place, 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: same as before, 49.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: none, as 800 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nThus, 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours.\n\nIn the tens place for 4's, each hundred block has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, so 4 blocks (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349) contribute 4*10=40. Then, in 440-449, that's another 10, so 50 in total.\n\nUnits place: 4,14,...,484: 49 numbers.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188 fours.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9.

So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units. Tens place:80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in tens. So, 49+49=98 eights total. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.

    "text": " Maybe I should think of it as 488 pages, so units place 4's: how many times does 4 appear in the units place? For each 10 numbers, it's once. So, 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full tens, but wait, 488 is the last page, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in units? Let's see, 4,14,...,484. The last one is 484, which is the 49th occurrence because 484 is 4*121, so 121st multiple, but that's not the right way. Alternatively, the number of times is floor((488 +1)/10) when considering 0-based, but maybe it's better to think of it as (488 -4)/10 +1 = (484)/10 +1=48.4 +1=49.4, so 49 times. So, units place:49 fours. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now for the eights: units place:8,18,...,488. So, 488/10=48.8, so 49 times. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, units and tens each have 49 eights, totaling 98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90.

Wait, no, because 484 is the last page with 4 in units. So, 484 is 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 is correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10.

So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again: when counting the tens place for 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct.

Wait, no, because 488/10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but since 484 is the last one, which is 48*10 +4=484, so yes, 49 times. So units:49. Tens:40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10.

But wait, let me check the hundreds place for 8's again. Since the book only goes up to 488, there's no page 800-899, so no 8's in the hundreds place. So, yes, 0. So, the difference is 90. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct.
