The formula is (last - first)/step +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. That's correct. For 8's in units place, same way: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.

That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So 5*10=50. Correct. For tens place of 8's: 80-89,180-189,...,480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct. Hundreds place for 4's: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4. Correct. So, 188 fours and 98 eights.

For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place for fours. When I counted the tens place for fours, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. That's correct. For the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. Now, for the eights: in the tens place, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. So, 49 in the tens place. Units place:49, tens:49, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again: when counting the units place for fours, I considered 4,14,...,484. How many terms is that? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in the units place. Correct. Similarly, for eights in the units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. So, yes, 49 each in units place. Tens place: fours have 50, eights have 49. So, 50-49=1 more four in the tens place. Hundreds place: fours have 89, eights have 0. So, 89 more fours in the hundreds place. So, total difference: 1 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =90.

Total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that's a lot. Let me see if I missed something. Wait, maybe I overcounted the hundreds place for fours? Let me check: 400-488 inclusive. 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. Correct. For eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 480,481,...,488, which is 9 numbers. Correct. So, I think the counts are accurate. Therefore, the difference is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems a big difference, but given the higher number of page numbers in the hundreds place, maybe it's correct. Let me think: from 1-99, how many 4's and 8's? Let's do a quick check. From 1-99: Units place: 4 appears 9 times (4,14,...,84). Wait, no, 4,14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94: that's 10 times, right? Wait, earlier I thought units place from 1-488 has 49 fours, but maybe that's not the right way. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial counting. Let me try a different approach. Let's count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately, but perhaps more carefully. For units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: For each 10 numbers, there's one 4. From 1-488, how many complete decades are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then in the 49th decade (481-490), but since we only go up to 488, that's 8 numbers beyond 480. So, in the units place, 48*1 + 1 (for 484) = 49 fours. Wait, but 484 is within 481-488, so that's correct. So, units place:49 fours.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: same logic, 49 eights.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's: Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. So, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. Up to 440-449. How many hundreds? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit in 400-488 can be 0-8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419,... up to 440-449. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449. That's 5 sets of 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place from 400-488. Plus, in earlier hundreds (0-99, 100-199, etc.), each has 10 numbers with tens digit 4. So, 0-99:40-49 (10), 100-199:140-149 (10), 200-299:240-249 (10), 300-399:340-349 (10), and 400-488:50 as above. So, total tens place fours: 5 sets *10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, etc. From 0-99:80-89 (10), 100-199:180-189 (10), 200-299:280-289 (10), 300-399:380-389 (10), and 400-488:480-488 (9). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor fours: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nFor eights: 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\nFours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99 +89=188.\n\nEights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe I overcounted, but after checking, it seems correct.
