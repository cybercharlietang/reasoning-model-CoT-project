    "text": " Maybe I overcounted the fours in the hundreds place. Let me recount the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right because 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 fours there. Tens place for fours: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? Let's see, from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers. So, 488 /10 =48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188.

Let me think again about the tens place for eights. 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's correct, 9 numbers. So, 5 sets: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). 10+10+10+10+9=49. Units place:8,18,...,488. The last number is 488, which is 8*61=488. So, from 8*1=8 to 8*61=488, that's 61 numbers? Wait, no, because 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 units place eights. So, units:49, tens:49, total 98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90.

For 8's, in the tens place, I had 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So that's correct. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49 in the tens place. Units place:49, so total 98. 4's:188, so difference is 90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me try another approach. Maybe using a formula or a different counting method. Alternatively, think about each digit place separately for 4 and 8, and see if the counts are accurate. For 4's: Units place: From 1-488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49.

Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, and the last set has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, since 800>488.

That's right.\n\nFor eights:\n- Units: from 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=49. Correct.\n- Tens: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n- Hundreds: 0. So, 49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I feel like maybe I'm missing something. Let me try another approach. Maybe using a different method to count the digits.\n\nAnother way is to consider each digit position separately and calculate how many times each digit appears.\n\nFor the units place:\n- For 4: occurs once every 10 numbers, so total occurrences = floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49. Correct.\n- For 8: same as 4, so 49. Correct.\n\nFor the tens place:\n- For 4: each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4, so 4 hundreds (0-3) and then 440-449, which is another 10. Wait, no, the hundreds go up to 4, so 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, in each hundred except the last, there's 10 numbers with tens digit 4. So, 4 hundreds (0-3) each contribute 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total for tens place: 40+10=50. Correct.\n\nFor 8 in tens place:\n- Similarly, each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 8, so 0-3 hundreds: 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total:40+9=49. Correct.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n- For 4: occurs in 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n- For 8: none, since the book ends at 488. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up again: fours=49+50+89=188, eights=49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the tens place for 8, I only got 49, which is correct because the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, yes, 49 is correct.\n\nI think my earlier counts are correct, so the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

Hmm, another way to think about it: in the hundreds place, fours have a big advantage because from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Whereas, eights don't have any numbers in the hundreds place. So that's 89 fours right there, which is a significant lead. Then, in the tens and units places, fours and eights are similar, but fours have a slight edge. Wait, in the tens place, fours have 50 and eights have 49. Similarly, in the units place, both have 49.

So that's correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188.

So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9=49. So, total 49. Correct. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that's a lot. Let me think if there's another way to approach this, maybe using digit positions more carefully. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position. Let me try that. For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), I can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear. Let's start with the units place: For units digit, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n can be calculated as follows. For units digit, it's floor(n/10) *1 + something if the remainder is >=d. But maybe it's easier to think in terms of cycles. Each 10 numbers, each digit from 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, for the units digit, the number of times 4 appears is the number of complete decades (each 10 numbers) times 1, plus 1 if the last partial decade includes 4. Similarly for 8. Let's compute for 4 in units place: The total number of page numbers is 488. The number of complete decades is 488//10=48. Each complete decade has one 4 in the units place, so 48. Now, the remaining numbers after 480 are 481-488. Do these include a 4 in the units place? 484 is in this range, so that's one more. So total 48+1=49 fours in the units place. Same as before. For 8 in units place: 488//10=48 complete decades, each contributing one 8, so 48. The remaining numbers are 481-488. The units digits here are 1-8, so 488 is included, which is an 8. So, that's one more. So, 48+1=49 eights in the units place. Correct. Now, for the tens place: Each 100 numbers have 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, in 0-99, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly for 8 in 80-89. So, for the tens digit, the number of times 4 appears is the number of complete hundreds times 10, plus the number of tens digits in the incomplete hundred. Let's compute for 4 in the tens place: The total number of page numbers is 488. The number of complete hundreds is 4 (since 4*100=400). Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, the remaining pages are 401-488. In the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Looking at 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-409) to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's 10 numbers. So, total fours in tens place: 40 +10=50. Correct. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place: Number of complete hundreds is 4, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. The remaining pages are 401-488. The tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, total eights in tens place: 40 +9=49. Correct. Now, for the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488. That's 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. For 8 in hundreds place: Since the book ends at 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights here. Adding up, fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 188. Eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems consistent. But wait, I'm wondering if I'm counting correctly in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct because 488 - 400 +1 =89. So, 89 fours. Okay, so I think my count is correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed in the page numbers is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

    "text": " Maybe I overcounted the hundreds place for 4's. Let me recount the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. For the units place of 4's, from 4,14,...,484: that's 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. So 49+50+89=188. For 8's, units:49, tens:49, so 98. So 188-98=90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should check another way. Let me think: in each position, how many 4's and 8's are there. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the number of times each digit appears in each position. Let me try that approach again. For units place: For 4's, every 10 numbers, so total pages are 488. So, the number of 4's in units place is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 is included, we have 49. Similarly, for 8's, same logic: 488/10=48.8, so 49. So, units place: 49 fours, 49 eights. Tens place: For 4's, each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in tens place, so total hundreds are 4 (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each hundred. So, in each full hundred (like 0-99), there are 10 numbers with 4 in tens place. So, from 0-399, that's 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40 fours in tens place. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10. So total tens place fours: 40 +10=50. Similarly, for 8's in tens place: each hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in tens place, so 0-399: 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, 40 +9=49 eights in tens place. So, that's correct. Hundreds place: For 4's, from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. For 8's, hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so 0 eights here. So, total fours: units 49 + tens 50 + hundreds 89 = 188. Eights: units 49 + tens 49 + hundreds 0 = 98. So, 188 -98=90. I think that's correct.

    "text": " Maybe I overcounted the hundreds place for 4's. The hundreds digit for 4's is from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, right? So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Units place for 4's: from 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units place:49, tens place:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that's a lot. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. Let's try another approach to verify. For each digit position, count the number of 4's and 8's separately. 1. Units place: For 4's, numbers ending with 4 from 1 to 488. The first is 4, last is 484. The count is floor(484/10) +1 =48+1=49. For 8's, numbers ending with 8 from 1 to 488. First is 8, last is 488. So, same calculation: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, both 4's and 8's have 49 in units place. 2. Tens place: For 4's, the tens digit is 4. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. From 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, there are 5 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only part of a block. So, in 400-488, the tens digit can be 4 (440-449). So, how many full blocks? 0-99: 40-49:10\n100-199:140-149:10\n200-299:240-249:10\n300-399:340-349:10\n400-488:440-449:10 (since 440-449 is within 400-488)\nWait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. For 8's in the tens place: numbers like 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-489, but the book ends at 488. So, how many blocks? 0-99:80-89:10\n100-199:180-189:10\n200-299:280-289:10\n300-399:380-389:10\n400-488:480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page)\nSo, 4 full blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. Hundreds place: For 4's, numbers from 400-488. That's 488-400+1=89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. For 8's, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, 0 eights here. So, adding up: 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's. I don't see where I might have gone wrong, but let me just check one more time. Maybe I should list out some numbers to see if the counts make sense. For example, in the units place, 4 and 8 each appear 49 times. That seems correct because every 10 numbers, they each appear once. In the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, while 8 appears 49 times because the last block for 8's is only 9 numbers. And in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, while 8 doesn't appear at all. So, the difference is indeed 188-98=90.

    "text": " For fours, units place: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, but since we include 484, it's 49 numbers. Tens place: each hundred block has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). That's 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For eights, units: same as fours, 49. Tens: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks have 10 each, and the last has 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 doesn't appear as the hundreds digit in any page number up to 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
