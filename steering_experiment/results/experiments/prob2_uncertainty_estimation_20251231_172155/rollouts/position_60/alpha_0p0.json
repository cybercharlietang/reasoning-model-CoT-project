    "text": " Let me recount the fours. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, the eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Number of terms: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly? For the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the tens place, in the hundreds, like 440-449, that's 10 numbers, correct. And the units place, 49 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For the eights, units:49, tens:49, so 98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the tens place for eights again. When I have 480-488, that's 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers. So, 480-488: 9, not 10. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, yes, 98 eights. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check if I missed any numbers. For example, in the hundreds place for eights, since the book is only up to 488, there are no 800-899 pages, so no eights in the hundreds place. Correct. So, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Hmm, but wait, when counting the tens place for eights, I had 5 sets, but the last set was only 9 numbers. Let me double-check that. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9.

Hmm, but wait, in the tens place for eights, I counted 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, yes, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds. So, 98 eights. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right because 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours there. So, the total fours are 49+50+89=188. Eights are 49+49=98. So, the difference is 90. Hmm, but I feel like maybe I missed something. Let me try another approach. Alternatively, I could write a small program or use a formula to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position. But since I'm doing this manually, let me try to recount. For fours: units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48, but wait, the last number is 488, which is 8 in the units place, so the last 4 in the units place is 484. So, from 4,14,...,484, that's (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Similarly, tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 4 in tens place. How many such blocks? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. So, 50 fours in tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each with 4 in hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. For eights: units place. 8,18,...,488. So, 488-8=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place.
