    "text": " From 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 divided by 10 plus 1, which is (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count each set: - 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. - 140-149: another 10. - 240-249: another 10. - 340-349: another 10. - 440-449: another 10. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid because 449 is less than 488. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 5*10=50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, there are 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups of 10, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit):** '4' appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit):** '4' appears in numbers 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** '8' appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The last set is 480-488, giving 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers in the 800s, so 0 occurrences.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the number of '8's from '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " If I take 484 - 4 = 480, then 480 / 10 = 48, so there are 49 numbers where the units digit is 4. Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me think again. The number of times a digit appears in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated as floor(N/10) + 1 if the units digit is less than or equal to N's units digit. But in this case, N is 488, and we're looking for 4 in the units place. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete decades (each set of 10 numbers) plus 1 if the units digit is 4 in the incomplete decade. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But then, in the incomplete decade, which is 480-488, the units digits go from 0 to 8. So, the 4 in the units place occurs once here as well (484). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, and so on up to 440-449. How many such ranges are there? The hundreds digit can be 0 (for 40-49), 1, 2, 3, or 4. So that's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the range 440-449 is entirely within 488, so all 10 numbers are included. Therefore, the tens place 4's are 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's printed. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's count how many times this happens. The first occurrence is at 8, the last is at 488. So, how many such numbers? The number of complete decades is 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, in the incomplete decade 480-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. So, that's one more 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last part. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers except possibly the last one if it's cut short. Let's check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers, all within 488. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8, and the units digits go from 0 to 8. So, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, for the tens place, the first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's printed. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484)\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488)\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting the 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488)\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe it's better to think of it as how many times 4 appears in the units place up to 488. So, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor(488 / 10) = 48 times. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but the 49th occurrence would be at 490, which is beyond 488. So, yes, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. The first range is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, all 5 ranges are valid. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place, which would be from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 here, so every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 times. Okay, so the digit 4 appears 187 times. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers in the units place: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's count how many times that is. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so does that count as the 49th occurrence? Wait, 8,18,...,488. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers. The last one is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, how many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that's different from the 4's. Because for 4's, 484 was the last in the units place, which is 48 times. But for 8's, 488 is included, so it's 49 times. Let me confirm: the first term is 8, the last term is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers, except the last one, which contributes 9 numbers (from 480 to 488). So, let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers. So total is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Maybe I should calculate it differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. The last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is 48 times. So, yes, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in each hundred, there's a block where the tens digit is 4, contributing 10 numbers. So, 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, each number has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's count how many times. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 numbers. Let's see how many such blocks are there. From 0-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 4\u00d710=40 times. But wait, 488 is beyond 389, so 488's tens digit is 8, but it's part of the 480-489 range, but 480-489 isn't a full block because the book ends at 488. So, in the tens place, 8 appears in 480-488 as well. From 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but how many numbers? 488 - 480 +1 = 9 numbers. Wait, but earlier I counted up to 389, so I need to include 480-488 as another block. So, actually, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So that's 5 blocks. The first four are full blocks (10 each), and the last one is 9 numbers (480-488). So, total in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 +9=49 times. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, yes, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 +49=97 times. Now, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. So, the difference is 187 -97=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

    "text": " If I count starting from 4, each step increases by 10. So, the number of 4's in the units place is actually (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, 484 is within 488, so yes, it's valid. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many sets of 100 there are. From 1-488, we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. In each hundred, the tens place is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, for each complete hundred, that's 10 occurrences. There are 4 complete hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens place is 4 for 40-49, but in this case, it's 40-49 within 401-488? Wait, no. Wait, 401-488 is the 400s, so the tens place is 4 for 401-409, 410-419, etc. Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: The tens digit is 4 in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, each of these ranges is 10 numbers. Now, since the book goes up to 488, 440-449 is within the range, but 450-459 would be next, but that's beyond 488 only up to 488. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's fine. So, how many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, the tens digit 4 appears 50 times. Wait, but earlier I thought 4 complete hundreds, but actually, it's 5 sets because 440-449 is the fifth set. So, 5 * 10 = 50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 only for numbers 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, the number of 8's in the units place is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count these. Each complete hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except possibly the last one. So, from 0-488, how many sets of 100 have 80-89? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10. That's 4 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the incomplete hundred, 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more. So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 to the count of 8's. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units Place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens Place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units Place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens Place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. There are 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** 8 does not appear. There are 0 occurrences.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's one set, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's a total of 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449? Since the book ends at 488, 449 is within the range. So yes, 5 sets. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This would be from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 4's. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first is 8, the last is 488. How many terms? Let's compute ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see: 80-89 is one set, 180-189 is another, 280-289, and 380-389. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4 * 10 = 40 8's in the tens place. Wait, does 480-489 count? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place. But wait, 480-489 would be the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place? No, wait, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, does that mean the tens place 8's include 480-488? Let me think: when counting the tens place, we're looking for numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So that's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers instead of 10. So, how many 8's in the tens place? 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) give 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 more 8's in the tens place. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 8's. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. Let me re-examine that. When counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last set, 480-488, is 9 numbers. So total 40+9=49. That's correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, total 98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10 terms, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488.

So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 ranges. Each has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, the last range is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is one range. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So, the range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, that's not a full 10 numbers. So, let's see: for the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So total tens place 8's: 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above. But since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, total number of 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that happens. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the hundreds place 4's go up to 488, so in the tens place, the 8's in 400-488 would be 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges \u00d7 10 + 1 range \u00d7 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

    "text": " From 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, the units place has 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, the last block is only up to 488, so 440-449 is a full block, but 480-488 is another partial block where the tens digit is 8, not 4. So, the blocks with tens digit 4 are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which is only 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, but how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, right? Wait, no, 480 is the first, then 481, up to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) has 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

    "text": " Maybe it's better to calculate it as (488 + 1) / 10, but I think it's more accurate to consider how many complete sets of 10 there are. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490), but wait, 488 is less than 490, so actually, from 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades (1-480) and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each decade, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, in the last partial decade (481-488), does the units digit include a 4? Yes, 484 is within this range. So, that's one more occurrence. So, total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then 14, 24, ..., 484. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The difference between consecutive terms is 10, so the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, yes, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, the last range is 400-488, but the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is within 400-488. So, how many full decades have a 4 in the tens place? Let's see:\n\n- 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers)\n- 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers)\n- 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers)\n- 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers)\n- 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers)\n\nSo that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall entirely within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, total 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the range 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The difference is 10, so number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many such ranges there are within 1-488:\n\n- 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers)\n- 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers)\n- 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers)\n- 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers)\n- 400-488: 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488. So, how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8, so numbers like 480,481,...,488 have tens digit 8? Wait no, 480 has tens digit 8? Wait, 480 is 4 (hundreds), 8 (tens), 0 (units). So yes, the tens digit is 8. Similarly, 481 has tens digit 8, and so on up to 488. So, how many numbers from 480 to 488 inclusive? That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. So, total in the tens place: 4 ranges with 10 each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 in 480-488. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds: 0. So total 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For the 4's, units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the 8's, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488.

There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. There are 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** None, as page numbers don't reach 800. 0 occurrences.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " The count should be 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 full tens, but since 484 is the 49th number, maybe it's 49 times? Wait, no, because 484 is the 49th occurrence of 4 in the units place. Because from 1 to 484, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then an extra 4 in 484. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 484 is 484, which is within 488, so yes, 49 times. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many times that is. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, and then an extra 8 in 488. So, 48 +1=49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, 49 times. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8, right? Let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, is that correct? 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers. So, the tens place 8 occurs in 480-488 as well. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 times. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, yes, 49 times. So, tens place:49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, 800 is beyond 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place:0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds:49 +49 +0=98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Correct. For the tens place of 4's, it's 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's five ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Units place for 4's: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 4,14,...484. 484 is the 49th occurrence. Correct. For 8's, units place:8,18,...488. 488 is the 49th occurrence. Correct. Tens place for 8's:80-89,180-189, etc., up to 480-488. Each of the first four ranges (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) has 10 numbers, and 480-488 has 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.

    "text": " From 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 gives 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, no, that might not be right. Because when you count from 4 to 484 with a step of 10, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 484 is within that range. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is another 10, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. So, how many terms? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8, so numbers are 480-488. That's 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, for the tens place, the ranges are: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For 8's: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. From 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, that's 50 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4, which would be in the range 400-488. How many numbers here? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these has 10 numbers. So, that's 4 ranges, each contributing 10, so 4 * 10 = 40. Wait, but does 380-389 go beyond 488? No, because 389 is less than 488. So, 40 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 89. Now, the difference is number of 4's minus number of 8's: 188 - 89 = 99. So, there are 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = \\frac{480}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, so:  \n     \\[\n     5 \\times 10 = 50\n     \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 4 appears in 400-488.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n     \\]\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 50 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 89 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = \\frac{480}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389.  \n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, so:  \n     \\[\n     4 \\times 10 = 40\n     \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: 0\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 40 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 0 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 89\n\\]\n\n**Difference:**  \n\\[\n188 \\, (\\text{number of 4's}) - 89 \\, (\\text{number of 8's}) = 99\n\\]\n\n\\boxed{99}"

    "text": " The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, how many blocks is that? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50 4's in the tens place. But wait, let me confirm. For each hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 1-488, how many hundreds are there? 488 is in the 400's. So, 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers). 101-200: 140-149 (10). 201-300: 240-249 (10). 301-400: 340-349 (10). 401-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is only 10 numbers, but 488 is higher. So, yes, 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 +50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many. The first is 8, last is 488. Using the same formula as before: ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let's count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)= 98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

    "text": " So from 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is (Last - First)/Step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. However, wait, the last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers. Let's count the blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. However, wait, the next block would be 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, the 480-488 range is part of this. So, in the tens place, how many 8's? From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480,481,...488 is 9 numbers). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9=49? Wait, no, because 480-488 is part of the hundreds place as well, but for the tens digit, it's still 8. So, the blocks are 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 4 blocks, but actually, it's 5 blocks, with the last one being only 9 numbers. So, total 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. Wait, in the tens place, I thought it was 49, but let me recount. The 8 in the tens place occurs in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 in the tens place. Units place is 49, so total 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. Then, tens place: 50, units place:49. Total 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (4, 14, 24, ..., 484)\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449)\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488)\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (8, 18, 28, ..., 488)\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488)\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences (no page numbers in 800-899)\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe it's better to think of it as (488 // 10) if the last digit is 4. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer division gives 48, but since 484 is within 488, we have 48 + 1 = 49 occurrences? Wait, no, because from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each complete set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. How many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? That's 48 full sets (since 48*10=480) and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, in each of the 48 sets, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48*1=48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total units place 4's: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So, how many blocks? 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place only in the numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these 89 numbers, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. So, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98; 98+89=187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many times this happens. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many terms in this sequence? It's an arithmetic sequence where a1=8, d=10, an=488. The nth term is given by a_n = a1 + (n-1)*d. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 8: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n=49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. Wait, but let me check: 488 is included, so from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, how many terms? Yes, 49 terms because (488-8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Each block from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 8's in the tens place, but the last block (480-488) contributes only 9 numbers (480-488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. Wait, no, 480-489 would have 10 numbers, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 numbers. But the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers, right? So, how many blocks? Let's see: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers). So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, so 4*10=40. The last block contributes 9, so total 40+9=49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 occurrences. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49+49=98. Now, the number of 4's was 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187-98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. 48+50=98; 98+89=187. That seems correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Yes, that seems right.

Solving for n: (n-1)*10 = 480 => n-1 = 48 => n=49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for a range of 10 numbers each time. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count these blocks. - From 40-49: 10 numbers. - From 140-149: another 10. - From 240-249: another 10. - From 340-349: another 10. - From 440-449: another 10. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, so 5*10=50. However, wait, the book only goes up to 488, so does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are.

So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if these are all within 488. - 80-89: yes. - 180-189: yes. - 280-289: yes. - 380-389: yes. The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but only 9 numbers instead of 10. So, let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds place 8's. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks of 10 (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449). There are 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. This totals 49 numbers.\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " From 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 gives 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 401-488. Wait, but the 4 in the tens place occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers. So, total 49+50+89=188. Okay, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see. The first is 8, last is 488. So, how many terms? (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let me check. Each block is 10 numbers. So, 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. The last block is from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me make sure I didn't overcount in the hundreds place for 4's. The hundreds place for 4's is from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. That's correct because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 is correct. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, I had 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 49. That seems right. So, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks.\n   - Total: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers from 800 to 488, so 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " If I consider each 10 numbers, from 1-10, 11-20, etc., each set of 10 has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1-480, that's 48 sets of 10, so 48 fours. Then, 481-488 would have 484 as the 49th occurrence. Wait, so actually, it's 49 fours in the units place. Hmm, maybe my initial thought was wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's better to calculate it as floor division. The number of 4's in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, the floor is 48. But wait, 480/10 is 48, so up to 480, there are 48 fours. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit cycles again, so 484 would be another 4. So that's 49 in total. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as (488 + 1) // 10 = 48.9, which is 48, but since 484 is within 488, it's 49. Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that for each digit position, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated by considering higher, current, and lower digits. Let me recall the formula for counting digit occurrences. For a given digit d in position p (units, tens, hundreds), the count can be calculated based on higher digits, current digit, and lower digits. Let me try applying this method for the units place first. For the units digit: We're looking for how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. The formula is: higher = number formed by digits higher than the current position. current = the digit in the current position. lower = number formed by digits lower than the current position. For units place, higher digits would be the number formed by the tens and hundreds places. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 480 / 10 = 48 blocks. So, 48 fours in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial block, 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, for the tens place: The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks are there up to 488. The blocks are: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So that's 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Now, for the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. Total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's. Units place: How many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to 4's, in every block of 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the partial block from 481 to 488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. So, in this partial block, 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Tens place: 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's see how many complete blocks there are. Each block contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, blocks are: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is a partial block. How many numbers are there from 480 to 488? That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) each contribute 10, and the last block contributes 9. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So total: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place 8's: 49. Hundreds place: 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the hundreds digit is 8. But the book goes up to 488, so the hundreds digits go up to 4 (since 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, 8 units). So, the hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. So total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because 188 seems high for 4's, and 98 for 8's. Let me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49 fours.\n\nTens place: 50 fours.\n\nHundreds place: 89 fours.\n\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nAnd for 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nTens place: 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal: 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place of 4's: each block of 100 has a 40-49 block, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours in the tens place per hundred. From 1-400, there are 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the 440-449 block is within this range, adding another 10 fours. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. That checks out.\n\nUnits place 4's: every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4. Then, in the partial block (481-488), 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, 48 +1=49.\n\nSo, yes, 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nTens place: 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm thinking, is there a way to cross-verify this? Maybe by considering that in each position, the count for 4 and 8 should be similar but not exactly the same because 4 is lower than 8, but in the hundreds place, 4 appears a lot because the book goes up to 488, whereas 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the total number of digits printed and see if the counts make sense, but that might be more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each position again to make sure.\n\nLet me try another approach for units place 4's:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place?\n\nThey are 4,14,24,...,484.\n\nThis is an arithmetic sequence where the first term a=4, common difference d=10.\n\nThe nth term is a + (n-1)d \u2264 488.\n\nSo, 4 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488.\n\n(n-1)*10 \u2264 484.\n\nn-1 \u2264 48.4.\n\nn \u2264 49.4, so n=49. So, 49 numbers with 4 in units place.\n\nSimilarly for 8's in units place:\n\nNumbers are 8,18,28,...,488.\n\nSame approach:\n\na=8, d=10.\n\nnth term: 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264488.\n\n(n-1)*10 \u2264480.\n\nn-1 \u226448.\n\nn=49.\n\nSo, 49 numbers with 8 in units place.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nTens place for 4's:\n\nNumbers where tens digit is 4: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449.\n\nEach block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 fours in tens place.\n\nTens place for 8's:\n\nNumbers where tens digit is 8: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488.\n\nEach block except the last has 10 numbers, contributing 10 eights. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, total 4*10 +9=49.\n\nSo, 49 eights in tens place.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each with 4 in hundreds place, so 89 fours.\n\nHundreds place for 8's: none, as the book ends at 488, so no page numbers from 800-899.\n\nSo, 0 eights in hundreds place.\n\nThus, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book is 188, while the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " If I consider the numbers from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers, which means 480/10 = 48 occurrences. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, making it the 49th occurrence. Wait, so that would be 49 times. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then an additional one in 484. So, 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This happens from page 400 to page 488. Each of these page numbers has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? From 1 to 488, the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, and then an additional one in 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total tens places: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, is that right? Let me confirm: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, yes, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This would occur from page 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in any page number.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " If I take 484 as the last one, then the count would be (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many complete ranges there are up to 488. The first range is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers. But I'm only counting when the hundreds digit is 4, which is from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so each contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many ranges? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 full ranges of 10 each and one range of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484.

    "text": " Maybe it's better to calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. So, for each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, total sets of 10 in 488 are 48 full sets (since 48*10=480) and then 8 more numbers (481-488). In each full set, 4 appears once, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (1 block). From 100-199: 140-149 (another block). Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many blocks? Let's see: each hundred has one block where the tens digit is 4. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So total 4's in the tens place: 5 blocks * 10 = 50. Wait, but from 400-488, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So 50 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. That would be from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. So total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (488). So total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 80-89 (1 block). From 100-199: 180-189 (another). From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, only 480-488 is considered, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many full blocks? The first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 numbers, so 4 blocks * 10 = 40. Then, the partial block in 480-488 adds 9 more. So total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 8 in tens place. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. Then 480-488: 9. So yes, 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10 and one partial set (481-488). Each set contributes one 4, so 48 + 1 = 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers.

Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So yes, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 all fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). Now, from 400-488: 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the hundreds place 4, the tens digit 8 only goes up to 488, which is 9 numbers instead of 10. So, how many ranges? The first four ranges (0-399) each have 10 numbers, and the last one (400-488) has 9. So total is 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count them: - 40-49: 10 numbers. - 140-149: 10 numbers. - 240-249: 10 numbers. - 340-349: 10 numbers. - 440-449: 10 numbers. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for page numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. Now, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is included. So, how many such numbers? Let's use the same method as before. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last range. Let me check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: How many numbers? 488 - 480 +1 = 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, we have 4 ranges with 10 numbers each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one range with 9 numbers (480-488). So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for page numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, the digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's are printed: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, in the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers. Let me confirm: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, the difference is indeed 90.

So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 4's in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see: The first block is 1-100, then 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is only up to 488. So, from 401-488, the tens place is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, and then 450-488 doesn't have a 4 in the tens place. So, let's count: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, 440-449: 10. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, in the last block, 440-449 is within 488, so it's valid. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, from page 400 to 488, each page number has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. Let's calculate how many there are. (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is only up to 488. So, how many blocks? 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9 (since 489 is beyond 488). So, 4 blocks with 10 each and 1 block with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

There are 49 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. There are 4 full blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " From 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's one range. Then each hundred has another range: 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five ranges in total. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for page numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence in units place is 488. How many numbers is that? Starting at 8, then 18, 28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the range for the hundreds place, but in the tens place, it's 480-489, but since the book stops at 488, the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, but earlier I thought of it as 10 numbers, but since 488 is the last page, it's actually 9 numbers for 480-488. Hmm, let me clarify. When considering the tens place, the 8 can be in the tens digit regardless of the hundreds digit. So, for each hundred, the tens digit 8 occurs in 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). However, in the case of 480-489, since the book only goes up to 488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five ranges, but the last one only has 9 numbers instead of 10. So, for the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each has 10 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40. The last range (480-488) has 9 numbers. So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. For each hundred, 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-489. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 in the tens place. So, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449. Let's count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, so for each hundred, there's one set. From 1-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, how many sets is that? 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 occurrences. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check again. Wait, 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the tens place. Let me recount the tens place. From 1-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is 10. From 200-299: 240-249 is 10. From 300-399: 340-349 is 10. From 400-488: 440-449 is 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. So, that's correct. And units place: 49, and hundreds place: 89. So total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, the last occurrence is 488. How many numbers? Using the same formula as before: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Adding up the 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For the 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.

So, the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, does that mean we have 49 occurrences? Wait, no, because 488 ends with an 8, not a 4. So, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 49th occurrence? Wait, no, let me think again. The first occurrence is 4, which is the 4th number. Then every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? The sequence is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1 = 48, so n=49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Hmm, that seems correct. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? Well, from 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 1-488, so that's valid. So, how many ranges? Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers. 140-149: 10. 240-249: 10. 340-349: 10. 440-449: 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is up to 449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, so let's see. The sequence is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that range. So, how many ranges? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times.

((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. Now, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. So, how many ranges? From 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 5 ranges, but the last one has only 9 numbers. So, for the first four ranges, each contributes 10 8's, so 4*10=40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above. But since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range has 10 terms, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 40, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers are in the 800s, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should calculate it as (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Hmm, that makes sense because from 4 to 484, inclusive, stepping by 10, gives 49 numbers. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449. Let me count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, so for each hundred, there's one set. From 1-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 occurrences. So, 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, in the hundreds place, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. Wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in the hundreds place, each of these numbers contributes a 4. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me check how many sets there are. From 1-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Now, how many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, each of the first four sets contributes 10, and the last set contributes 9. So, total in tens place: (4 x 10) +9 =40 +9=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 times 8 appears in the hundreds place. Adding up all occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =49 +49=98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 =90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99; 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, yes, that's correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, 484 is the 49th number where the units digit is 4. Because from 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 gives 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 440-449, which is within 488. Let's count how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but does 440-449 end at 449, which is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400-488. Wait, but the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488, right? So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because when considering the hundreds place, each number from 400 to 488 has 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me count how many full blocks there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So, yes, 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

    "text": " If I list them, starting from 4 as the first, each subsequent 4 is 10 pages apart. So, from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10 are there? The formula is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range, so yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. 400-488: 440-449, another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 4's. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is only the first digit, so each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me calculate how many times. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, using the same formula as before: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480s, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit here is 8 from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Let me check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers, but since we're only up to 488, this is fine. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, how many 8's in the tens place? For the first four ranges, each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. The last range contributes 9. So, total is 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me count again: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed.

    "text": " Wait, from 4 to 484, that's every 10 numbers, so the count should be (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 4's. Now, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. So, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 numbers = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, there are 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 8's. How many such ranges are there? From 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 8's in the tens place. Wait, but 480-489 would be another range, but since the book only goes up to 488, the numbers 480-488 are included, but only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct this. The tens place 8's occur in 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers). So that's 4 full ranges and one partial. So, total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Hmm, so earlier I thought it was 40, but actually, it's 49. Wait, but wait, let me think again. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So that's 5 ranges, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count each block: - 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. - 140-149: another 10. - 240-249: another 10. - 340-349: another 10. - 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Since our book ends at 488, 449 is within the range, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. So, there are 188 fours printed. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page. So, let's count each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the occurrences of 8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So, there are 98 eights printed. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488 \u2192 0 times.\n   \nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " The number of 4's in the units place would be (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, 484 is within 488, so yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in 1-99, 40-49 is one range (10 numbers). In 100-199, 140-149 is another (10 numbers). Similarly, 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 here. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these 89 numbers. Therefore, 89 times. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus the 4 in 484, which is the 49th. So, 49. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. There are 4 hundreds in 488: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, 400-488 is part of the 400s. So, in each hundred except maybe the last one, there's a full set of 10. So, 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). 100-199: 140-149 (10). 200-299: 240-249 (10). 300-399: 340-349 (10). 400-488: 440-449 (10). So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 50. So, 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 89. So total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last one is 488. So, how many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in 1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). In 100-199: 180-189 (10). In 200-299: 280-289 (10). In 300-399: 380-389 (10). Now, 400-488: The tens digit can be 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times, not 10. So, adding up: 4 ranges of 10 (from 1-399) and 1 range of 9 (400-488). So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counting. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 0-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges is 10 numbers, but the last one is only 9 because 488 is the last page. So, 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct. Similarly, for 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times. So, yes, the calculation seems correct. Therefore, the number of 4's exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " If I take 484 divided by 10, that's 48.4, so the integer part is 48, but since 484 is included, it should be 49. Because from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete decades (10s) plus any extra. The number of complete decades is 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete decades), and in each decade, the units digit 4 appears once. So that's 48 times, but wait, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? No, because 488 ends with 8. So, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is within the 480-489 range. So, from 1 to 488, the units digit 4 appears 48 times? Wait, no, because 488 is 488, so the units digit 4 appears in 4,14,...,484. Let's calculate it as floor(488 / 10) = 48, so 48 times. 2. **Tens place (second digit):** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, there's a block where the tens digit is 4. So, in 0-99, 40-49 is one block (10 numbers). In 100-199, 140-149 is another (10 numbers). Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 1-488, right? So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place (third digit):** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But we're only interested in how many times the hundreds digit is 4. Each of these 89 numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many times? The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. Wait, let me check: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place (second digit):** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, let's see: Each block contributes 10 numbers, except possibly the last one. Let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So total is 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, so 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but wait: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place (third digit):** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. So total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds =49+49+0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) -98 (8's)=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, this happens 48 times (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, taking the integer part).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers.

So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-489 isn't fully included. Wait, no, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, each set of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so the tens digit 4 would appear in 400-409, 410-419, etc., up to 440-449, but 450-488 would have tens digits from 5 to 8, so 440-449 is the last block with tens digit 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so from 40-49, 140-149, etc. Let's count the blocks: 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) 100-199: 140-149 (10) 200-299: 240-249 (10) 300-399: 340-349 (10) 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences. So 5 * 10 = 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4's appear 188 times.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many times. The first occurrence is 8, last is 488. Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only up to 488, so the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Let me check: from 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the tens place for 8's. When counting the tens place, I considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. So, for each hundred block except the last one, the 80-89, 180-189, etc., contribute 10 each. So, 0-99: 80-89 (10), 100-199:180-189 (10), 200-299:280-289 (10), 300-399:380-389 (10), and 400-488:480-488 (9). So that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 4*10 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 is correct.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify this. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the 4's or 8's. Let me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, step 10. The count is ((484 -4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, 5 blocks, so 50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89. So total 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks is 10, the last is 9. So 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 4, 14, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 8, 18, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe it's better to calculate it as (488 // 10) + (1 if the remainder is >=4 else 0). Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. Since 8 is greater than or equal to 4, we add 1. So, 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 4's. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49 (which is in the 40s), then 140s, 240s, 340s, and 440s. That's 5 ranges. So, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 numbers each = 50 4's. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the 440s go up to 449, which is within 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does it include 488? Yes, since 488 is page 488. So, let's calculate how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. Using the same method as before: 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. Since the remainder is 8, which is >=8, we add 1. So, 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last range is 480-488. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, contributing 10 8's each. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, for the tens place: 4 ranges \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 8's. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's. Similarly, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10. Then, 480-488: 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 onwards, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each range contributes 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488.

There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. Each range contributes 10, except the last which contributes 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me think about how many numbers between 1 and 488 have 4 in the units place. For each ten numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), there's exactly one number ending with 4. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Then, 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, actually, there are 49 4's in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, making it 49 times. Okay, so units place gives me 49 4's.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 for numbers from 40 to 49, 140 to 149, 240 to 249, 340 to 349, and 440 to 449. Let's see how many sets of ten there are where the tens digit is 4. Each set (like 40-49) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such sets are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49 (first set), 140-149 (second set), 240-249 (third set), 340-349 (fourth set), and 440-449 (fifth set). Each set contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, that's 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 4's. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's valid. So, tens place gives me 50 4's.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed are 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to the 4's, it's every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. So, how many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but including 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place gives 49 8's.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8. That happens in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each set contributes 10 numbers except the last one. Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488)\n\nSo, total 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 8's.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's:\n\n- Units: 49 (from 4,14,...,484). That seems correct because 484 is the 49th number.\n- Tens: 5 sets (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449), each with 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct.\n- Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units: 49 (from 8,18,...,488). Correct.\n- Tens: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So 10\u00d74 +9=49. Correct.\n- Hundreds: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Occurs every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Occurs in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, with 5 ranges in total.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Occurs in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Occurs every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Occurs in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 each contribute 10 numbers, and 480-488 contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So starting at 4 and adding 10 each time: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is indeed the last 4 in the units place before 490, which is beyond the book's pages. So yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's one range. Then 140-149: another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 4's, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so that's a partial range. Let me count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 4 full ranges (each 10) and one partial range with 9. So total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.
