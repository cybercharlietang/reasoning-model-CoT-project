    "text": " That's from 4 to 484, which is 484 - 4 = 480, and 480 / 10 = 48, but since we include both endpoints, it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The number of times a digit appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10. So, for numbers from 1 to N, the count is floor(N / 10). But since 488 is the total, I need to adjust. Wait, no, I'm considering each digit position separately. So, for the units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, but since 488 is the upper limit, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me use a formula: the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor((N + 1) / 10). So for d=4, it's floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48. So 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences. How many such ranges are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 1-100, 40-49: 10 times. 101-200: 140-149: 10 times. 201-300: 240-249: 10 times. 301-400: 340-349: 10 times. 401-488: 440-449: 10 times. Wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 times, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, which is correct. So total 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4, so every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 48 times. Tens place: 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 89 numbers. 48+50=98, +89=187. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process. 1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place from 1 to 488? Using the same formula as before, floor((488 +1)/10)= floor(489/10)=48. So 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that range. So, each of these ranges contributes 10 times except possibly the last one. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So that's 4 full ranges (each 10) and one partial range with 9. So total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be in numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So 0 times. Now, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 49 + 0 = 97. Wait, let me check again. Units: 48. Tens: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. So 48+49=97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So 187 (number of 4's) minus 97 (number of 8's) equals 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because 187-97=90. But I'm not sure if I did the counts correctly. Let me verify the counts again. For 4's: Units place: 48 times. Tens place: 50 times. Hundreds place:89 times. Total: 48+50=98 +89=187. For 8's: Units place:48. Tens place:49. Hundreds place:0. Total:97. So 187-97=90. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. Let me think again: from 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488-400+1=89. So that's correct. So 89 times in the hundreds place. And the tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Units place:48. So 48+50+89=187. For 8's: Units place:48. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 ranges, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers. So 4 full ranges (each 10) and one partial with 9, so 4*10 +9=49. So 48+49=97. So 187-97=90. Yeah, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 times (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484)\n- **Tens place:** 50 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 times (e.g., 400-488)\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 times (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488)\n- **Tens place:** 49 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 times\n\n**Total 8's:** 48 + 49 + 0 = 97\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " That's 484 divided by 10, which is 48.4, so 48 full tens, but since 484 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, because 484 is the 49th number where 4 is in the units place. So maybe I should calculate it as (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Hmm, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so does 484 exist? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 49. Wait, but let me think again. If I count from 4 to 484 in steps of 10, how many terms are there? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. So, 5 ranges \u00d710 numbers each =50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 -400 +1 =89. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) =49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. The last occurrence is 488. So, how many? Using the same method: ((488-8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389. Each range has 10 numbers. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: 80-89 is the first, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges. So, 4\u00d710=40. But wait, does 380-389 exist? Yes, because 389 is less than 488. So, 40 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above. But the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) =49+40=89. So, 89 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) -89 (number of 8's)=99. Therefore, there are 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 \u2192 40 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488 \u2192 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 40 + 0 = 89.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 89 (8's) = 99.\n\n\\boxed{99}"

    "text": " Each step is +10, so starting at 4, the nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. Let me solve for n when the term is 484: 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484 \u2192 (n-1)*10 = 480 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. Wait, but the last page is 488, so 484 is within the range. So, yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's one set, 140-149: another, 240-249: third, 340-349: fourth, and 440-449: fifth. So, 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, 449 is less than 488, so all 5 sets are valid. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 188 4's. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488 \u2192 (n-1)*10 = 480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8's appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many full sets we have. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, total 4 full sets of 10 and one partial set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, let me double-check: from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's here. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 98 8's. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract 98 from 188: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

    "text": " The number of terms in this sequence is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's one set. Then each hundred has another set: 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets in total (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Each set contributes 10 fours, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 here, so how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Wait, no, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but wait, does the hundreds place actually go up to 488? So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's see how many sets there are. From 80-89: that's one set. Then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So that's 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, 480-488, which has 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, for the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributes 10 eights, so 4*10=40. The last set, 480-488, contributes 9 eights. So total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. When I counted the tens place, I had 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49, correct. So total eights: 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-489 isn't fully included because the book ends at 488. Let me calculate each block: - 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. - 140-149: Another 10. - 240-249: Another 10. - 340-349: Another 10. - 440-449: Another 10. Now, from 450 to 488, the tens digit doesn't include 4 anymore, so no more occurrences in the tens place beyond 449. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, in the 40-49 range, that's correct, but let me check if 440-449 is fully within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 occurrences of the digit 4. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are.

So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the 480-489 range only goes up to 488. So, let's count each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: Here, it's not a full block. From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, how many 8's? Each block contributes 10, except the last one, which contributes 9. So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 occurrences of the digit 8. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in any page number.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's one range. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences. But wait, 440-449 is only up to 449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me count how many such ranges there are. 80-89: that's one range. Then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. So, that's four ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 occurrences. Wait, but does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but 488 is the last page. So, 480-488 is part of the range, but since 488 is the last page, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. Wait, so that's another range. So, from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five ranges. The first four ranges are complete, each with 10 numbers, but the last range, 480-488, has only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no: 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488). So, the tens digit is 8 in these numbers. So, how many occurrences is that? 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, total in the tens place: 4 ranges \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above. But the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

    "text": " The difference between each is 10, so the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many times 4 appears here. Each block of ten numbers (like 40-49) has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one block, that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, so that's 20. Then 240-249: 30, and 340-349: 40. Next, 440-449: but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within that. So, how many blocks? Let's see: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (20), 240-249 (30), 340-349 (40), and 440-449 (50). Each block contributes 10 4's, so 5 blocks would be 50. But wait, let me check the last block: 440-449 is 10 numbers, but does 449 exist? Yes, because 488 is the last page, so 449 is included. So, that's 5 blocks, each with 10 4's, so 5*10=50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. Let's calculate: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, but I should double-check that. 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. The number of numbers is indeed 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. 180-189: another 10, so 20. 280-289: 30. 380-389: 40. Now, 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, each of these has an 8, so that's 9 more 8's. So, total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, that seems off. Let me think again. Each block from 0-99: 80-89 is 10 8's. Then 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Then 480-488: 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 to 899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: \\( \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 4's, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in page numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:**\n\\[ 49 \\text{ (units)} + 50 \\text{ (tens)} + 89 \\text{ (hundreds)} = 188 \\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: \\( \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 8's except the last block, which has 9 numbers.\n   - Total: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:**\n\\[ 49 \\text{ (units)} + 49 \\text{ (tens)} + 0 \\text{ (hundreds)} = 98 \\]\n\n**Difference:**\n\\[ 188 \\text{ (number of 4's)} - 98 \\text{ (number of 8's)} = 90 \\]\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: From 1-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers) From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers) From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers) From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, 10 numbers). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is okay. So, how many blocks? From 1-99: 1 block of 10, so 10 numbers. From 100-199: another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 10, 300-399: 10, and 400-488: 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 occurrences. Wait, but wait: 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but wait: 400-488 is 89 numbers, but the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 occurrences of the digit 4. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence is 488. Let me calculate how many terms there are. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, for 10 consecutive numbers each time. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488). So, let's break it down: From 1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers) From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers) From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers) From 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last page). So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

    "text": " The sequence is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. Solving for n: 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1 = 48, so n = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Let's count these blocks. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, each subsequent block adds another 10. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? The blocks are at 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences. So, 5*10 = 50 occurrences. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers. For example, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 49 occurrences (since 8 appears at 8, 18, ..., 488). Let me confirm: starting at 8, each step adds 10. The nth term is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. Solving: 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1 = 48, so n = 49. So, 49 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these blocks. From 80-89: 10 numbers. Similarly, each block adds 10. How many such blocks are there up to 488? The blocks are at 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be the next block, but since the book only goes up to 488, the block 480-489 isn't fully included. So, only up to 380-389 is fully within 488. So, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences. So, 4*10 = 40 occurrences. But wait, let me check: from 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 blocks, so 40. But wait, what about 480-488? The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the numbers 480-488 have 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's an additional 9 occurrences. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's are printed than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None \u2192 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " From 4 to 484, each step is 10, so the number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, each number has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit. So, ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-489, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, for the hundreds place, the 400-488 range contributes 9 8's in the tens place. So, total in tens place: 4 ranges with 10 each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe task is to determine how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Number of 4's:**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 4 to 484, there are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit):** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit):** 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Number of 8's:**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit):** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit):** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " The difference between each is 10, so the number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are. Since the book goes up to 488, the last block would be 440-449. So, from 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 * 10 = 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, but the hundreds digit is only 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many blocks: 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last page). So, the first four blocks each have 10 8's, and the last block has 9. So, total 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the Digit 4:**\n1. **Units Place (4, 14, 24, ..., 484):** There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens Place (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449):** There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds Place (400-488):** There are 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the Digit 8:**\n1. **Units Place (8, 18, 28, ..., 488):** There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens Place (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488):** There are 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** There are 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, for 10 consecutive numbers each time. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449. Let me count how many sets there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one set, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fit within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But since we're only looking at the hundreds digit, each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence is 488. How many such numbers? Let's see: The first is 8, and the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, for 10 consecutive numbers each time. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 count? But the book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let me count the sets. From 0-99: 80-89, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many 8's in the tens place? The first four sets each contribute 10, so 4\u00d710=40. The last set from 480-488 contributes 9 8's. So total 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188-98=90. Yes, that seems right.

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49 (that's 10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check the last one: 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. Let's count each range: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10 numbers. 280-289: 10 numbers. 380-389: 10 numbers. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 is included, and 488 is the end). So, that's 4 ranges with 10 numbers each and one range with 9 numbers. So total is 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, let me double-check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. Yes, that adds up to 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, I subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: Units place: 49, Tens place:50, Hundreds place:89. Total: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: Units place:49, Tens place:49, Hundreds place:0. Total:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I feel like maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me check the tens place for 4's. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct. For 8's in the tens place, we had 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's five ranges, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Units place for both digits: 4's go up to 484, which is 484-4=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. Similarly for 8's, up to 488, so same calculation: 49. Hundreds place for 4's: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. Hundreds place for 8's: none, since the book ends at 488. So, 0. So, the calculations seem correct. Therefore, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

This is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four ranges have 10 numbers each, and the last has 9, totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such blocks there are: - 40-49: 10 numbers - 140-149: 10 numbers - 240-249: 10 numbers - 340-349: 10 numbers - 440-449: 10 numbers But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, 5 blocks each with 10 numbers: 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Wait, let me check that addition again. 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count the blocks: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 numbers - 280-289: 10 numbers - 380-389: 10 numbers Now, does 480-489 count? Well, 488 is the last page, so 480-488 would be part of the hundreds place. But since we're looking at the tens place, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but the book only goes up to 488. So, from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480-489 is a full block, but since the book ends at 488, we have 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, let me adjust. The blocks are: - 80-89: 10 - 180-189: 10 - 280-289: 10 - 380-389: 10 - 480-488: 9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9) So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the hundreds place as well, but in the tens place, it's the 8. So, yes, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. When I considered 480-488, does that count as 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8? Yes, because 480 has 8 in the tens place, 481, 482, ..., up to 488. So that's 9 numbers. So, the tens place for 8 is 49. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again. For the 4's: Units: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total: 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 8. Let me recount. The tens digit is 8 in the following ranges: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds: total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

    "text": " Each step increases by 10, so the count is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences. However, wait a second, does the last range go up to 449, which is before 488? Yes, so that's correct. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, that's 89 occurrences. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 occurrences of the digit 4. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so I need to check that. Let's count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 ranges with 10 each and 1 range with 9. So, total is 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences per range. How many such ranges are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, we have 0-4. So, the tens digit 4 appears in the ranges 40-49 (first hundred), 140-149 (second hundred), 240-249 (third hundred), 340-349 (fourth hundred), and 440-449 (fifth hundred). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's here. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so from 8 to 488, how many numbers? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. So, let's count how many ranges: 80-89 (first hundred), 180-189 (second hundred), 280-289 (third hundred), 380-389 (fourth hundred), and 480-488 (fifth hundred). So, 5 ranges. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 4 * 10 = 40. The fifth range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. Let's subtract 400 from 488 and add 1: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, there are 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. Wait, but the hundreds digit is only 4 in the range 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with an 8. So, let's calculate how many numbers have 8 in the units place. The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? Let's use the formula: ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's see how many full blocks there are. The first four blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10 numbers. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, total occurrences: 4 blocks *10=40, plus 9 from the last partial block, totaling 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within that range, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Wait, no, I'm talking about the tens place. So, for each hundred, the tens place is 4 for 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. Let's see how many full hundreds we have. From 1-99: 40-49 is one set, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440 is included in 400-488. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens place is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 5 sets, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Wait, 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The difference is 488-8=480, divided by 10 is 48, so 48+1=49 numbers. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. From 1-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289, 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389, 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, how many times does 8 appear? For the first four sets, each contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480-488). So, total in the tens place is 40+9=49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480 is included and 488 is the last. So, yes, 9 numbers. So, tens place: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place: 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - There are 5 such sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 numbers.\n   - Total: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - The first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - In 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480-488).\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, the last range is 440-449, but our book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488. So, all 5 ranges are valid. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. To find the count: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is valid, but 489 isn't included. So, let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So total is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449. Let me count how many full decades there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one set, that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 is another 10, 340-349 is another 10, and 440-449 is another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 occurrences, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, let's count each set. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189 is 10. 200-299: 280-289 is 10. 300-399: 380-389 is 10. 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, adding these up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

    "text": " The sequence starts at 4 and increments by 10 each time. The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10 => 480 = (n-1)*10 => n-1 = 48 => n=49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place, 4 can appear in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50. But wait, from 400-488, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 450-488 is beyond that, so that's okay. So, total 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 occurrences of the digit 4. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in units place is 488. Let me calculate how many such numbers. The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10 => 480 = (n-1)*10 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So, that's 9 numbers instead of 10. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place, the 400-488 block only has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Wait, let me check that again. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check the counts. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that makes sense. Let me just make sure I didn't miss any numbers or double-count. For units place of 4: from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers, so 49 times. For tens place of 4: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449, which is 5 blocks of 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49 (since the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but the other blocks are 10 each, so 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, total 49). So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

From 300-399: 380-389 is another 10. From 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, no 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This is 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This is 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear. This is 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " The sequence is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. Solving for n: 10*(n-1) = 480 => n-1 = 48 => n = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, from 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences. How many such blocks are there? Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 occurrences. Wait, but does the last block go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, 449 is less than 488, so all 5 blocks are fully included. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. The sequence is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. Solving: 10*(n-1)=480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 numbers. How many such blocks are there? The hundreds digit can be 0 (for 80-89), 1 (180-189), 2 (280-289), 3 (380-389). Wait, but 80-89 is in the two-digit numbers, so from 1 to 488, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks is 10 numbers, so 4 blocks. But wait, 80-89 is within 1-488, so that's valid. So, 4 blocks *10=40 occurrences. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 another 10, 280-289 another 10, and 380-389 another 10. So, 40 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49+40=89. So, 89 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 99. So, there are 99 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4 \u2192 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Number of blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Occurrences per block: 10.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in page numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of pages: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 380-389.\n   - Number of blocks: 4 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).\n   - Occurrences per block: 10.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in 800-899, so 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **89**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 89 (8's) = **99**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{99}"

So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 5*10 = 50 occurrences. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the sequence is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1 = 48, so n = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the first four ranges, each has 10 numbers, and the last one has 9. So, total tens place occurrences: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems a bit high. Let me verify each step again. For 4's: units place was 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check the tens place again. From 0-99: 80-89 (10). 100-199:180-189 (10). 200-299:280-289 (10). 300-399:380-389 (10). 400-488:480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 + 9=49. That's correct. So, 98 8's. So, 188-98=90.

Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, and so on up to 440-449. That's 5 blocks in total (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 numbers each = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, each block except the last one has 10 numbers. Let's count: 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 onwards. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

    "text": " The pattern is every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let me think differently. For each set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? That's 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. So, there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, which gives 48 fours. But wait, the last set is from 481-490, but our book ends at 488, so the units digit 4 occurs in 484, which is within 481-490. So, yes, it's 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49: that's one. Then 140-149: another. 240-249: another. 340-349: another. 440-449: another. So that's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 fours, so 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, our book ends at 488, so does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, all 5 ranges are fully included. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many times that is. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms can be calculated as ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. So, let's count each range: - 80-89: 10 eights. - 180-189: 10 eights. - 280-289: 10 eights. - 380-389: 10 eights. - 480-488: 9 eights (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488). So, total eights in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights here. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are.

However, I need to check if the last block, 440-449, is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting at 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many times. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count the blocks: 80-89 (1), 180-189 (2), 280-289 (3), 380-389 (4), and 480-488 (5). Each full block (except the last one) contributes 10 numbers. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, the first four blocks contribute 4 x 10 = 40, and the last block contributes 9. So, total in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the difference is number of 4's minus number of 8's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10th number, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is every 10th number, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 40, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449. Let me count how many full decades there are. Each full decade (like 0-99, 100-199, etc.) has one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, so that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. Wait, but let me confirm: from 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=49+50=99+89=188. That seems correct. For the 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. Wait, when I was counting the tens place for 8's, I included 480-488 as 9 numbers. Let me confirm: from 480 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers? 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9. So that's correct. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. So, that's correct. Now, just to make sure I didn't overcount anywhere. For the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right. For the tens place of 4's, I had 5 sets: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Units place for 4's: from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers, so 49 times. Correct. For 8's, units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 times. Tens place: 80-89,180-189, etc., up to 480-488, which is 49 times. So, 98 total 8's. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " That's 49 numbers because starting from 4 as the first, each step adds 10. So, 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. Solving for n: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges exist up to 488. The ranges are 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, let me calculate each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289:10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488:9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For the 4's: Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total: 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total:98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For the tens place, 4's: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 50. That's correct. Units place for 4's: 4,14,...,484. 484 is 480 +4, so (484-4)/10=48, so 48+1=49. Correct. For 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place for 8's: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. When counting the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. But wait, 400 is included, so 488-400+1=89. Correct. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, total 4's: 49+50+89=188. 8's:49+49=98. Difference:90. So, the answer is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe I missed something, but I think the calculations are correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers).

So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. So, 188 occurrences of the digit 4. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. To count how many: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). Now, 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since our book ends at 488, only 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place occurrences: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4*10=40, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 occurrences of the digit 8. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8, but the units digit goes from 0-8, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 488 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have 4 full ranges of 10 numbers each, and one partial range with 9 numbers. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So, total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences here. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. Difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. When I counted the tens place, I considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. Wait, in the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8, right? So, 480 has 8 in the tens place, 481, 482, ..., up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers. So, 4 full decades (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, and one partial decade (480-488) contributing 9. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. That seems correct. Similarly, for 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 is correct. So, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, from 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Let's see how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), the next is 140-149 (another 10), and so on. The last block before 488 would be 440-449. How many blocks are there? From 0 to 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4 (since 488 is less than 500). So, the tens digit 4 can appear in the tens place in the hundreds blocks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's printed. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, similar to the 4's, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, let's count each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 numbers - 280-289: 10 numbers - 380-389: 10 numbers - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488). So, total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's printed. Finally, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - There are 5 such blocks, each contributing 10 numbers: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Number of terms: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in any page numbers since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of terms: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each step is +10, so from 4 to 484 is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many such sets there are. Each set has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many sets are there? From 40-49 (that's one set), then 140-149 (second), 240-249 (third), 340-349 (fourth), and 440-449 (fifth). So, 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 here. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these sets. Each set has 10 numbers. How many sets are there? 80-89 is one set, 180-189 is second, 280-289 is third, 380-389 is fourth. So, 4 sets, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40 times. Wait, but does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, but 480-488 is part of the page numbers. So, 480-488 is another set where the tens digit is 8. That's the fifth set. So, 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers. So, does that affect the count? Let me think. Normally, each set like 80-89 has 10 numbers, but 480-488 has only 9. So, for the tens place, how many times does 8 appear? For the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributes 10. The fifth set is 480-488, which contributes 9. So, total is 4*10 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. Hmm, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, I think I made a mistake before when I thought it was 5*10=50. It's actually 4*10 + 9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, it's valid. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each number in this range has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers except possibly the last one if it's cut short. Let's check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: Here, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, this range contributes 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

    "text": " The difference between each is 10, so the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many times 4 appears here. Each block of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks of 100, so 4 * 10 = 40 occurrences. Now, from 400-488, the tens place is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, no. Wait, from 1-400, each 100 has 10, so 4*10=40. Then from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, meaning 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, let's count: Each block of 100 has 10 occurrences in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 blocks, so 4*10=40. Then from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1=9. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, no, because 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we stop at 488, it's 9. So, 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " Each of these is 4 more than a multiple of 10. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 49 because 484 is the 49th term (since 484 = 4 + (48-1)*10). Wait, maybe I should calculate it differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and taking the integer part, then adding 1 if the last number in that position is reached. Alternatively, perhaps a better way is to consider each range separately. Let me think again. For units place 4's: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 48*10=480, and 480 +4=484, which is within 488. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 +1=49? Wait, no. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the number of complete decades is 48, each contributing one 4. So that's 48. But then, the last number ending with 4 is 484, which is 48*10 +4, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is the last page, which is 488, so 484 is within the range. So, from 1 to 488, the number of numbers ending with 4 is 49. Let me verify: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Yes, that's correct. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these decades contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such decades there are. The book has up to 488 pages, so the hundreds place can be 0 (for 1-99), 1, 2, 3, or 4. But 440-449 is within 488, but 450-459 would be beyond 488, but 440-449 is okay. So, how many decades have 4 in the tens place? Let's list them: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 decades, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So that's 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), or 4 (400-488). So, when does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Only in 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** How many numbers end with 8? From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers has one number ending with 8. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8. But wait, the last number ending with 8 is 488 itself. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence. Let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is ((488-8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in decades like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 decade. Let's count how many full decades and partial decades we have. The decades are: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last page). So, each of the first four decades contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the last one contributes 9. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can be 0 (1-99),1(100-199),2(200-299),3(300-399),4(400-488). So, when does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Only if the hundreds digit is 8, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. The difference is 188-98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each step increases by 10, so the number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 401-488. Let's see how many full blocks there are before 400. The blocks are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. That's four blocks. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last block, 401-488, how many 4's are in the tens place? From 401 to 409, the tens digit is 0, so no 4's there. From 410 to 419, tens digit is 1, so no. Similarly, up to 488, the tens digit is 8, which is different. Wait, actually, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 1 for 410-419, 2 for 420-429, 3 for 430-439, 4 for 440-449, and then 5-8 for the higher ranges, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digits go up to 8. So, in the 401-488 block, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's. So total 4's in the tens place: 4 * 10 (from the first four blocks) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. Wait, but earlier I thought the last block was 401-488, but actually, in the 401-488 block, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens place 4's: 4 * 10 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. So total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. Now, let me check if I did that right. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count: How many full blocks are there before 400? 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers), 101-200:180-189 (10), 201-300:280-289 (10), 301-400:380-389 (10). That's four blocks, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, in the 401-488 block, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 8's in the tens place here. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check that again. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. So, 400 is the first page with 4 in the hundreds place, and 488 is the last. The count is 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So that's correct. For the tens place of 4's, I had 50. Let me recount: in the first four blocks (1-400), each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. So total 50. That seems correct. For units place, both 4's and 8's have 49 each. So, 4's total 188, 8's total 98, difference 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: \\( \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 4's, so \\( 4 \\times 10 = 40 \\) from the first four blocks.\n   - In 401-488, 440-449 contributes another 10.\n   - Total: \\( 40 + 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: \\( \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's, so \\( 4 \\times 10 = 40 \\).\n   - In 401-488, 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total: \\( 40 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:** \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " From 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449. Let's calculate how many full sets of 100 there are. From 1-488, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), or 4 (400-488). So, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? In each hundred block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, for 1-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. For 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, and 488 is beyond that, so that's fine. So, each hundred block contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many hundred blocks are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, that's 5 blocks. Wait, but 400-488 is not a full hundred; it's only up to 488. So, does the tens place in 400-488 have 10 occurrences (440-449)? Yes, because 440-449 is within 400-488. So, each of the 5 blocks contributes 10, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, let me check the last block, 400-488. The tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, total 4's in the tens place: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Wait, but I'm counting the digit 4, so yes, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence is 488. How many terms? Let's see: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences of 8 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 block. So, let's count each block. From 1-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 how many numbers? 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). Wait, but in the tens place, 8 is in the tens digit, so 480-488 is 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, for the 400-488 block, tens digit 8 occurs 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 1-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed.

From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. For the tens place of 4's: each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, etc.) contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. There are 5 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but in the 400-488 block, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 5 blocks \u00d710=50, which is correct. Units place: 49, correct. So, 49+50+89=188, correct.\n\nFor the 8's: units place is 49, correct. Tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (1-399) and one block of 9 (400-488), totaling 49. Correct. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484.

    "text": " The numbers go from 4 to 484 with a step of 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in each hundred, there are 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Since 488 is less than 500, we have four full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 400-488. Let's count: - 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers - 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers - 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers - 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers - 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so yes, 5 sets. So 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, there are 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such ranges are there. From 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. Now, 400-488: does 480-489 exist? Yes, but since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, for 400-488, we have 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 0-399) and 9 from 400-488. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n   \n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   \n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   \n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n   \n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - There are 4 full ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributing 10 each, and 9 numbers in 480-488.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n   \n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0.\n   \n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " The difference between each is 10, so the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. The first range is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is okay because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). But how many 4's are in the hundreds place? Each of these 89 numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check: 400 to 488 is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Let's count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 numbers - 280-289: 10 numbers - 380-389: 10 numbers - 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's recount the 4's: - Units: 4,14,...,484. As I calculated earlier, 49. - Tens: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50. - Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now for the 8's: - Units: 8,18,...,488. That's 49. - Tens: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. - Hundreds: 0. So, total 8's=49+49=98. Therefore, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Total numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
