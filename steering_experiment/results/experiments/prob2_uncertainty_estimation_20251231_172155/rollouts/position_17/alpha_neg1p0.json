    "text": " That's 48 intervals of 10, so 49 numbers in total. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Let me count how many such sets there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449 each add 10 numbers. Now, how many such sets are there? From 0-99: 1 set. From 100-199: 1 set. From 200-299: 1 set. From 300-399: 1 set. From 400-488: 440-449 is another set, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, the last set is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in all these numbers. So, that's 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many numbers that is. The first is 8, the last is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but similar to the 4's, the number of 8's in the units place would be 49. Because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me count the sets. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is another 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is another 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is another 10. From 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place for 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and 1 set of 9 (480-488). So, that's 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear \u2192 0 times.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " That's 48/10 = 4.8, but since 484 is the 49th term, maybe I should think differently. Alternatively, the number of terms can be calculated as (last term - first term)/common difference + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, the last block is 440-449, but our book goes up to 488. So, 440-449 is entirely within 488, so it's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through each digit position similarly: 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same method as before: (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Now, how many such blocks are there? Let's check: 80-89 is the first, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks. Each has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. But wait, does 380-389 fall within 488? Yes, because 389 is less than 488. So, 40 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) = 49 + 40 = 89. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 89 (8's) = 99. Wait, that can't be right because earlier when I added up the 4's, I had units (49), tens (50), hundreds (89), totaling 188. And for 8's, units (49) and tens (40), totaling 89. So, 188 - 89 = 99. Hmm, but I feel like maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check the counts. For 4's: units place: 4,14,...,484. Let me see, from 4 to 484, how many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/difference) +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 488 -400 +1=89. Correct. So total 4's:49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place:8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10. That's 4 blocks, each 10, so 40. Correct. Hundreds place: none, as 800-899 is beyond 488. So total 8's:49+40=89. So, 188-89=99. So, the answer should be 99 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I missed something. For example, in the hundreds place for 4's, 400-488: that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. But wait, does 488 have a 4 in the hundreds place? Yes, because 488 is 4 (hundreds), 8 (tens), 8 (units). So, yes, it's included. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, 380-389: 380 is 3 (hundreds), 8 (tens), 0 (units). So, that's correct. I think my counts are accurate. So, the difference is 99.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 89. The difference is 188 - 89 = 99.\n\n$\\boxed{99}$"

    "text": " That's 49 numbers because from 4 to 484, each step is 10, so (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Let's count the number of such blocks. The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, the last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, pages 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. So, how many blocks do we have? 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers). So, the first four blocks contribute 4 * 10 = 40, and the last block contributes 9. So, total 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

    "text": " That's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so I think I made a mistake earlier. It's actually 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49 up to 440-449, that's 5 ranges (since 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449). So that's 5 ranges \u00d7 10 numbers each = 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range has 10 numbers. How many such ranges are there? From 80-89 up to 380-389, that's 4 ranges. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times. Wait, does 480-489 count? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 would be 9 numbers. So, actually, the 8 in the tens place would be in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So that's 5 ranges, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, for the first four ranges, it's 10 each, and the last one is 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Hmm, that seems a bit off. Wait, let me think again. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, and the last one has 9. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 49 is 98, but earlier I thought maybe 49 + 40 + 0 = 89, but now it's 98. Let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 in the tens place. So total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Wait, but earlier when I thought of the hundreds place, I said 0, so total 98. But wait, is that correct? Let me check the units place again. Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488. Solving for n: 10(n-1) = 480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 terms. That's correct. Similarly, in the tens place, as above, 49 terms. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's was 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but that seems like a big difference. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me recount the 4's. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. Number of terms: (484 - 4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. For 8's: Units place:49, Tens place:49, Hundreds:0. Total 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in higher places, it's easy to make an off-by-one error. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 400 is the first, 488 is the last. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1=89. Correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, for the tens place of 8's, I had 49. Let me make sure that's correct. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, the difference is indeed 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as the book doesn't reach 800.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, the units place has 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine.

So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, I can calculate (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me check if 480-489 is within the book's pages. Since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is included. So, that's another set: 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, each set of ten contributes 10 eights except the last one, which contributes 9. Let me count the sets: 80-89: 10 eights. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, total eights in the tens place: (4 * 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " That's 484 - 4 divided by 10 plus 1. So (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers, 10 4's. From 140-149: another 10 4's. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449 each contribute 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's. So 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 count? The book goes up to 488, so yes, 440-449 is within the range. So that's 50 4's. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through each digit position as well: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers, not 10. Let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 8's. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers.

    "text": " The number of terms in this sequence can be calculated by (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Let's count how many such sets there are. From 1 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, except possibly the last one if it exceeds 488. Let's check 440-449: 440 is within 488, so all 10 numbers are valid. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. Let's see how many numbers that is. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. The total number of such numbers is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. However, since we're only counting the hundreds digit, each of these numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same method as before: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within 488. 480-489 is within 488, but since the book ends at 488, the last number in this range is 488, which is valid. So, that's 5 sets: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, actually, each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) have 10 numbers, and the last set (480-488) has 9 numbers. So, total occurrences in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences here. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Finally, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " The number of terms in this sequence is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so actually, there are 49 occurrences in the units place. I think I made a mistake earlier by taking the integer part. Let me correct that. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences in units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of times 8 appears. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let me calculate how many ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, the first four ranges contribute 4 * 10 = 40, and the last range contributes 9. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up the occurrences: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the 4's and 8's.\n\nFirst, for the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49 times (from 4, 14, ..., 484). Correct.\n- Tens place: 5 ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49 times (from 8, 18, ..., 488). Correct.\n- Tens place: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, so the difference is 90. That seems correct. But let me check if I counted correctly for the hundreds place of 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89. Yes, that's correct. And for the 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers. So, that's correct. So, I think my calculation is correct, and the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range has 10 numbers, totaling 5 ranges.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages 400 to 488.\n   - Number of pages: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four ranges: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Last range: 480-488 has 9 numbers.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages from 800 onwards, so 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " That's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first block, 140-149 is the second, up to 440-449. That's five blocks in total. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 numbers per block = 50 times. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Let's calculate: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, in these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are.

So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89 is the first, 180-189 is the second, 280-289 is the third, and 380-389 is the fourth. So, four blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times. Wait, but does 380-389 go beyond 488? No, because 389 is less than 488. So, that's fine. So, 40 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, there are 89 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 89 = 99.

    "text": " That's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which would be 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only when the page number is between 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the number of 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, checking each digit place: 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, starting from 8, the last occurrence is 488. Let's calculate how many numbers that is. The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The difference between each term is 10, so the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers. Let's count how many such blocks there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-489 would be another block, but since the book only goes up to 488, the 480-488 range is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus the partial block 480-488, which has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but actually, in the tens place, 480-488: the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the number of 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 times. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488 \u2192 0 times.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " That's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for a block of 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49 (pages 40-49), then 140-149 (pages 140-149), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? Let me check: 440-449 is within 488, so it's valid. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. Let's see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, then 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me check each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: This is from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the first four blocks each have 10 numbers, and the last block has 9. So total in the tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Finally, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers here \u2192 0 times.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " The number of terms in this sequence is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many sets of 10 numbers there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Similarly, each hundred has another 10. So, for 40-49: 10, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does the last set go up to 488? 440-449 is within 488, so yes, it's valid. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Let's see, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 4's. Now, let's add them up: Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. Total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 count? Yes, because the units digit is 8. Let's count how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, total in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's: Units place:49, Tens place:49, Hundreds place:0. Total 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

    "text": " That's actually (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, that makes sense because each decade (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place, except possibly the last one if it doesn't reach 488. But since 484 is within 488, it's included. So, units place has 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's see how many complete ranges we have. The first range is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So that's 5 * 10 = 50 fours. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Let's see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting at 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many times this happens. The last occurrence is at 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count how many ranges there are. 80-89 is the first, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges, each with 10 eights, so 4 * 10 = 40 eights. Now, does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, but 480-489 would be the next range, but our book ends at 488. So, 480-488 is part of this range. However, in the tens place, it's still 8, so the numbers 480-488 have 8 in the tens place. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. Therefore, total in the tens place is 4 ranges * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

    "text": " That's 48 intervals of 10, but actually, each interval contributes one 4 in the units place. So from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 484 is included, so maybe I was correct initially to take 484 divided by 10, which is 48.4, but since we're only considering the units digit, perhaps it's better to think of it as 48 full tens and then a partial. Wait, maybe another approach: from 1 to 488, how many times does the units digit cycle through 0-9? For each ten numbers, the units digit cycles once. So, the number of complete tens is 488 divided by 10, which is 48 complete sets, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each complete set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once more (484). So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 would be beyond 488? Wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 488 is beyond 449, so yes, 440-449 is within 488. So, how many sets of 100 are there? Let's see: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, in 1-99: 40-49, that's 10 numbers. Similarly, in 100-199: 140-149, 10 numbers. 200-299: 240-249, 10 numbers. 300-399: 340-349, 10 numbers. 400-488: 440-449, 10 numbers. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, in 400-488, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, 10 numbers. So total tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. So total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? The number of terms in the sequence 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The common difference is 10, so the nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. The last term is 488, so 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. Subtract 8: (n-1)*10 = 480. Divide by 10: n-1 = 48, so n = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. Alternatively, as before, from 1-488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (480 numbers) plus 8 extra (481-488). In each full set, 8 appears once in the units place, so 48 times, plus in the last 8 numbers, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so 1 more, totaling 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is included, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of the range. So, how many sets? Each hundred has one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 489 is beyond 488). So, in each hundred except the last, it's 10 numbers, and in the last hundred, it's 9 numbers. So total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 400-488 includes 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, yes, 9 times. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. So total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The last set contributes 9 occurrences, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " That's 48 intervals of 10, but the count is actually 49 because it includes both the start and end. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. The number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is given by ((last term - first term)/common difference) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. Let's count how many sets of ten there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, and so on. How many such sets are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first set, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. Let me calculate how many numbers that is. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me compute that: 49 + 50 = 99, and 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. Using the formula again: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be next, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that set. Let me count the sets: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 4\u00d710=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in sets like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Number of sets: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Each set contributes 10 numbers: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in sets like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Number of full sets: 4 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 40.\n   - Partial set: 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No numbers in the book have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " That's 48 numbers because (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, so that's 49 times. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. So, for the units place, from 1 to 488, the number of 4's is 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's a total of 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's correct, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? It's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is included, so how many? Let me calculate. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes 10 numbers. How many such ranges are there? From 80-89: 10 numbers. Then 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. That's 4 ranges, so 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, does 480-489 exist? Since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 is part of the hundreds place, but in the tens place, 8 in the tens place would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. Wait, so I think I made a mistake here. Let me correct that. The hundreds place is 4, so for the tens place, the 8 can be in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens place contributions are: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 4 ranges, but actually, there's a fifth range where 8 is in the tens place in the hundreds. So, total tens place 8's: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For the 4's: units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't overcount in the tens place for 8's. Wait, when I counted the tens place for 8's, I included 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. That's 10+10+10+10+9=49, which is correct. So, the total 8's are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to make an off-by-one error. Let me verify the units place for 4's and 8's again. For 4's in units place: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, 4 +10(n-1)=484 \u2192 10(n-1)=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 terms. Correct. For 8's in units place: 8,18,...,488. Similarly, 8 +10(n-1)=488 \u219210(n-1)=480 \u2192n-1=48 \u2192n=49. So, 49 terms. Correct. For tens place in 4's: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, and 5 ranges, so 50. Correct. For tens place in 8's:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 ranges, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place for 4's:400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. Hundreds place for 8's: none, since 800 is beyond 488. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. Total 8's:49+49=98. Difference:188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, each hundred has another 10 numbers. So, from 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so it's valid. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 times. Now, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many times. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within 488. Yes, up to 488. So, 480-488 is part of this. Each set from 80-89, 180-189, etc., has 10 numbers. How many such sets are there? From 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, so the last set is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, the first four sets contribute 4*10=40, and the last set contributes 9. So total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, no, because 480-488 is only 9 numbers, but in the tens place, it's 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers in the hundreds place with 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 times. Now, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places for 8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 times. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 188. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't overcount. Let me recount the units place for 4: from 4,14,...484. How many? (484-4)/10 +1=48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place for 4: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place for 4: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. For 8's: units place:49, same as 4. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set is only 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none.

From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number is 488, which is in the units place as 8. So, the count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the range. Let me check each range: - 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). - 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). - 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). - 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). - 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, for the first four ranges, each has 10 numbers, so 4*10 = 40. Plus the last range, 9 numbers, so total is 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This is 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This is 89 times.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This is 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as there are no pages 800-899. This is 0 times.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 40-49 up to 440-449. That's five ranges. So, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 numbers each = 50 occurrences. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488. The last range would be 440-449, which is within 488. So, all five ranges are valid. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Wait, but in the hundreds place, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check my math again. 49 + 50 is indeed 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range has 10 numbers. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 80-89 up to 380-389. That's four ranges. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 occurrences. Wait, but let me check if 480-489 is within the book. The book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the book. So, does 480-488 count as another range where the tens digit is 8? Yes, because 480-488 has the tens digit as 8. So, that's a fifth range. So, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), which is 9 numbers, not 10. Hmm, but in terms of the tens digit being 8, 480-489 would have 10 numbers, but since the book stops at 488, we only have 9 numbers. So, does that affect the count? Let me think. When considering the tens digit, for 480-489, the tens digit is 8, but since the book only goes up to 488, we have 480, 481, ..., 488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, the 8 appears 9 times in this last range. So, the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 occurrences, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. The fifth range is 480-488, which has 9 occurrences. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 50. So, I need to correct that. So, units place: 49, tens place: 49. Now, hundreds place: The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. So, total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. Difference is 90. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place for 4's. When counting the tens place for 4's, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50. That seems correct. For 8's in the tens place, I initially thought five ranges but realized that the last range only has 9 numbers, so it's 4 full ranges (40) plus 9, totaling 49. So, 49 in tens place. Units place for both 4 and 8 are 49 each. So, 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " That's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? Let me check. 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's valid. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488. So, how many numbers? The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is 488. The count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 numbers. Let's count the blocks: 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 blocks, so 4*10=40 times. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 would have 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, the 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, I need to add those 9 to the previous count. So, 4 blocks *10=40, plus 9=49 times in the tens place. Wait, no. Wait, 480-488 is part of the hundreds digit 4, but the tens digit is 8. So, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 5 blocks, but the last block only has 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's is 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's) =90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as the book ends at 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid. Let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each set of ten numbers (e.g., 40-49) has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. How many such sets are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one set. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 occurrences. 5 * 10 = 50. However, wait, in the last set, 440-449, the maximum page is 488, so 449 is within 488, so all 10 numbers are valid. So, 5 sets * 10 = 50. Therefore, 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This would be from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 89 numbers. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 occurrences of the digit 4. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 occurrences of 8 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in sets like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within the book's pages. The book ends at 488, so 480-488 is valid. So, how many sets are there? From 0-99: 80-89. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: 480-488. So that's 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 occurrences except possibly the last one. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page. So, 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, not 10. So, the first four sets each have 10 numbers, and the last set has 9. So, total occurrences in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 occurrences of the digit 8. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " That's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, the last block is only up to 488, so the tens digit 4 in 440-449 is still within 488, so that's fine. So, how many full blocks are there? From 0-99: one block, 100-199: another, 200-299: another, 300-399: another, and 400-488: partial. Wait, but in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is a full 10 numbers. So, total blocks with tens digit 4: 5 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but 400-488 is a partial block, but since 440-449 is within 488, it's still 10 numbers. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds digit is only 4 for 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many full blocks? From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189 is 10. 200-299: 280-289 is 10. 300-399: 380-389 is 10. 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9 =49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49 =98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98 =90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in any page number. There are 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " That's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, so maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of times 4 is in the ones digit. For each set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many such sets are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets and a partial set from 481 to 488. In each full set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial set from 481 to 488, we have 484, which is another 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on up to 440-449. How many such hundreds are there? The first is 40-49 (hundreds digit 0), then 140-149 (hundreds digit 1), 240-249 (hundreds digit 2), 340-349 (hundreds digit 3), and 440-449 (hundreds digit 4). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, total tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place, which would be from 400 to 488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that is. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences, except maybe the last one. Let's check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: here, the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 +1 = 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here. So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400 to 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last range contributes 9.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n- More 4's than 8's: \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " That's 484 - 4 divided by 10 plus 1. So (484 - 4)/10 = 480/10 = 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. Wait, but 440-449 would only go up to 449, which is less than 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 include 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 50 in total for the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4 for numbers 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is 488, so (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, how many blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, total is 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10=40 and 9, so total 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n- 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " That's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, so maybe I was wrong earlier. So, in the units place, 4 appears 49 times. Let me check that again. The number of terms in an arithmetic sequence can be found by ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. Here, first term is 4, last term is 484, common difference is 10. So, ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Yes, so 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's look at the tens place. The 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range. Let me count how many such groups there are. From 0-99: 40-49: that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149: another 10. From 200-299: 240-249: another 10. From 300-399: 340-349: another 10. From 400-488: 440-449: that's 10 numbers as well. So, that's 5 groups, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, the total number of 4's is the sum of the 4's in the units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me think again. Wait, in the hundreds place, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers, correct. But in the tens place, I had 5 groups, each contributing 10, so 50. Units place, 49. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Let me recount the units place. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That's 48. But then, the 48th group ends at 480, and then we have 481-488. In the 481-488 range, the next 4 in the units place would be 484. So, that's one more, making it 49. So, yes, 49 in the units place. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only up to 488, so the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, but how many numbers is that? From 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, in each hundred group, except the last one, it's 10 numbers. Let's see: From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189: 10. 200-299: 280-289:10. 300-399: 380-389:10. 400-488: 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 4 groups of 10 and one group of 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each group contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such groups.\n   - Total: 5 * 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four groups contribute 10 each, and the last group (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in the range 800-899 exist, so 0 times.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " That's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, so maybe I was wrong before. The correct count is 49. Let me check with a smaller example: from 1 to 24, the units digit 4 appears at 4,14,24. That's 3 times. Using the formula: (24 - 4)/10 + 1 = 20/10 +1 = 2+1=3. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, from 1 to 488, the number of 4's in the units place is 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on up to 440-449. Since 488 is less than 500, the last block is 440-449. How many blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, the tens digit 4 appears 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This happens from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the formula: (488 -8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This happens in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. How many such blocks are there? 80-89: yes, 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, for the tens place, we have 4 blocks of 10, contributing 4*10=40, plus the partial block from 480-488, which has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So total in tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This would be from 800 to 899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that's 90. But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For the 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I counted the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers. Let me check that. From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 488-480+1=9 numbers. Yes, correct. So, 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10, so 4*10=40. Then 480-488 adds 9, so total 49 in the tens place. That seems right. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " That's 484 - 4 divided by 10 plus 1. So (484 - 4)/10 = 48, plus 1 is 49. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. So, in the units place, the number of 4's is 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? From 40-49 (1 block), 140-149 (second block), up to 440-449 (fifth block). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is part of the three-digit numbers, so I need to make sure that 440-449 doesn't exceed 488. Since 449 is less than 488, that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units: 4,14,...,484: as I thought, 484 is the last one. So, the number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. That's correct. Tens place: from 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 89. So total 4's: 49 +50 +89= 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many? The last number is 488, so (488 -8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block is 10 numbers. Let's see how many blocks there are. 80-89 is the first, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. But wait, does 480-489 have 480-488? That's only 9 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, the last block would be 380-389. Wait, 480-488 is part of the hundreds place, but 480-488 is in the hundreds place as 4, but the tens digit is 8. So, 480-488 has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, does that mean an extra 9? Wait, no, because 480-488 is part of the hundreds place, but the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 5 blocks, but the last one has only 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (40) plus 9, totaling 49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 4 blocks, but actually, 480-488 is another block where the tens digit is 8, but only 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)= 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. Let me recount. Tens place for 8's: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, total 98. So, 4's:188, 8's:98, difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " That's 48 intervals of 10, so 49 numbers. Hmm, maybe I should calculate it differently. The number of terms in the sequence from 4 to 484 with a common difference of 10 is given by ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5*10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each of these numbers has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in numbers ending with 8, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first is 8, and the last is 488. How many such numbers? Using the same method as before: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers. Let's count how many such ranges: From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: There's no 480-489 because the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8, so from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 480-488. So, that's 9 numbers. So, the tens place in the hundreds would be 9 instead of 10. So, let's adjust. So, from 0-399, we have 4 ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit 4 appears in the 40-49 range, which is 10 numbers, and then every hundred after that. Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So 5 * 10 = 50 times in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 count fully? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds digit. So that's 89 times. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, looking at units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last range is 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which contributes 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Let's calculate: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 onwards, but the book only goes up to 488. So there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yes, that seems correct.

    "text": " That's 48 numbers because 484 is the 49th term, but wait, 4 is the first, so from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. So, the correct count for units place 4's is 49. Let me verify: For each set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48. But wait, the last set is from 480 to 488, which includes 484 as the 49th occurrence. So actually, it's 49 times. Yeah, I think 49 is correct. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10. Then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484: that's 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each with 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many are there? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 numbers. Let's see: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10. Now, 480-489 would be the next block, but since the book only goes up to 488, the 480-488 range is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, we have 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial block of 9 numbers (480-488). So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So total is 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a big difference. Let me check the tens place for 4's again. From 40-49: 10 numbers, each with a 4 in tens place. Then 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, so 5*10=50. That seems right. And hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. That's correct because 488-400+1=89. For 8's, units place: 8,18,...,488: that's 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, total 98. So, 188-98=90. I think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   \n   Total '4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of '8's:**\n   - **Units place:** The digit '8' appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, and 380-389. Each block contributes 10 numbers, except the last partial block 480-488, which contributes 9. Total = 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers where '8' appears in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   \n   Total '8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's - Number of '8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 times more than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " That's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many full hundreds we have. From 1-488, we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. Wait, but the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many such ranges are there? Let me count: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. Each number here has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such ranges are there? From 1-488, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 89. So, there are 89 eights in total. Finally, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 89 = 99. So, there are 99 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " That's 484 divided by 10 plus 1? Wait, no. Let me think again. The number of terms in the sequence from 4 to 484 with a common difference of 10 is given by ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, the last range is 440-449, and since the book only goes up to 488, 449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within the book's pages. The book ends at 488, so 480-488 is valid. So, that's another range: 480-488. Wait, but in the tens place, it's 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributing 10 numbers. Let me count how many such ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: Hmm, here the tens digit is 8, but the units go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8, so each of these 9 numbers has an 8 in the tens place. So, how many ranges? Let me see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but earlier I thought each range contributes 10, but the last one only contributes 9 because the book ends at 488. So, total 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place: 4,14,...,484: 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). Wait, 5 ranges, each 10 numbers: 5*10=50. So that's correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 488-400+1=89. So 89. Total 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds place: 0. So total 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each range contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488.

For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block would be 440-449, since 450-488 doesn't include 4 in the tens place beyond 449. Let's count how many full blocks there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine.

So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's printed.

Now, 480-488: that's 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place is 4 blocks of 10 (40) plus 9, which is 49 times.

So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's printed. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449. Let me calculate how many such sets there are. The first set is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. Let's see, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me see how many such sets there are. The first set is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40 times. Wait, does 480-489 count? Well, 488 is the last page, so 480-488 would be part of that range. So, does that add another set? Let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, but wait, 480 has an 8 in the tens place, 481, etc., up to 488. So, how many 8's in the tens place here? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, that's an additional 9 8's in the tens place. Wait, but I thought each set was 10 numbers, but in this case, it's only 9 because 489 isn't included. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488. So, 4*10 +9=49. Wait, that seems off because earlier I thought it was 4 sets, but now adding 9 more. Wait, let me recount. The first set is 80-89: 10 numbers. Then 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, 40 8's. Then, 480-488: 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total 40 +9=49 8's in the tens place. Hmm, that seems correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, when I counted the tens place for 4's, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. That's correct.\n\nFor the 4's in the units place, I had 49 numbers, which seems correct because 488/10=48.8, so 49 times.\n\nFor the hundreds place, 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 4's. That adds up to 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor the 8's, units place: 49, correct. Tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. So total 49+49=98 8's.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. There are 49 occurrences.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " That's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, so maybe my initial thought was wrong. Let me correct that. So, for the units place, there are 49 occurrences of 4. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through each digit position again: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. To count how many: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let's check each block: - 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). - 100-199: 180-189 (10). - 200-299: 280-289 (10). - 300-399: 380-389 (10). - 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers). So, the first four blocks each have 10, and the last block has 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " That's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, so maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is actually (488 // 10) + 1 if the last number is a multiple of 10. But 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But since 488 ends with 8, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So that's 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 fit within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. Each of these numbers has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me count how many times this happens. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me count these ranges. From 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10, because 488 is the last page. So, that's 4 full ranges (each with 10) and one partial range with 9. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times. Now, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

So, for units place, 4's appear 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but does the last block go up to 449? Yes, because 440-449 is within 488. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many times. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. Using the formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count the blocks. From 0-99: 80-89 is one block. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers, not 10. So, the first four blocks are 10 numbers each, and the last block is 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check that again. From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189: 10. 200-299: 280-289: 10. 300-399: 380-389: 10. 400-488: 480-488: 9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo find this, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n1. **Units place:** The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. From 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. But wait, 440-449 would be in the hundreds place as well, but since we're only considering the tens place here, each of these contributes 10 occurrences. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds digit, so that's 89 occurrences. But wait, let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, the last occurrence would be at 488. Let's see: from 8 to 488, how many numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389:10. And 480-488: that's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, total in the tens place is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9 (since 488 is the last page). So, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the hundreds digit is 8. But our book goes up to 488, so the hundreds digits go from 1 to 4. Wait, 488 is in the 400s, so the hundreds digit is 4. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I feel like maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check that again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 488 is the last page. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. Wait, but let me think again: is there any overlap in the counting? For example, when counting 440-449, I counted both the hundreds and tens place, but each digit is counted separately, so that's okay. Similarly, for 8's, 480-488 is counted in the tens place, and the hundreds place for 480-488 is 4, not 8, so that's fine. I think my counting is accurate. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place \u2192 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count these: - For 40-49: that's 10 numbers. - For 140-149: another 10. - Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 occurrences. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so does 440-449 go beyond that? 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). However, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4. So, that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many terms? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. So, that's 4 sets of 10, totaling 40 occurrences. Wait, does 480-489 fall within 488? 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, only 480-488 are included. So, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, the 8's would be in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, so I need to adjust that. So, for the tens place: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 40, but now it's 49. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me clarify: The tens digit is 8 in numbers where the tens place is 8. So, for two-digit numbers: 80-89: 10. For three-digit numbers: 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-489: but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 +9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but wait, the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=49+50=99+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct. For the tens place of 4's, I had 50, which comes from 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, 10 each, so 50. Correct. Units place for 4's: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, step 10. Number of terms: (484-4)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. For 8's: units=49, same as 4's. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, total 8's=49+49=98. So, difference=188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 4 sets of 10 and 9 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " That's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, so maybe I was wrong before. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place, the 4 can appear in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, for each hundred, there's one range where the tens digit is 4. So, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me check the last occurrence. 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, how many such numbers? Starting from 8, every 10 numbers. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let me check how many ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 ranges. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 numbers, but the last one, 480-488, contributes 9 numbers because 489 is beyond 488. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's are units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, the difference is 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount the 4's. Units place: 4,14,...484. That's 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, 5 ranges, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units place: 8,18,...488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1=49. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four ranges is 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.
