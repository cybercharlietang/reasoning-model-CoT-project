    "text": " I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can check a smaller range to see if my counting method works. Let's say a 20-page book. How many 4's and 8's? Page numbers 1-20. 4's: 4,14: two 4's. 8's:8,18: two 8's. So, 2-2=0. Now, using my method: Units place: 4,14: 2. Tens place: 40-49 isn't in 20, so 0. Hundreds:0. Total 4's:2. Units place for 8:8,18:2. Tens place:80-89 not in 20, so 0. Total 8's:2. So, difference is 0. Correct. Another test: 50 pages. 4's: units:4,14,24,34,44:5. Tens:40-49:10. Total 4's:15. 8's: units:8,18,28,38,48:5. Tens:40-49 no, but 80-89 is beyond 50, so 0. Total 8's:5. So, 15-5=10 more 4's. Let me count manually: 4,14,24,34,44 (5), and 40-49 (10 more 4's). 8's:8,18,28,38,48 (5). So, 15-5=10. Correct. So, my method works. Therefore, in 488 pages, the difference is 90.

    "text": " I think that's correct. But let me check another way. Maybe by considering the number of digits in each position. Alternatively, I can think of each digit place separately and calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each. For units place: For 488 pages, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each cycle of 10, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, in 488 numbers, how many complete cycles of 10 are there? 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 complete cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, units place: 48 fours and 48 eights. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the 488th page is included. So, after 48 cycles (480 numbers), we have 8 more numbers: 481-488. In these, the units digits are 1-8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once more (at 484), and 8 appears once more (at 488). So, units place: 49 fours and 49 eights. That matches what I had before. Similarly, for the tens place: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (like 40-49) and 10 where it's 8 (80-89). So, in 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 488 /100 =4.88, so 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 fours and 40 eights. Now, the remaining 88 pages (401-488). In the tens place, 401-488: the tens digits go from 0-8. So, looking for 4 and 8 in the tens place. - 401-409: tens digit is 0, so no fours or eights. - 410-419: tens digit is 1, no. - 420-429: tens digit 2, no. - 430-439: tens digit 3, no. - 440-449: tens digit 4, so 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is fully included. So, that's 10 fours. - 450-459: tens digit 5, no. - 460-469: tens digit 6, no. - 470-479: tens digit 7, no. - 480-488: tens digit 8, so numbers 480-488. That's 9 numbers. So, in the remaining 88 pages, tens place has 10 fours and 9 eights. So, total tens place: fours=40+10=50, eights=40+9=49. Which matches what I had before. For hundreds place: For numbers 1-99, hundreds digit is 0, so no fours or eights. For 100-199, hundreds digit is 1, so no. 200-299: hundreds digit 2, no. 300-399: hundreds digit 3, no. 400-488: hundreds digit 4, so 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 fours in hundreds place. For eights in hundreds place: none, since 800+ is beyond 488. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) =188. Eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. So, 188-98=90. Yep, that seems consistent. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens digit in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block of 100 contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds digit for pages 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens digit in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block of 100 contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block which has 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No 8's appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
