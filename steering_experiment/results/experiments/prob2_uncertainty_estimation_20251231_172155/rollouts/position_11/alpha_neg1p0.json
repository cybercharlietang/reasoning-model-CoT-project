    "text": " To find how many such numbers there are, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48 full groups of 10, and then the remainder is 8. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 times. But wait, does 488 include another 4 in the units place? Let me check: the last number with 4 in the units place before 488 is 484. So, yes, that's 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's a total of 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. Each of these numbers has 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, there are 187 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so there are 48 full groups, each contributing an 8 in the units place. But wait, does 488 itself have an 8 in the units place? Yes, so that's 49 times. Wait, no, because 488 is the last number, so it's included. So, the units place 8's are from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, the count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many full ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is one range (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 is another (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, how many numbers are in 480-488? That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens place 8's are: 4 full ranges (each 10) and one partial range of 9. So, total is 4*10 +9=40+9=49. So, tens place: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - Number of 4's: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups).\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   - Number of ranges: 5 (each contributing 10 numbers).  \n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488.  \n   - Number of pages: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - Number of 8's: 49 (since (488 - 8) \u00f7 10 + 1 = 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.  \n   - Full ranges: 4 (each contributing 10 numbers).  \n   - Partial range: 480-488 (9 numbers).  \n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's (pages go up to 488).  \n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the last number with 4 in the units place is 484. To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can calculate how many sets of 10 there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 484 fall within 488? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, that would be 48 times. But wait, 488 is page 488, so does the last page have a 4 in the units place? No, it's 488, which ends with an 8. So, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is indeed the 48th occurrence. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. The 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in 1-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). In 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). In 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). In 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). In 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, how many ranges is that? Let's count: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 400-488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total number of 4's is 187. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place for numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first 8 is at 8, and the last one within 488 is 488 itself. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? Let's see, the first is 8, which is the 8th number, and the last is 488, which is the 488th number. The count would be the number of times 8 appears in the units place, which is every 10 numbers. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, but since 488 is included, we have 49 instances. Wait, no. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is the number of complete decades (sets of 10) plus one if the last number is in the 8's place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8. Then, the last partial decade is 480-488, which includes 488, so that's another 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, 488 is the 9th number in that decade. So, the units digit 8 occurs once in each decade, so 48 complete decades (1-480) give 48 8's, and then 488 is the 49th. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. This occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is the range. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last page). So, how many ranges? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 ranges. The first four contribute 10 each, and the last one contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 48 times (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 50 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 89 times (e.g., 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 49 times (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 49 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 0 times.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **89**.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{89}."

But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, the last group is 480-488, which includes 488, but 488 is beyond 484, so the last 4 in the units place is 484. So, that's 48 times. Hmm, but wait, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Let me think differently. The first number ending with 4 is 4, then every 10 numbers after that. So, the count would be floor(488 / 10) = 48. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor of that is 48, which means there are 48 numbers ending with 4. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, total 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the counts from units, tens, and hundreds places: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187. So, total 4's printed are 187. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so 488 is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, 488 is the last one. So, from 8, 18, ..., 488, that's 48 +1 = 49? Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me think again. The first 8 is 8, then every 10 numbers. So, the number of 8's in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49. Wait, no. Because 488 is 488, which is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. Wait, let me check: 8 is 1st, 18 is 2nd, ..., 488 is the 49th. Because 488 = 8 + 10*(n-1). So, 488 -8 = 10*(n-1) \u2192 480 =10*(n-1) \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. That would be 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many blocks? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total for tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the counts: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (4's) -98 (8's)=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " To find how many such numbers there are, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, the last group would be 480-488, where 484 is included. So, that's 48 times. But wait, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see: the first occurrence is at 4, then every 10 pages. So, 4,14,24,...,484. To calculate how many terms there are, I can consider the number of terms in the sequence starting at 4, with a common difference of 10, up to 484. The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d. Here, a_1=4, d=10, a_n=484. So, 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10 => 480 = (n-1)*10 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, that seems a bit off because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but the number of 4's in the units place should be 49 because 484 is the last one, which is the 49th term. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then 14, 24,..., 484. So, the number of such numbers is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one range, contributing 10 4's. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is another 10, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400 to 488. So, every page from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, but let's see. The numbers ending with 8 are 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, starting at 8, each 10 numbers. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Wait, but 488 is included. Let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 more than 480. So, yes, 49 terms. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-489, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, in the hundreds place for 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have 4 full ranges (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Plus the partial range in 400-488, which is 9. So, total in the tens place: 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " How many such numbers are there? Well, from 4 to 484, the number of terms is calculated by dividing 484 by 10, which gives 48.4, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but wait, 484 is the last term, so 484 is 48*10 + 4, so actually, the number of terms is 48 + 1? Wait, no, because from 4 to 484, it's every 10 numbers starting at 4. So, the count would be ((484 - 4)/10) + 1. Let me compute that: (484 - 4) = 480, 480/10 = 48, so 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count these. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place. So, from 1-99: 40-49, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 400-488. So, that's 5 blocks of 10, so 5*10 = 50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, that's 89 times. Wait, but wait, actually, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, but the hundreds digit is 4 in all of them, so that's 89 occurrences. So, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many terms that is. The last term is 488, so starting from 8, each 10 numbers. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, so let me check each block. From 1-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so that's 9 numbers. So, the tens place has 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but let me verify: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488, so the hundreds digit is only 4, never 8. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place in any page number up to 488. So, 0 times. So, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear. 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " To find how many such numbers there are, I can calculate how many complete sets of 10 are there up to 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the last set would be 484, which is the 48th set because 48*10 = 480, and then 484 is the 4th in the 48th set. So, actually, there are 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of times 4 is the ones digit. The first occurrence is at 4, then every 10 numbers. So, how many such numbers are there? It's the floor of (488 / 10) which is 48, but since 488 is 48*10 + 8, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is 48*10 + 4. So, yes, 48 times. But wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. The first range is 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? Let me check: 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, how many such ranges? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10 = 50 times. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 1-100: 40-49, which is 10 numbers. From 101-200: 140-149, another 10. From 201-300: 240-249, another 10. From 301-400: 340-349, another 10. From 401-500: 440-449, but since the book only goes up to 488, does 440-449 fit? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 50 times. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. This occurs in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Wait, but I'm counting the digit 4, so in each of these 89 numbers, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8. So, 48 times. But wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 is included, so the last occurrence is 488. So, 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-100: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. From 101-200: 180-189, another 10. From 201-300: 280-289, another 10. From 301-400: 380-389, another 10. From 401-488: 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the first four ranges contribute 4*10 = 40, and the last range contributes 9. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. Then 480-488: that's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units: 48, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 48+49=97.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's:187, total 8's:97. So, 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4 and 8.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 (from 4,14,...,484)\n- Tens:50 (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449)\n- Hundreds:89 (400-488)\nTotal:48+50+89=187\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units:48 (8,18,...,488)\n- Tens:49 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488)\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:48+49=97\n\nSo, 187-97=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check the tens place again. The ranges are:\n\n80-89:10 numbers\n180-189:10\n280-289:10\n380-389:10\n480-488:9\n\nSo, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, the ranges are:\n\n40-49:10\n140-149:10\n240-249:10\n340-349:10\n440-449:10\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers, right? So, that's 5 ranges, each 10, so 50. That's correct.\n\nAnd for the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nSo, 187-97=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any edge cases. For example, when counting units digits, does 488 count as having an 8 in the units place? Yes, it does, so that's included in the 48 counts. Similarly, in the tens place, 488 is included in the 480-488 range, contributing to the 8's count.\n\nAnother thing to check: when counting 4's in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but 400 to 488 inclusive is 89 numbers because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are accurate. Therefore, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 97, so the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484 \u2192 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488 \u2192 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 4 ranges \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in 1-488 \u2192 0 occurrences.\nTotal 8's: 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " To find how many such numbers there are, I can calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. From 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete sets of 10 in 488, which is 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8), and then check if there's a partial set beyond that. But wait, 488 is the last number, so the last set would be 480-488, which includes 484 as the last 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 times. Wait, actually, each set of 10 has exactly one 4 in the units place, except maybe the last set if it doesn't reach the next multiple. But since 488 is exactly 48 sets of 10 (since 48*10=480), plus 8 more numbers. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 fours in the units place, and from 481 to 488, the units place 4 is at 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 +1 = 49? Wait, no, because from 1 to 480, it's 48 fours, and then 484 is the 49th. So, units place 4's: 49. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as (488 + 1) / 10 = 48.9, which we take the integer part, so 48, but then check if 488 is beyond 480. Alternatively, maybe it's better to calculate as (488 // 10) + 1 if the last number is beyond the last multiple. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? They are 4,14,24,...,484. The first term is 4, the last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10 => 480 = (n-1)*10 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 times. So, units place 4's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. Let's see how many such blocks there are. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. How many hundreds are there? From 1-400, there are 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, tens place 4's: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nNow, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +50 +89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 4's.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nSimilarly, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8's in the units place are 8,18,28,..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10 => 480 = (n-1)*10 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 times. So, units place 8's:49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488? From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the next block would be 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place would be 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, so that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, tens place 8's:40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but wait: in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so numbers are 480,481,...,488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's correct. So, tens place 8's:49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's:0.\n\nTherefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's:188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 occurrences. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. So, starting from 400, each number up to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. To find how many numbers that is, I can subtract 400 from 488 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding them all up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 gives 187. So, there are 187 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's divide 488 by 10, which gives 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, 488 is included, so the last number with an 8 in the units place is 488, which is exactly the last page. So, how many numbers is that? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The formula is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, earlier I thought it was 48, but now I'm getting 49. Let me check: starting at 8, the next is 18, 28,..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's see: each of these ranges has 10 numbers, except the last one which has 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many sets? From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 occurrences. Wait, but let me check if 480-488 is correct. The last page is 488, so yes, that's correct. So, 49 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For the fours: units:48, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 187. For the eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. 187 -98=89. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check the units place for 8 again. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The numbers are 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. That's correct. Similarly, for the tens place, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, total eights:98. Fours:187. Difference:89. So, the answer is 89 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 48 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " To find how many such numbers there are, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, there are 48 full groups, each giving one 4, and then an extra 4 in 484. Wait, no, 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, so that's 48 + 1 = 49 times? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many times does the units digit 4 appear? It's the same as the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra in the last incomplete group. The number of complete decades is 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete). Each complete decade contributes one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 times. Now, in the last incomplete decade, from 480 to 488, the units digits go from 0 to 8. So the units digit 4 appears once here, at 484. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This occurs from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, similar to the 4's, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is the number of complete decades plus any extra in the last incomplete decade. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8. Then, in the last incomplete decade (480-488), the units digit 8 appears at 488. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This occurs in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last range. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except maybe the last one if it's incomplete. Let's check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times. - 180-189: 10 times. - 280-289: 10 times. - 380-389: 10 times. - 480-488: This is from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in all these numbers, so that's 9 times. So total tens place 8's: 4 ranges with 10 each and one with 9. So 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This would occur from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Checking 4's: Units place: 48 full decades (1-480) give 48, and then 484 is the 49th. Tens place: 5 ranges (40-49, 140-149, etc.), each 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. 48 + 50 + 89 = 187? Wait, 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. Wait, earlier I thought it was 188. Hmm, maybe I miscalculated. Wait, let's recount. Units place: From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus the last group which has 484, so one more, total 49. Tens place: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 ranges, each 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Yes, that's correct. Now for 8's: Units place: 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus 488, so 49. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total 8's:49+49=98. So 188-98=90. So the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding how many more 4's are printed than 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences (48 full decades + 1 in the last incomplete decade).\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences (48 full decades + 1 in the last incomplete decade).\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 times more than the digit 8.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 4 to 484, each set of 10 numbers contributes one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place would be the number of times 4 appears in this way. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, the last set goes up to 488, so 484 is the last one, which is the 48th set. So, that's 48 times. But wait, when I think about it, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so the number of 4's in the units place is indeed floor(488/10) = 48. Wait, but let me check: 488/10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4 for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on up to 440-449. How many blocks are there? Well, starting from 40, each hundred has one such block. So, 40-49 (in the 0-99 range), 140-149 (100-199), 240-249 (200-299), 340-349 (300-399), and 440-449 (400-488). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, 440-449: 10. So, 5\u00d710=50. So, 50 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so the last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? The first 8 is at 8, then every 10 numbers after that. So, the number of 8's in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48, but wait, 48\u00d710=480, so the last 8 in the units place is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. Let me see: 8, 18, 28,..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, actually, there are 49 8's in the units place. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. So, the correct count is 49. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers. Then 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. Now, does 480-489 fall within 488? 480-489 is up to 489, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the block. But wait, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since our book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but in terms of the tens place, 480-489 would have 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so it's 9 numbers. Hmm, but when considering the tens digit, each block is 100 numbers, so 80-89 is in the first hundred, 180-189 in the second, etc. So, how many full blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89: yes, 10 numbers. 180-189: yes, 10. 280-289: yes, 10. 380-389: yes, 10. 480-489: but we only go up to 488, so it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have 4 full blocks (each contributing 10) and one partial block contributing 9. So, total is 4\u00d710 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 times the digit 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98. Wait, no, let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds:0, so total 98. Now, the number of 4's was 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 -98=89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the number of 4's and 8's again. Starting with 4's: Units place: From 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 484=4 +10(n-1). 484-4=480=10(n-1), so n-1=48, so n=49. Wait, so units place has 49 4's, not 48. I think I made a mistake earlier. So, units place for 4's: 4,14,...,484. So, number of terms is (484-4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place:49. Tens place:40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5\u00d710=50. Hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. Wait, earlier I thought it was 187, but now it's 188. Hmm, let me check: 49 (units) +50 (tens)=99, plus 89 (hundreds)=188. So, total 4's:188. Now for 8's: Units place:8,18,...,488. Number of terms: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units:49. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, but the last block (480-488) has 9 numbers. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place:49. Hundreds place:0. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, now I'm getting 90. Earlier I thought 89, but now 90. Let me check again. 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the correct difference is 90. I must have made a mistake earlier in counting the units place for 4's as 48 instead of 49. So, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10. The number of terms is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of terms} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488 - 4}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each block of 100 contributes 10 such numbers, and there are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Thus:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of terms} = 5 \\times 10 = 50\n   \\]\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal number of 4's:\n\\[\n49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

Each block of 100 contributes 10 such numbers, except the last block (480-488), which contributes 9. Thus:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of terms} = 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\n   \\]\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal number of 8's:\n\\[\n49 + 49 = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference:**\n\\[\n188 - 98 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

Here, the common difference is 10. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, 440-449 is included, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 4's. Let me calculate each set. - 40-49: There are 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. So, 10 times. - 140-149: Similarly, another 10 times. - 240-249: Another 10 times. - 340-349: Another 10 times. - 440-449: Another 10 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 times, so 5*10=50 times. However, wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check again. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then, 140-149: 10. 240-249:10. 340-349:10. 440-449:10. So that's 5 sets, 10 each, totaling 50. But wait, 440-449 is up to 449, which is less than 488, so it's included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 starting from 400 up to 488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. Let's see: starting at 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? The first term is 8, last term is 488. The common difference is 10. So, n = ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is included. So, let's count each set. - 80-89: 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, 10 times. - 180-189: 10 times. - 280-289: 10 times. - 380-389: 10 times. - 480-488: Hmm, this is a partial set because it goes up to 488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 times. So total in the tens place is 10+10+10+10+9=49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For the 4's: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For the 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers from 1 to 488. \n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 4 to 484, that's 484/10 = 48.4, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last one ending with 4 in the units place. Let me check: starting from 4, each step of 10. So, the count is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Hmm, so 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within range, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. So, how many sets of 100 do we have? From 0-488, there are 5 sets: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. In each of these sets, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many complete sets? From 0-488, the 40-49 set is in the first set, then 140-149 in the second, 240-249 in the third, 340-349 in the fourth, and 440-449 in the fifth. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. Wait, but I think I should check if 400 is included. Yes, 400 is page number 400, so that's included. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but wait, let me check again because 400-488 is 89 numbers, but in the hundreds place, each of those 89 numbers contributes one 4. So, yes, 89. Then, units and tens add up to 49 + 50 = 99. So total 4's: 99 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? Starting from 8, each step of 10. The last one would be 488, since 488 is the last page. So, the count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many complete sets? Let's see: 80-89 is in 0-99, 180-189 in 100-199, 280-289 in 200-299, 380-389 in 300-399, and 480-488 in 400-488. So, that's 5 sets. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, but the last set (480-488) has only 9 numbers because 489 is beyond 488. Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the first four sets have 10 each, and the last set has 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 to 899, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, the hundreds place never has an 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the 4's. Units place: 4,14,...,484. So, from 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. That's correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89. So, total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, first four sets have 10 each, last set has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digits 4 appears in the units place for every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). \n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each set (40-49, 140-149, etc.) contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such sets (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - Total: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place for every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - The first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 numbers, and the last set (480-488) contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Total: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the number of terms in this sequence can be found by dividing 488 by 10 and taking the integer part. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page. The last 4 in the units place is 484, which is within 488, so we have 48 instances of 4 in the units place. Wait, actually, let me check: starting from 4, every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last term - first term)/step) + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Oh, right, I should have added 1 because both endpoints are included. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 440-449. Let's count how many full sets of 100 there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one set, so 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another set, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, 10 more. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449 is another set, 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is fully included. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, it's included. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have a 4. So, from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers. So, 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is included, so let's see how many terms. The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms can be calculated as ((488 - 8)/10) + 1. (480/10) +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is included, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, let's see: From 1-99: 80-89 is one set, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, in the hundreds place, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total 10+10+10+10+9=49 times 8 appears in the tens place. Wait, but wait: when we count the tens place, each set contributes 10 numbers, except the last one which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, so 4\u00d710 +9=49. So, 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 8 only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: \\( \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such sets.\n   - Total: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: \\( \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9.\n   - Total: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n- More 4's than 8's: \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place would be the number of such blocks. The last block would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the last 4 in the units place is 484. So, how many blocks? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but wait, 48 blocks would give us up to 480. Then from 481 to 488, there's another 4 in 484. So, actually, it's 49 times. Let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488/10 is 48.8, the integer part is 48, but since 48*10 = 480, and 480 + 4 = 484 is still within 488, so it's 49 times. Wait, no, that's not right. Because from 1 to 488, the number of numbers ending with 4 is equal to the number of complete decades plus one if the last number is beyond the last multiple of 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4, and then in the 49th decade (480-489), 484 is within 480-488, so that's one more 4. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449, and then maybe 480-489. Wait, but 480-489 is part of the 400-499 range, but the book only goes up to 488, so the 480-488 is part of that. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's think. Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, ..., 401-500) has a set of numbers where the tens digit is 4. Specifically, each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, etc. But since the book goes up to 488, in the 400-499 block, we only go up to 488, so the tens digit 4 would be from 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. Wait, no, the tens digit is the second digit from the right. So, in 400-409, the tens digit is 0, right? Wait, no, 400 is 4 0 0, so the tens digit is 0. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me correct that. The tens digit is the second digit. So, for example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4. In 140-149, it's 4, and so on. So, in each hundred block, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 would be in the 400-499 block, but since the book goes up to 488, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: from 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 201-300: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 301-400: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 401-500: 440-449 (10 numbers). But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, each hundred block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. How many hundred blocks are there? From 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488. Wait, 401-488 is part of the 400-499 block, but only up to 488. So, how many times does the tens digit 4 occur in 401-488? Let's see: 440-449 is entirely within 488, so that's 10 numbers. Then, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, so 480-488 would have tens digits 8, not 4. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in each of the first four hundred blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), there are 10 numbers each with tens digit 4. Then, in 401-488, it's another 10 from 440-449. So, total tens place 4's: 5 blocks * 10 = 50. Wait, but let me check: 1-100: 40-49: 10 numbers. 101-200:140-149:10. 201-300:240-249:10. 301-400:340-349:10. 401-488:440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? Well, from 1 to 488, the number of 8's in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades plus one if the last number is beyond the last multiple of 10. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8, and then in the 49th decade (480-489), 488 is within that, so that's one more 8. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. Wait, but in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, right? So, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: from 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 201-300: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 301-400: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 401-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 = 8, so 8+1=9 numbers. So, in the 401-488 block, the tens digit 8 occurs in 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49. Wait, but let me check: 1-100:80-89:10. 101-200:180-189:10. 201-300:280-289:10. 301-400:380-389:10. 401-488:480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 such occurrences (48 complete decades plus 484).\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 50 occurrences (10 per each of the first five hundred blocks).\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 such occurrences (48 complete decades plus 488).\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. There are 49 occurrences (10 per each of the first four hundred blocks plus 9 in 480-488).\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " To find how many such numbers there are, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, there are 49 numbers where the units digit is 4 because the last one would be 484, which is the 48th group plus one more. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then 14, 24, ..., up to 484. The number of terms in this sequence can be calculated by (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these decades contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many full decades there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in each hundred, there's a decade where the tens digit is 4. There are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, how many full decades with tens digit 4 are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). 100-199: 140-149 (10). 200-299: 240-249 (10). 300-399: 340-349 (10). 400-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is included. Let me calculate how many terms. The last term is 488, which is 488. So, starting from 8, each step is 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me see how many full decades there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). Now, 400-488: the next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place, 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have 4 full decades (each contributing 10) and one partial decade contributing 9. So, total is 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 times 8 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

There are 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can calculate how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the last set is 480-488, so 484 is the last number with a 4 in the units place. So, actually, it's 48 times. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 480 is the 48th set, the 484 is within that set, so yes, 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, so yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one set, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another set, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is another 10, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, how many sets is that? Let's see: 0-99: 1 set, 100-199: 1 set, 200-299: 1 set, 300-399: 1 set, 400-488: 1 set. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So 5 x 10 = 50 times. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400 to 488. Each of these numbers has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times. So, adding up all the 4's: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing an 8 in the units place. The last number would be 488, which is included. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place would be in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is within the book's pages. Let's count how many sets: 0-99: 80-89 is one set, 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189, another set. 200-299: 280-289, another. 300-399: 380-389, another. 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the first four sets each contribute 10 numbers, and the last set contributes 9. So, total in tens place: (4 x 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up all the 8's: units place (48) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, the digit 8 appears 97 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units 48, tens 49, hundreds 0. 48+49=97. 187-97=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the tens place for 8 again. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers, right? So, 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, etc.) plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49. That seems right. And for 4's, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, yes, 89. So, 187-97=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, how many such numbers are there? From 4 to 484, that's every 10 numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of times 4 appears in this sequence. Let me calculate: The first occurrence is at 4, and the last is at 484. To find how many terms there are, I can use the formula: ((Last - First) / Step) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. Wait, but wait a second. 488 is the last page, so 484 is indeed the last 4 in the units place. So, 49 seems correct. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's look at the tens place. The 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449, because 450-488 wouldn't include another 4 in the tens place until 490, which is beyond 488. So, how many sets of ten are there where the tens digit is 4? Let's see: 40-49: that's one set, 140-149: another, 240-249: another, 340-349: another, and 440-449: another. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. But wait, each set contributes 10 numbers, but the tens digit is 4 for each of those 10 numbers, so each set contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. But wait, let me check the last set: 440-449. The last number is 449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. So, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position separately. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let's check each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10, so another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: here, the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, in the tens place, each of these sets contributes 10, except the last one, which contributes 9. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 from the last set, totaling 49. Wait, but let me think again. Each set from 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 380-389, each contributes 10 8's in the tens place. The last set is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's recount the 4's: - Units place: 49. That seems right because from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers, so 49 times. - Tens place: 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 4's, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct. - Hundreds place: From 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. Now, the 8's: - Units place: 49, same as 4's because from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers. - Tens place: 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, so 4\u00d710=40, plus the last set 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 40+9=49. - Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 4's in units place: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 numbers, so 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four sets contribute 10 each: 4\u00d710 = 40.\n   - Last set (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " To find how many times this happens, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, there are 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490). Wait, but 488 is less than 490, so the last group would be 481-488, which includes 488. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48. But wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10, so the number of 4's is floor(488/10) = 48. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in groups of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these groups has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such groups there are. From 1-488, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). So, for the tens digit being 4, we have the groups: 40-49 (in the 0-99 range), 140-149 (100-199), 240-249 (200-299), 340-349 (300-399), and 440-449 (400-488). Each of these groups contributes 10 4's in the tens place. However, the last group, 440-449, is within 488, so it's valid. So, that's 5 groups, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10 = 50. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. The total numbers here are 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times does this happen? From 1 to 488, the number of 8's in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48. But wait, 488 is the last number, which ends with 8, so actually, it's exactly 48 times because 488 is included. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in groups like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these groups contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's see how many such groups there are. From 1-488, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). So, for the tens digit being 8, we have the groups: 80-89 (in 1-99), 180-189 (100-199), 280-289 (200-299), 380-389 (300-399). The next group would be 480-489, but since our book ends at 488, this group is only up to 488. So, does 480-488 count? Yes, because the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, but we have to check how many numbers are there. From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, in this group, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers. Therefore, the number of 8's in the tens place is 4 full groups (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 8's, and the partial group 480-488 contributing 9 8's. So, total is 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, 97 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484)\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488)\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = **187**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488)\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences\n\nTotal 8's = 48 + 49 + 0 = **97**\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = **90**\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each set of 10 numbers contributes one 4 in the units place. So, how many such sets are there? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, that's not quite right because the last set might not complete. Let me check: the last number in the units place would be 484, which is 48*10 + 4, so yes, that's correct. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is within 488, so 48 times is correct. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0 to 488, we have 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each contributes 10 numbers, so that's 5*10=50. But wait, the last range is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. But wait, the last number is 488, which is included in the units place as 8. So, 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digits go up to 488, which is 488, so yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range contributes 10 numbers. How many such ranges are there? From 0 to 488, we have 4 ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Wait, but 488 is beyond 389, so 480-488 is another range? Wait, no, because 480-488 is the hundreds place, but the tens digit in 480 is 8. Wait, no, 480-488: the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. Wait, but in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, that's an additional 9. So, total for tens place: 4 ranges of 10 (40) plus 9 in the 480-488 range, totaling 49. Wait, but let me think again. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, 97 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the difference is number of 4's minus number of 8's: 187 - 97 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For 8's: units 48, tens 49, hundreds 0. 48+49=97. 187-97=90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let me confirm: 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488-480+1=9. So, that's correct. So, 4 ranges of 10 (40) plus 9, totaling 49. So, that's correct. So, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can calculate how many such numbers exist. The last number in this sequence is 484, which is 484 = 4 + 10*(n-1). Let's solve for n: 484 = 4 + 10*(n-1) => 480 = 10*(n-1) => n-1 = 48 => n = 49. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 484 is the 49th term, but starting from 4, each step is 10, so the number of terms should be (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on. The highest such number before 488 is 440-449. So, how many ranges are there? 40-49: 1 range, 140-149: 2nd, 240-249: 3rd, 340-349: 4th, 440-449: 5th. So, 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Adding all these up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, then 18, 28,...,488. The number of terms can be found by ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's check each range. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9). So, total in tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the hundreds place with 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times. So, digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's.

But wait, the last set would be 484, which is within 488, so that's correct. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 4's. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's 1 range. Then, each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, etc.) has one such range. So, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 4's, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.

Let's see, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many such numbers there are. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, but wait, does 488 include an 8? Yes, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, 488 is included, so that's 49 times? Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 8. Let me think: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 8's. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 80-89: 1 range. Then, each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, etc.) has one such range. So, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges. Each contributes 10 8's, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. So, 40 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, there are 89 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 98. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For the 4's: units place: 48, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. Total: 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. That seems correct. For the 8's: units place: 49, tens place: 40, hundreds place: 0. Total: 49 + 40 = 89. That also seems correct. So, 187 - 89 = 98. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the units place for 8's. The units place for 8's goes up to 488. So, the last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Let me list a few to confirm: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Correct. Similarly, for 4's in the units place, the last number is 484, which is 484 - 4 = 480, so 480/10 = 48, plus 1 gives 49? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the units place for 4's: the first is 4, then 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many terms? Let's calculate: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake there. Let me think again. When I calculated the units place for 4's, I did 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so I took 48. But actually, the last page with a 4 in the units place is 484, which is 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, so the integer part is 48, but since 484 is included, it's 49 times? Wait, no, because 484 is the 48th occurrence. Let me think differently: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, that's 49 times. But earlier, I thought it was 48. So, I must have made a mistake. So, units place for 4's is 49, not 48. Similarly, for the tens place, I had 50, which was correct because 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, that's different from before. So, I must have miscalculated earlier. Let me recalculate. Units place for 4's: 49. Tens place: 50. Hundreds place: 89. Total: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, for 8's: units place: 49, tens place: 40, hundreds place: 0. Total: 49 + 40 = 89. So, the difference is 188 - 89 = 99. Wait, so I had an error in the initial count of 4's in the units place. I thought it was 48, but it's actually 49. So, the correct total number of 4's is 188, and 8's are 89, so the difference is 99. Hmm, but let me double-check the units place for 4's again. The numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? Let's see: 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1) = 480. So, n-1 = 48. So, n = 49. Yes, 49 terms. So, units place for 4's is 49. So, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. 8's: 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 89. So, difference is 188 - 89 = 99. So, the answer should be 99 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check again. Maybe I'm overcounting somewhere. Let me think about the hundreds place for 4's: from 400 to 488. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. For the tens place, the ranges are 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Units place: 49, as calculated. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For 8's: units place is 49, tens place is 40. So, 49 + 40 = 89. So, difference is 188 - 89 = 99. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, there are 99 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range has 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range has 10 numbers, totaling 40.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 40 = 89.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 99.\n\n$\\boxed{99}$"

    "text": " To find how many such numbers there are, I can calculate how many sets of 10 are there in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the last set would end at 480, right? Because 480 + 4 = 484, and then 490 would be beyond 488. So, from 4 to 484, that's 48 numbers. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, units place gives me 48 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, each of these 10 numbers has a 4 in the tens place. Similarly, 140-149, 240-249, etc. So, how many such hundreds are there in 488? Well, let's see. The first set is 40-49, that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10. 240-249, another 10. 340-349, another 10. 440-449, another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, let me check. 40-49: 10 fours. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So, that's 5 sets, each with 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is up to 449, and 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place is where the number is 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, let me confirm: 400 is the first, then 401, up to 488. So, yes, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them all up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total number of 4's is 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing an 8 in the units place. The last one would be 488, which is included. So, units place gives 48 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8's in the tens place occur in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, let's count how many sets of 100 have 80-89. From 0-99: 80-89 is one set. Then 100-199: 180-189 is another set. 200-299: 280-289. 300-399: 380-389. 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, how many sets of 10 in the tens place? Let's see: Each full set (like 80-89) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 0-399, we have 4 sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 eights. So, 4 * 10 = 40 eights. Then, in 400-488, the tens place 8's occur in 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, total number of 8's is 97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units: 48, tens: 50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units:48, tens:49, hundreds:0. 48+49=97. 187-97=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. Subtracting these gives 187 - 97 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " To find how many such numbers there are, I can calculate how many times 10 fits into 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the last set would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the last 4 in the units place is at 484. So, actually, it's 48 times. But wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, the number of 4's in the units place is (488 // 10) = 48 times because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take the integer part, which is 48. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, for each hundred, there's a block where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 5 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but in the last block, 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only up to 449, right? Because 450-488 have tens digits 5-8. So, the number of 4's in the tens place is 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, but the last block might not go up to 449. Wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 488, so the 4's in the tens place from 40-449 are 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers. So that's 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but let me think again: 0-99: 40-49: 10 numbers. 100-199: 140-149: 10. 200-299: 240-249:10. 300-399: 340-349:10. 400-488: 440-449:10. So, yes, 5 blocks, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Wait, but let me check: 400 is the first, then 401, up to 488. So, yes, 488 -400 +1=89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The last number is 488, which is 48*10 +8, so the count is 488//10=48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence? Wait, no, because 8,18,...,488. The first is 8 (1st), 18 (2nd), ..., 488 (49th). So, how many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. Wait, but earlier with 4's, I thought it was 48. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again. For 4's in units place: numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. The last number is 484, which is 48*10 +4=484. So, number of terms is 48. But for 8's, the last number is 488, which is 48*10 +8=488, so number of terms is 49. So, units place for 8's:49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, let's count how many blocks there are. Each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, etc.) has one block where the tens digit is 8. So, from 0-99:80-89:10 numbers. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, total in tens place: 4 blocks with 10 each, and 1 block with 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =49+49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (4's) -98 (8's)=89. Wait, that's a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=187-98=89. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me double-check the units place for 4's. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then 14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Wait, that contradicts my earlier calculation. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate the units place for 4's. The numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place for 4's is 49, not 48. Similarly, for 8's, units place is 49 as I had earlier. So, that changes things. So, for 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. So, difference=188-98=90. Wait, that's different. So, I think I made a mistake in the initial count for 4's in units place. It should be 49, not 48. Because 484 is the last number ending with 4, and that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place for 4's:49. Tens place:50. Hundreds place:89. Total 4's:49+50+89=188. 8's:49+49=98. So, difference=188-98=90. Wait, but earlier I thought the units place for 4's was 48, but now it's 49. Let me confirm: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10, how many numbers? The formula is ((last - first)/step)+1. So, (484-4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, yes, 49 numbers. So, I had made a mistake earlier by thinking it was 48, but it's actually 49. So, total 4's=188, 8's=98. Difference=90. Wait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. I had 5 blocks: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. And hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's, units place:49, tens place:49. So, 98. So, difference=188-98=90. Wait, but earlier I thought the answer was 89, but now it's 90. Which is correct? Let me recount the units place for 4's. 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? Let's list them: 4 (1),14(2),24(3),...,484(49). Yes, 49 terms. So, units=49. So, total 4's=49+50+89=188. 8's=49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, earlier I thought the answer was 89, but that was due to a miscalculation.

    "text": " To find how many such numbers there are, I can divide 488 by 10 and take the integer part. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so there are 48 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 40-49: that's one block, 140-149: another, 240-249: another, 340-349: another, and 440-449: another. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488, so all 5 blocks are complete. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. So, 4's appear 187 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is included. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, the count is 48 + 1 = 49. Because from 8 to 488, that's 49 numbers. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's see how many blocks there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: how many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, for the first four blocks, each has 10 numbers, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. The last block has 9 numbers. So total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8's appear 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Yeah, that seems right. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** Every 10 pages, 4 appears once. From 4, 14, ..., 484: 48 times.\n- **Tens place:** Every 100 pages, 4 appears 10 times in each block (40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 5 such blocks (40-449), contributing 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** From 400 to 488, 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** Every 10 pages, 8 appears once. From 8, 18, ..., 488: 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** Every 100 pages, 8 appears 10 times in each block (80-89, 180-189, etc.). The last block (480-488) contributes 9 times. Total: 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** No pages from 800-899, so 0 times.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **89**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " How many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the last page is 488, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484. To find how many 4's are in the units place, I can calculate how many times 4 appears every 10 numbers. The number of groups of 10 in 488 is 48 full groups (since 48*10=480) and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each group of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 48 groups give 48 fours, and in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the next 4 would be at 484, which is the 48th group's 4, so the 481-488 range doesn't add another 4 in the units place. Wait, no, 484 is part of the 480 group, right? Because 484 is 48*10 + 4. So actually, the 484 is included in the 48 groups. So, the units place gives 48 fours. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is indeed within 488. So, 48 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in 1-100, 40-49 is one range. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 would be up to 449, but our book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488. So, how many ranges is that? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50 fours. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, pages 400 to 488 have 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 fours. Now, let me add up the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last page is 488, so the last 8 in the units place would be 488. How many such numbers? From 1 to 488, the number of 8's in the units place is the number of times 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then an extra 8 in 488. So, 48 +1=49. Wait, let me check: 488 is included, so from 8,18,...,488. So, how many terms? The first term is 8, the last term is 488, and the common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place, such as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in 1-100, 80-89 is one range. Then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be the next range, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, but since we're counting the tens place, 480-488 have 8 in the tens place, but it's only 9 numbers. Wait, but I was considering ranges like 80-89, which have 10 numbers. So, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, how many ranges? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 ranges. But the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so yes, 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the number of fours is 187, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 187-98=89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours: units place: 48 fours. Tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place:89 fours. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. Now, for the eights: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. So, there are 89 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check the tens place for eights again. I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. Similarly, for fours in the tens place, I had 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 fours, so 5*10=50. That's correct. And hundreds place for fours is 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 48+50+89=187 fours. Eights: units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, 187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** The digit 4 appears in the units place for every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 48 such groups (488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups), contributing 48 fours.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for every 100 numbers in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 fours, totaling 50 fours.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, contributing 89 fours.\n   - **Total fours:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187 fours.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place for every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers (including 488), contributing 49 eights.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 5 such ranges, but the last range (480-488) has only 9 numbers. Thus, 4 ranges contribute 10 eights each (40) and the last range contributes 9, totaling 49 eights.\n   - **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n   - **Total eights:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98 eights.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of fours: 187\n   - Number of eights: 98\n   - Difference: 187 - 98 = 89\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " To find how many such numbers there are, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, and then check the remainder. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, the last group ends at 488, so does 484 count? Yes, because 484 is within the 480-488 range. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then each hundred has one such range. So, from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is only up to 488, so the range 440-449 is still within 488. So, how many ranges? 40-49: 1 range, 140-149: another, 240-249: another, 340-349: another, and 440-449: another. That's 5 ranges. Each has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Well, 488 minus 400 plus 1 (since both ends are inclusive) is 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 full groups, each contributing an 8 in the units place. The last group ends at 488, which is 8 in the units place, so that's included. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: 80-89 is one, 180-189 is another, 280-289 another, 380-389 another. Now, does 480-489 fall within 488? 480-489 would be another range, but since the book only goes up to 488, the range is 480-488. So, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place here? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 numbers instead of 10. So, the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10, so 4*10=40. Plus the 9 from 480-488, so 40 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 +49=97. So, 97 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484 \u2192 48 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488 \u2192 48 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 4 ranges \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n**Total 8's:** 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " To find how many such numbers there are, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, the last group would be 480-488, where the units digit is 4 only in 484. So, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 49. Wait, no, let me check that again. If I take the floor division, 488 divided by 10 is 48, but since 488 itself is 48*10 + 8, the number of 4's in the units place would be 48 times, because each decade (like 0-9, 10-19, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place, except maybe the last one. Wait, no, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the last complete set is 480-488, but 484 is within that set, so that's the 48th 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these sets contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. But wait, since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449, which is within 488. So, how many such sets are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first set, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times the 4 appears in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. The numbers from 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. Let's see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Wait, but the hundreds place is only for numbers 400 and above, up to 488. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times the 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through each digit position again: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then in the last partial decade (480-488), 488 is included, so that's an extra 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in sets like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set. Each of these sets contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such sets there are: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers (480-488), but since we're counting the tens digit, each number in 480-488 has 8 in the tens place, so 9 numbers, but wait, no: 480 is 4 8 0, so the tens digit is 8. Similarly, 481 is 4 8 1, etc., up to 488. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, each set (except maybe the last one) has 10 numbers, but the last set has 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets with 10 each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 48 occurrences (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488.

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can calculate how many such numbers exist. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the last group would be 480-488, which includes 484. So, actually, it's 49 times because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens plus one more 4 in 484. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first such number is 4, then every 10 after that. So, the number of 4's in the units place would be the number of times 4 appears as the units digit. So, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning there are 48 complete cycles, each contributing one 4, and then an additional 4 in the 484th position. So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but the 48th cycle would end at 480, and then 484 is the next 4 in units place. So yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. So, numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count them: 40-49: 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 would go up to 449, which is less than 488, so that's fine. So, each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers, so 5 ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). So 5 ranges \u00d7 10 numbers each = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 times 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. So, numbers from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. Now, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, total 4's in hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** The 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, and then an additional 8 in 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. So, numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many ranges? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 ranges with 10 numbers each and one range with 9. So, total 4\u00d710 +9=49. So, 49 times 8's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. So, numbers from 800 to 899. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, hundreds digit 8 doesn't appear at all. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** \n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. \n   - There are 49 such numbers (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, giving 48 full groups plus one more in 484).\n\n2. **Tens place:** \n   - 4 appears in the tens digit in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. \n   - There are 5 such ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** \n   - 4 appears in 400-488. \n   - This range includes 89 numbers.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** \n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. \n   - There are 49 such numbers (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, giving 48 full groups plus one more in 488).\n\n2. **Tens place:** \n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. \n   - There are 4 full ranges of 10 and one range of 9 (480-488), totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** \n   - 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488. \n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " To find how many such numbers there are, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4. So that's 48 times. Wait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, the last group is 480-488, which includes 484 as the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, 400-488 is a partial block. Let me count each block: - 40-49: 10 numbers. - 140-149: 10 numbers. - 240-249: 10 numbers. - 340-349: 10 numbers. - 440-449: 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 times. Wait, but 488 is beyond 449, so 440-449 is fully included. So yes, 5 blocks, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 is at 488. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's see: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: Here, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the tens place, for 480-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480, 481, ..., 488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9. So, total for tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up units and tens places: 48 (units) + 49 (tens) = 97 times the digit 8 appears. Now, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " How many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, let me check: the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 40-49: that's one block. Then 140-149: another. 240-249: another. 340-349: another. 440-449: another. So that's 5 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, the last block is 440-449, and our book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 488. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding them all up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, meaning 48 times. But wait, the last number would be 488, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. Let's count the blocks: 80-89: 1 block. 180-189: another. 280-289: another. 380-389: another. So, 4 blocks. Each has 10 numbers, so 4 x 10 = 40. But wait, does 80-89 go beyond 488? No, because 89 is less than 488, so all these blocks are valid. So, 40 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never is 8. So, 0 times. Adding up the units and tens places: 48 + 40 = 88. So, the digit 8 appears 88 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 88 (number of 8's) = 99. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For the 4's: units place: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For the 8's: units:48, tens:40, hundreds:0. 48+40=88. So, 187-88=99. Hmm, that's correct.

    "text": " To find out how many times this happens, I can divide 488 by 10 and take the integer part. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, does 488 include 484? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, that gives me 48 fours in the units place. But wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10, so the number of 4's in the units place is indeed floor(488/10) = 48. But actually, when the last number is 488, the last 4 in the units place is 484, so yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So yes, 5 blocks, each with 10, so 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This occurs from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, 48 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This happens in blocks of 100: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me check each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, the 8's occur in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This occurs from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, 97 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (fours) - 97 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " To find how many such numbers there are, I can calculate how many sets of 10 are there in 488. Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the last set would be 484, which is within 488, so actually, it's 48 + 1? Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, and 484 is the last 4 in the units place before 494, which is beyond 488. So maybe it's 48 times? Wait, let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then 14, 24,..., 484. The number of terms in this sequence can be found by (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on. Since the book goes up to 488, the last range with a tens digit of 4 is 440-449. So, how many ranges? 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place, which would be from 400 to 488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8's in the units place are numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, similar to the 4's, let's find how many such numbers there are. The last one would be 488, which is included. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Each of these ranges except the last one contributes 10 numbers. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488). So, total 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. So, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n   - **Tens Place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 terms.\n   - **Tens Place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. The last range has 9 terms, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 8 does not appear as there are no pages from 800-899.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - More 4's than 8's = 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " How many such numbers are there? Well, from 4 to 484, each set of 10 numbers contributes one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. Let me calculate that: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 itself ends with 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484, which is the 48th group. So, 48 times. But wait, let me check: starting from 4, 14, ..., 484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Oh, I see, I made a mistake earlier. It's actually 49 times because 484 is the 49th term. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 1-99, we have 40-49, which is 10 numbers. In 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10 numbers. 300-399: 340-349, 10 numbers. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many ranges? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, looking at the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there from 400-488? Let's see, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 89 numbers. So, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 4's. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? Let's calculate. The last number is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers contributes one 8. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's count the ranges: 80-89 is in 1-99, 180-189 in 100-199, 280-289 in 200-299, 380-389 in 300-399. Wait, 480-489 would be another range, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of the range. So, does 480-488 count as a full range? Well, 480-489 would have 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, in the tens place, for 8, we have four full ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10 8's, and then 480-488, which contributes 9 8's. Wait, no, because 480-488 is part of the hundreds place, but in the tens place, it's the same as 80-89 in the tens place, but shifted by hundreds. Wait, no, actually, in the tens place, 480-488 has 8 in the tens place as well. So, for example, 480 is 4 in hundreds, 8 in tens, 0 in units. So, in the tens place, 480-488 would contribute 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges of 10, plus 9, so 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 8's. Now, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the number of terms in this sequence can be calculated by dividing 488 by 10 and taking the integer part. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the last group might not have 10 numbers. Let me check: 488 \u00f7 10 gives 48 with a remainder of 8, so the last term would be 484, which is within 488. So, 48 times. But wait, does 488 include 484? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in the first hundred (1-100), there's 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then in 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? 449 is less than 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's count how many such numbers there are. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. The last term would be 488, which is included, so that's 49 times because 488 is the 49th term. Wait, let me check: from 8 to 488 with a step of 10, how many terms? The formula is ((last term - first term) / step) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40. But wait, let me check if 380-389 is within 488. Yes, 389 is less than 488, so that's included. So, 40 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, there are 89 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 89 = 98. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For the 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For the 8's: units=49, tens=40, hundreds=0. 49+40=89. So, 187-89=98. Hmm, but wait, when I calculated the units place for 8's, I got 49, but let me check again. From 8 to 488, step 10: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So that's correct. Similarly, for 4's in the units place, it's 48 because 488 \u00f710=48.8, so 48 full groups, but wait, 484 is the last one, which is 48th term, right? Because 48\u00d710=480, so 484 is the 48th term. So, units place for 4's is 48, which is correct. So, 187-89=98. So, there are 98 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 4's would be 89, but let me confirm. From 400 to 488, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89. So, that's correct. So, the total 4's are 48 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=187. 8's are 49 (units)+40 (tens)=89. So, 187-89=98. So, the answer should be 98 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " To find how many such numbers there are, I can calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. From 1 to 488, the number of terms in the sequence 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The first term is 4, and the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d. Here, a_1 = 4, d = 10, a_n = 484. So, 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10 => 480 = (n-1)*10 => n-1 = 48 => n = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's count the 4's in the tens place. These would be numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, 440-449 is included, but 540-549 isn't. Let me see: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). There are 4 hundreds in 488: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. Wait, actually, 488 is in the 400s, so we have 5 sets: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488. But for the tens place, in each full hundred (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.), the tens digit is 4 exactly 10 times. So for 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers). Similarly, 101-200: 140-149 (10), 201-300: 240-249 (10), 301-400: 340-349 (10). Now, 401-488: The tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, and then 480-488, but wait, 480-488 has tens digit 8, so actually, in the 400s, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens place 4's: 4 sets of 10 each, so 4*10=40. Wait, but wait, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus 10 from 440-449, so total 50? Wait, no, because 401-488 is part of the 400s, so I think I'm overcounting. Let me think again. From 1-400, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Each hundred contributes 10, so 4 hundreds would contribute 4*10=40. But wait, 1-400 includes 400, so yes, 4 hundreds each with 10, so 40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is another 10. So total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50. Wait, but 401-488 is part of the 400s, so the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so total tens place 4's: 40 (from 1-400) +10=50. Wait, but 400 is included in 1-400, so that's correct. So 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 =89 numbers. So the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So total number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) =49+50=99+89=188. Wait, but wait, let me check that again. Units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. So total 4's:188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers:8,18,28,...,488. So how many terms? The first term is 8, last term is 488. The common difference is 10. So using the same formula: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)*d. 488 =8 + (n-1)*10 => 480=(n-1)*10 =>n-1=48 =>n=49. So 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8's in the tens place occur in numbers like 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is included. So let's count how many sets of 100 have the tens digit as 8. From 1-100:80-89 (10 numbers). 101-200:180-189 (10). 201-300:280-289 (10). 301-400:380-389 (10). 401-488:480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. Wait, 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488-480=8, but inclusive, so 9 numbers. So in the 400s, the tens digit 8 occurs in 9 numbers. So total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (from 1-400) and 9 in 480-488. So 4*10=40 +9=49. So 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So hundreds place 8's:0. So total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake. Let me recount the 4's. Units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So 188-98=90. So there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For the 4's in the tens place, I had 50. Let me confirm that. From 1-100:10, 101-200:10, 201-300:10, 301-400:10, and 401-488:10 (from 440-449). So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. Yes, that's correct. For the 8's in the tens place, I had 4 sets of 10 (1-400) and 9 in 480-488, totaling 49. That seems right. So the difference is indeed 90. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " To find how many such numbers there are, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that would mean 48 complete groups, each with one 4, so 48 times. But I should check if 488 is included. The last 4 in the units place would be 484, which is less than 488, so yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's a total of 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Wait, but I need to check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds place is the third digit, so for numbers 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. Now, let me check if that makes sense. Wait, 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187. Hmm, but I'm not sure if I counted correctly. Let me double-check the units place. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place is the number of times 4 appears in 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. I thought it was 48, but it's actually 49. Because 484 is the 49th term. So, units place: 49 times. Similarly, for the tens place, I had 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 50 times. For the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, that's different from my initial count. So, I must have miscalculated earlier. Let me correct that. So, units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. Total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place separately. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in numbers like 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The common difference is 10, so the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. So, let's count how many ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is one range, contributing 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is another, 10 numbers. Similarly, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 numbers, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can calculate how many such numbers there are. From 1 to 488, the number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10, plus any extra if the last number is beyond that. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 48 times 10 is 480, so the last group would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the last 4 in the units place is 484. So, that's 48 times. Wait, but 480 is a multiple of 10, so from 1 to 480, there are 480/10 = 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Then from 481 to 488, the next number with 4 in the units place would be 484, which is within this range. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, no, because 480 is included, so from 1 to 480, it's 48 times. Then from 481 to 488, the next 4 in the units place is 484, which is one more. So total 49 times in the units place. Hmm, but wait, 480 is included in the 1-480 range, so 480 is the 48th occurrence. Then 484 is the 49th. So yes, 49 times in the units place for 4's. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-488, the blocks are: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 times, so 5\u00d710=50 times. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400 to 488. So, numbers from 400 to 488 have 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but wait, let me check that again. Units place: 49 times, tens place: 50 times, hundreds place: 89 times. So total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so from 1 to 488, the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, from 1 to 480, that's 48 times (8,18,...,480-8=488? Wait, no, 480 is 480, so 480 +8=488. So, 488 is the last one. So, 488 is included, so that's 48 times? Wait, 480 is the 48th multiple, but 480 +8=488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, so 488 is the 49th 8 in the units place. So, units place for 8's: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place, such as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's see how many full blocks there are. Each block contributes 10 times in the tens place. So, from 0-488, the blocks are: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 for all these 9 numbers. So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last block contributes 9. So total in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 +9=49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place for 8's: 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98 times. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. Difference is 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me check again if I counted correctly. For 4's in units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? The formula is floor((488 -4)/10) +1. So, (488-4)=484, 484/10=48.4, floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449). Each contributes 10, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So 4's total 188. For 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. So, same as 4's, 49 times. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks is 10 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 times in the tens place. So, total tens place for 8's is 40+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So 8's total 98. So the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 times. Correct. So, yes, 89 in hundreds place for 4's. So, the total 4's are 188, 8's are 98, so 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me think again. Is there a possibility that in the tens place for 8's, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times in the tens place. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49. Correct. So, yes, 49 in tens place for 8's. So, 49+49=98. So, yes, 90 difference. Wait, but wait, I think I might have missed something in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me see: 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. So, 89. So, 4's total 188, 8's total 98, difference 90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89 (488 - 400 + 1).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40, and the last block contributes 9 (480-488).\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in the book have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " To find how many such numbers there are, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, and then take the integer part. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so there are 48 occurrences. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last 4 in the units place. Let me check: from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. It should be 49 times because 488 \u00f7 10 is 48.8, but since we start at 4, the count is 49. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, and 484 is the last 4 in the units place. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 would be up to 449, but the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488. Let me count how many such groups there are. Each group has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. The hundreds digits can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, for hundreds digit 0: 40-49 (10 numbers) hundreds digit 1: 140-149 (10 numbers) hundreds digit 2: 240-249 (10 numbers) hundreds digit 3: 340-349 (10 numbers) hundreds digit 4: 440-449 (10 numbers) So, that's 5 groups, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50 occurrences. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4 for 400-488. But actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, it's 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, each of these numbers has 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, how many terms? Let's see: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The formula is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, let's count how many groups: hundreds digits can be 0,1,2,3,4. For hundreds digit 0: 80-89 (10 numbers) hundreds digit 1: 180-189 (10 numbers) hundreds digit 2: 280-289 (10 numbers) hundreds digit 3: 380-389 (10 numbers) hundreds digit 4: 480-488. Now, how many numbers are there from 480 to 488? That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for hundreds digit 4, it's 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 groups of 10 and 1 group of 9. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I thought maybe the hundreds place for 4's was 89, but let me confirm: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, I had 4 groups of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one group of 9 (480-488). So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. That's correct. Units place for 8's is 49, same as for 4's. So, 49+49=98. So, yes, the difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the number of 4's in the units place would be the number of times 4 appears in each set of 10 numbers. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then an extra 8 numbers. In each set of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think again. If I consider the total number of units digits, from 1 to 488, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in the units place, except possibly the last set if 488 isn't a multiple of 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, for the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times, plus one more time for the digits 0 to 8 in the last partial set. So, for the digit 4, it appears 48 times in the units place, plus one more time in the last set (484), making it 49 times. Okay, so units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these sets contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such sets there are. From 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 1-100, 40-49 is one set (10 numbers). Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets in total. Each set contributes 10 numbers, so 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. Wait, is that right? Let me check. 400 is the first, then 401, 402,... up to 488. So, yes, that's 89 numbers. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up all the places where 4 appears: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me compute that: 49 + 50 = 99, and 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that is. From 1 to 488, the number of 8's in the units place is the number of full sets of 10, which is 48 full sets (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8). Each set contributes one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so that's correct. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in sets like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. Let me count how many full sets there are. From 1 to 488, the tens digit is 8 in the following sets: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers). So, that's 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total numbers where the tens digit is 8: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, tens place: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up all the places where 8 appears: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " How many such numbers are there? Well, from 4 to 484, that's every 10th number. So, how many terms are there? Let's see, the first term is 4, which is 4 + 0*10, and the last term is 484, which is 4 + 48*10. So, that's 49 terms because 484 is the 49th term (since 484 = 4 + (48)*10). Wait, no, actually, 484 is the 49th term because starting from 4 (which is 4 + 0*10) as the first term, each step adds 10. So, 484 is the 49th term because (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many numbers are in each set. Each set has 10 numbers. How many such sets are there? From 40-49 (that's one set), then each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another set. So, how many sets? Let's see: 40-49: 1 set, then 140-149: another set, 240-249: another, 340-349: another, and 440-449: another. So that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers. So, 5*10 = 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. Wait, but wait, the last set is 440-449, which is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's count how many terms. The first term is 8, which is 8 + 0*10, and the last term is 488, which is 8 + (48*10). So, how many terms? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range. Let's count each set. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-488: how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, each set except the last one has 10 numbers. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9. So, total in the tens place: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 times. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, 49 times 8 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.
