    "text": " Wait, does 484 count? Since 484 is less than 488, yes. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. Let me calculate that: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the 48th group ends at 480, and then from 481 to 488, that's 8 more pages. So, in the units place, from 1 to 480, there are 48 4's, and then in 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no additional 4's. So total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, the ranges are 40-49 (which is within 1-488), 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, how many such ranges? From 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, I should check if all these ranges are within 488. The last range is 440-449, which is fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, but I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499. But since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. So, 48 8's in the units place. Now, check if there's an extra 8 in the units place beyond 480. From 481 to 488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. So, in 481-488, the units digit 8 occurs once (at 488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but 480-489 is beyond 488, so only up to 488. So, how many ranges? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, each of the first four ranges has 10 8's in the tens place, and the last range has 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that seems too high. Let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount the 4's and 8's. Starting with 4's: Units place: 48 times. Tens place: 5 ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Total 4's: 48+50+89=187. That seems correct. Now for 8's: Units place: from 1-488, every 10 numbers have one 8, so 48 times. Plus, in 481-488, 488 has an 8, so that's one more, making it 49. Tens place: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place: none. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Let me check that again. For the tens place of 4's, the ranges are 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 ranges, 10 each, 50. That seems correct. And 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's valid. So, 50 4's in tens place. Similarly, for 8's in tens place, the ranges are 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 4 full ranges (80-89, etc.) each with 10, and 480-488 which is 9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. That seems correct. So, I think my initial calculation is right, and the difference is 89. But wait, let me think again. Maybe I'm overcounting the 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, from 400-488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 =89. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's. That's correct. So, total 4's:48+50+89=187. 8's:49+49=98. 187-98=89. So, the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, there are 48 full groups and then a partial group from 480 to 488. So, 48 times 1 (for each group) plus one more 4 in 484. Wait, but 484 is within 480-488, so that's an extra 4. So, total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 times, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each number contributes one 4 in the hundreds digit. So, that's 89 times. Wait, but let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. So, total number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers ending with 4? The first is 4, then every 10. So, 4 + 10*(n-1) \u2264 488. Let's solve for n: 10*(n-1) \u2264 484 \u2192 n-1 \u2264 48.4 \u2192 n \u2264 49.4, so n=49 times. So, 49 in units place. Tens place: as before, 5 ranges (40-49, 140-149, etc.), each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place. So, 89. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The last number is 488, which ends with 8. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, how many ranges? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 4 ranges with 10 each, and one range with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so yes, that's correct. So, 49 times in tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in hundreds place. So, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that's a big difference. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. So, difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. I think I did everything right. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first number with 4 in the units place is 4, and the last one within 488 is 484. To find how many numbers there are, I can subtract 4 from 484 and then divide by 10, then add 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit from the right. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. From 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, I need to check if 440-449 is within 488. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, it's included. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. Let's see how many numbers that is. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. Starting from 8, each step is 10. So, the numbers are 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. To find the count, I can use the formula: ((last number - first number) / step) + 1. Here, last number is 488, first is 8, step is 10. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the tens place. That would be ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let me check each range: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: how many numbers? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, total 8's in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me make sure. The first four ranges each have 10, and the last one has 9 because 488 is the last page. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book is only 488 pages, there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " I need to find how many such numbers there are. Let's see, starting from 4 and adding 10 each time. The last one before 488 would be 484. To find how many terms there are, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the range 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 occurrences of 8 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

    "text": " So, how many times does this happen? Well, starting from 4, each subsequent occurrence is 10 apart. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of times 10 fits into 488, but considering only the units digit. Let me think: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? That would be every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? The last number ending with 4 before 488 would be 484, which is 48*10 + 4. So, yes, 48 times. But wait, let me check: from 1 to 480, how many numbers end with 4? It's 480 / 10 = 48. Then, 484 is the 49th occurrence, but 488 is beyond that, so actually, it's 49 times because 484 is included. Hmm, maybe I should calculate it differently. The number of numbers ending with 4 is the floor of (488 + 1)/10, which is 48.9, so 48 times. Wait, no, because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 is not a multiple of 10, we add 1 if the remainder is >= the digit we're looking for. Wait, maybe a better way is to calculate how many complete decades there are and then check the remainder. The number of complete decades is 48 (since 48*10=480), and then from 481 to 488, we check if there's a number ending with 4. The next number after 480 ending with 4 is 484, which is within 481-488, so that's an extra 1. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, so 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are up to 488. The first range is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, all 5 ranges are included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This happens from 400-488. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Numbers ending with 8 from 1 to 488. Similar to the 4's, but let's check. The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor(488/10) = 48, but check if 488 ends with 8. It ends with 8, so we add 1. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This happens in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many ranges: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last). So, total numbers with 8 in the tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the difference is 4's minus 8's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, and we include 484).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, and we include 488).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last range contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in any page number since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, there are 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, and then the 48th group ends at 480, so the next number is 481, which doesn't have a 4 in the units place. Wait, no, 484 is within 488, so actually, the number of 4's in the units place is the number of times 4 appears in 1-488. So, for each ten, there's one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 tens, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, there's no 4 in the units place, so total units place 4's: 48. Wait, but 488 is included, so 488 is 488, which is beyond 480, so does 488 have a 4 in the units place? No, it's 488, so 8 in the units place. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d710=50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, but 488 is included, so 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, from 1 to 488, how many 8's in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then 488 itself, which is 488, so the units digit is 8. So, 48 full groups (1-480) give 48 8's, and then 488 adds one more, making it 49. So, units place: 49 8's. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. Let's see how many full blocks there are. Each block is 100 numbers, so 80-89 is in 1-100, 180-189 in 101-200, etc. So, how many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. The last block, 480-488, is only 9 numbers (480-488), so the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks \u00d710=40, plus 9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Wait, that's 98 8's. Wait, but earlier I thought units place was 49 and tens place was 49, so total 98. So, now, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187-98=89. Wait, but let me double-check my counting because that seems like a big difference. Let me verify the 4's again. Units place: from 1-488, every 10 numbers has one 4 in the units place. So, 488/10=48.8, so 48 full times, but wait, 488 is included, so 488 is 488, which is 488, so the units digit 4's would be at 4,14,...,484. So, how many? Let's see, 484 is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 4's in the units place. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5\u00d710=50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. So, total 4's: 48+50+89=187. That seems correct. Now, 8's: units place, every 10 numbers, 8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so how many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10: 8,18,...,488. So, the number of terms is (488-8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40. The last block, 480-488, is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40+9=49. Hundreds place: none, as before. So, total 8's: 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. When counting the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, correct. But wait, 488-400+1=89. So, that's correct. Similarly, for the 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's there. So, yeah, 49+49=98. So, the difference is 187-98=89. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10, contributing 48 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (including 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The first four blocks contribute 40 occurrences, and 480-488 adds 9 more, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book doesn't reach 800.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Wait, does 484 count? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. Let me calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place would be the number of complete groups of 10. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). Each group contributes one 4, so that's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial group (481-488), does the units digit include a 4? Let's see: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 484 is in this group, which adds one more 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens digit. The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's check how many such ranges exist up to 488. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's valid. So, total tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, total 4's in the hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours printed. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? As before, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, and then the last partial group (481-488). Let's check the last group: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 488 is in this group, which adds one more 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens digit. The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's count each range: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the end). So, let's add these up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, total tens place 8's: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights printed. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units place was 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. For the 8's: units 49, tens 49, so 98. 188 - 98 is indeed 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit surprised because I thought maybe the numbers would be closer. Let me check the tens place for 8's again. I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five ranges. The first four are full (10 each), and the last is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. That's correct. Similarly, for the 4's in the tens place, I had 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's five ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. And hundreds place for 4's is 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89. That's correct. So, 188 fours and 98 eights. The difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place. So, total number of 4's in the units place would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, I think it's 48 times. Wait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, the 48th occurrence would be at 480, and then 484 is the next one, but 488 is beyond 484. So, maybe it's 49? Let me check: from 4, 14, ..., 484, that's 484/10 = 48.4, so 48 full groups, and then one more at 484, making it 49. Wait, but 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4, so maybe it's 49?

The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to N is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra if the last digit is >=4. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, since the remainder is 8, which is less than 4? Wait, no, the remainder is 8, but we're looking for how many 4's in the units place beyond the 48 decades. So, in the last partial decade, from 480 to 488, the units digits go from 0 to 8. So, 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in the following ranges: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place, which would be from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 here. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 +50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 8,18,28,...,488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8. Then, in the last partial decade (480-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8 in the units place. So, total 48 +1=49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last range. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 8's. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, total 4*10 +9=40+9=49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=49+49=98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the Digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Total: 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in page numbers 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 times.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188 times**\n\n**Counting the Digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - First four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers in the book have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0 times.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98 times**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " How many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks and then 8 more numbers. Each full block contributes one 4, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is within this block, adding one more 4. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, 40-49 is the first block, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, and since our book ends at 488, 440-449 is entirely within 1-488, so yes, 5 blocks. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me count how many such numbers. From 1 to 488, divided by 10 gives 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and the last partial block (481-488) includes 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100, so 80-89 is one, 180-189 another, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Wait, but let me check if 480-488 is included. The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but our book ends at 488. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480 to 488). So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, for the 400s, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89 and 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place, resulting in 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me see how many such numbers there are. Starting from 4 and going up by 10 each time, the last one before 488 would be 484. To find how many terms there are in this sequence, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: ((Last term - First term) / Common difference) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's a total of 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 here, so each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours in total. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Let's go through each digit position again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is included here. Let me check how many such numbers there are. Using the same arithmetic sequence formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Let me count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 numbers - 280-289: 10 numbers - 380-389: 10 numbers - 480-488: 9 numbers So, total eights in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check that. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 eights, so that's 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 contributes 9 eights, so total is 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " Let me figure out how many times this happens. The first occurrence is at 4, and the last is at 484. To find how many numbers there are, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. Here, the first term is 4, the last term is 484, and the common difference is 10. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many numbers that is. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many such blocks are there? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. In each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 in that hundred, which would be 40-49, but since we're starting at 401, it's 440-449. That's another 10 numbers. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but hold on, 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 40 + 10 = 50. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many times. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count these. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book has only 488 pages, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

    "text": " Wait, does 484 count? Yes, because 484 is within 488. So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers has one 4 in the units place. Let me calculate how many times that happens. The first occurrence is at 4, which is the 4th number. The last occurrence is at 484, which is the 484th number. To find how many 4's are in the units place, I can divide 484 by 10, which gives 48.4, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence because 4 + (48-1)*10 = 484. So, that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 484 exist? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, units place gives 48 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place can be 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five ranges. Each range contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10 = 50 fours. But wait, the last range is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place gives 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours from each place: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total fours are 187. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence is 488. Let me calculate how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first is 8, the next is 18, and so on. The last is 488. So, how many numbers is that? The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. To find how many terms, I can subtract 8 from 488 and divide by 10, then add 1. So, (488 - 8)/10 = 480/10 = 48, then 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-489 would be up to 488. So, how many ranges are there? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five ranges. Each range contributes 10 eights in the tens place except the last one, which is only 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, let me check: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10 = 40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights from each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 187 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 89. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That looks right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Let me calculate how many times this happens. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Well, every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The last one is 484, which is the 48th occurrence because 484 is 48*10 + 4. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's see how many sets of 100 there are. From 1-488, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, for each complete hundred, that's 10 times. There are 4 complete hundreds, so 4*10=40. But wait, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 401-409, which is 9 numbers, but actually, 401-409 has the tens digit as 0, so maybe I made a mistake. Wait, no. Let me think again. The tens place being 4 occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks is 10 numbers, so each contributes 10. So, from 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, the tens place has 50 occurrences of 4. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98+89=187. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, plus 89 is 187. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full occurrences. Let me check: the last number ending with 8 before 488 is 488 itself, which ends with 8. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many times the tens digit is 8. Each block from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9. So total in tens place is 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48+49=97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98+89=187. For 8's: units 48, tens 49, hundreds 0. 48+49=97. 187-97=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. From 1 to 488, this occurs 48 times (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, taking the integer part).\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. The last range (480-488) has 9 numbers, so total tens place 8's = 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** Since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0 occurrences.\n   - **Total 8's:** 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 187 - 97 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I need to find how many such numbers are there from 1 to 488. So, the sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term a\u2081 = 4, the common difference d = 10, and the last term a\u2099 = 484. To find the number of terms, I can use the formula for the nth term: a\u2099 = a\u2081 + (n-1)d. Plugging in the numbers: 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10. Subtracting 4 from both sides: 480 = (n-1)*10. Dividing both sides by 10: 48 = n - 1. So, n = 49. That means there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in the first 100 pages (1-100), 40-49 is one set, that's 10 numbers. Then, in 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. Similarly, in 200-299, it's 240-249, another 10. In 300-399, it's 340-349, another 10. In 400-488, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers as well. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 5*10 = 50. So, 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. So, every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours printed. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Using the same arithmetic sequence approach: a\u2081 = 8, d = 10, a\u2099 = 488. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 8: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n - 1. So, n = 49. That means 49 occurrences of 8 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: Here, it's not a full set of 10 because 488 is the last page. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, in the hundreds place, for 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, adding up: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and 1 set of 9 (480-488). So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, the total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, there are 48 full groups and then a partial group from 481 to 488. So, in the units place, the 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so 48 times from 1 to 480, and then in 484, which is within the 481-488 range. So that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48 times, but since 484 is within the range, it's actually 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as for each complete set of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so in each set, 4 appears once. So for 488 pages, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, so that's one more, making it 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 times the digit 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges are there up to 488. The first is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50 times. Now, does 480-488 have any 4's in the tens place? The tens digit in 480-488 is 8, so no 4's there. So total 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This happens from page 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4's appear 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8, checking each place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, similar to the 4's, let's see how many times 8 appears in the units place. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 is the last page, so that's one more, making it 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This happens in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many such ranges are there. The first is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. So, the first four ranges are complete, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. The last range, 480-488, is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 for all these, so 9 times. So total in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0 (for pages 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), 4 (400-488). So, the hundreds digit is never 8. Therefore, 8's do not appear in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) = 98 times. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Wait, 484 is the last one before 488. So, how many times does this happen? Well, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Let's see: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The first such number is 4 and the last is 484. To find how many terms there are, I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence. The common difference is 10, so the nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. Solving for n: 4 + 10(n-1) = 484 => 10(n-1) = 480 => n-1 = 48 => n = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place, 4 can appear as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 would be in the hundreds place as well, but I'm only considering the tens place here. Let me count each block: - 40-49: That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. - 140-149: Another 10. - 240-249: Another 10. - 340-349: Another 10. - 440-449: But wait, 440-449 is part of the hundreds place as well, but for the tens place, each of these blocks contributes 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 count here? Because when considering the tens place, yes, each of these blocks contributes 10. However, I should check if 440-449 is within the 488 pages. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 blocks, each with 10, so 50. But wait, actually, from 40-49 is the first block, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each giving 10, so 50. But wait, when I'm counting the tens place, each block of 100 numbers has exactly one block where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? Let's see: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so the last block is 401-488. So, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? In each hundred, except maybe the last one, there is a block of 10 where the tens digit is 4. So from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 1 for 410-419, and so on. So in 401-488, the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's 10 more. So total tens place 4's would be 40 +10=50. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 50, but now I'm getting 50 as well. So, maybe 50 is correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. So, any page number from 400-488 will have a hundreds digit of 4. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. So total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me check that again. Units: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Okay, so 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers. So, 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is included. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, last is 488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, 8 +10(n-1)=488 => 10(n-1)=480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 occurrences of 8 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. So, let's count each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189:10. - 280-289:10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488: Here, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 numbers. So total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but let me confirm. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except maybe the last one. So, 1-400: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, 401-488: the tens digit 8 would be in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 4 at maximum. So, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above, which doesn't happen here. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. So total 8's = 49 +49 +0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10, except the last which contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in 800-899, so 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 488 include an extra 4 in the units place? Let me check: 480 to 488 would be pages 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, 484 is the only page with a 4 in the units place in this range. So, that's one more. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. From 1 to 480, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's 48 times because 480 divided by 10 is 48. Then, from 481 to 488, there's one more 4 in 484. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? From 1 to 488, the blocks are: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, but let me check: 400 is the first, 401, ..., up to 488. So yes, 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8. But let's check the last partial cycle: 481-488. The units digit 8 occurs in 488. So, that's one more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is the last block. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, how many blocks? 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the first four blocks (80-89, etc.), each has 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 blocks * 10 = 40. The last block (480-488) has 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, so 9 more. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place starting from page 800, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers.

    "text": " So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place would be the total number of tens groups. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but we can't have a fraction of a group, so we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 is the last page. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, in the 480-488 range, the units digit 4 appears in 484. So, that's still one 4 in the units place for each group of 10, so 48 times. So, 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers as well. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place, which is the third digit. This would be from 400-488. Each number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so again, 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, in the last group, 480-488, the units digit 8 is in 488. So, that's one 8 in the units place. So, 48 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let me check each: - 80-89: 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8, and the numbers are 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. But the tens digit is 8 only when the tens digit is 8, which is from 480-488, but actually, the tens digit is 8 only when the number is between 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. However, the tens digit is 8 in all these numbers, so that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, adding up: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but let me double-check: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3, or 4. So, 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, there are 97 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 97 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 97.

So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 include a 4 in the units place? 488 ends with an 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484. So, from 4 to 484, stepping by 10 each time. Let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms here can be calculated by (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? Well, from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, the last block is 400-488, but the tens digit is 4 only up to 449, right? Because 450-488 would have a tens digit of 5,6,7,8,9. So, the last block where the tens digit is 4 is 440-449. So, that's 5 blocks in total: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-449. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, let me confirm. From 40-49: 10 numbers. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: 10. 340-349:10. 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, so 5\u00d710=50. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 starting from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, that's 89 times. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, 89 times in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 +50=99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the block. Each block where the tens digit is 8 contributes 10 numbers, except maybe the last one if it's cut short. Let's check: 80-89:10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 full blocks (each 10 numbers) and one partial block with 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 4\u00d710 +9=49. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds =49+49+0=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Then 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for page numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, let me add them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, I need to count the number of 8's in the same page numbers. Let's do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it's 488, so the last one is 488. Let me calculate how many terms. First term is 8, last term is 488, common difference 10. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let me check each range. 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: here, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1=9). So, each of the first four ranges contributes 10, and the last one contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract 8's from 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence with:\n   - First term (a\u2081) = 4\n   - Last term (a\u2099) = 484\n   - Common difference (d) = 10\n   - Number of terms (n) = ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has:\n   - First term (a\u2081) = 8\n   - Last term (a\u2099) = 488\n   - Common difference (d) = 10\n   - Number of terms (n) = ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total = 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in any page number \u2264488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first number with 4 in the units place is 4, and the last is 484. To find how many there are, I can divide 484 by 10 and take the integer part. 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, so there are 48 numbers where 4 is in the units place. But wait, 484 is the 48th such number, but since 484 is included, that's correct. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 1 to 488, the blocks are 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these 89 numbers has a 4. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, let me add them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 4 appears 187 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so there are 48 full tens, meaning 48 numbers where 8 is in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so that's correct. So, 48 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, not 10 because 488 is the last page. So, let me count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480 is included and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, yes, 49 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, 8 appears 97 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 48 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 48 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, and the last block (480-488) has 9 numbers.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = **49** occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **97**.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, that means there are 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 48 times 10 is 480, so the last page is 488, which is beyond 480. So, does that mean there's an extra 4 in the units place at 484? Let me check: 484 is within 488, so yes, that's another 4. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Because from 1 to 480, it's 48 times, and then 484 is the 49th. So, units place 4's: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in the first 100 pages (1-100), the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, that's 10 numbers. Similarly, in 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. In 200-299, it's 240-249, another 10. In 300-399, it's 340-349, another 10. In 400-488, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place 4's: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 4's: 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? From 1 to 488, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing an 8 in the units place. But wait, 48\u00d710=480, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, that's 49 times. Let me check: 8, 18, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place 8's: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 4\u00d710=40. Now, wait, 488 is beyond 389, but the next range would be 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (480-488). Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place is only in 480-488. So, does that count as an additional range? Let me think. The tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers, not 10. So, in the tens place, how many 8's? We have 4 full ranges (80-89, etc.) each with 10, and one partial range with 9. So, 4\u00d710=40 plus 9=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 4 ranges, but now I'm adding a partial range. So, total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49? Wait, no, because in the hundreds place, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can be 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, the 8's come from:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place 8's:49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. The difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units:49, correct because from 4,14,...484, which is 484=4+10*(n-1). So, 484=4+10*(n-1)=>n= (484-4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49.\n\n- Tens:50, correct because 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 50.\n\n- Hundreds:89, correct because 400-488 is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49, correct because 8,18,...488. The last term is 488=8+10*(n-1)=>n=(488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49.\n\n- Tens:49, as calculated earlier.\n\n- Hundreds:0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences (no page numbers 800+).\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last one with a 4 in the units place. How many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, I think it's 48 full cycles of 10, and then the remaining 8 numbers (481-488). In each full cycle, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), does 484 fall into this? Yes, because 484 is within 481-488. So, that's another 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? Let's see, from 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, which means 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. In each hundred, the 40-49 block contributes 10 numbers. So, 4 blocks would give 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, in the last partial hundred (401-488), does the 440-449 block exist? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's another 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 4 * 10 + 10 = 50. Wait, that can't be right because 4 blocks would be 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each has a 40-49 block, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, 401-488 includes 440-449, which is another 10. So, total 50. Hmm, that seems correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place only in the numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 89. So, total hundreds place 4's: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 = 99, and 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, in each cycle of 10, one 8 in the units place. So, 48 full cycles would give 48 8's, but since 488 is included, that's 49th occurrence. Wait, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so yes, 49. So, units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100, specifically 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with an 8 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the blocks are: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last page). So, the first four blocks each contribute 10, and the last block contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

    "text": " So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. Let me calculate that: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra numbers. Since 488 is the last number, the 48th group ends at 480, and then we have 481 to 488. In each group of 10, the units digit is 4 exactly once. So, 48 times. But wait, in the 48th group, which is 480-489, but our book only goes up to 488, so the units digit 4 in 484 is still within the range. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place (second digit):** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range, but 480-489 isn't fully included because we stop at 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see: Each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) has a 40-49 block. So, from 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). Similarly, 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). But wait, in the last block, 400-488, the 40-49 in the tens place would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, each hundred block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. How many hundred blocks do we have? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. That's 5 blocks. So, 5 times 10 is 50. Wait, but the last block, 400-488, does it include the 440-449? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place (third digit):** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's. The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, which ends with 8, so that's included. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But our book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's see: Each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) has an 80-89 block. So, 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in this block, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers instead of 10. So, for the first four blocks, each contributes 10, and the last block contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, the digit 8 appears 97 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 97 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For 8's: units 48, tens 49, hundreds 0. 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. In the 400-488 block, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, so 49. That seems right. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I feel like maybe I missed something. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For the tens place of 4's, I had 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Units place, 48. So, 48+50+89=187. For 8's, units 48, tens 49, so 97. 187-97=90. I think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me see how many times that happens. The first occurrence is at 4, and the last one in the units place would be 484, which is 484 = 400 + 84, so the units digit is 4. To find how many such numbers there are, I can consider the range from 1 to 488. Since every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place, the total number of 4's in the units place is the number of complete blocks of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 is the last page, so in the last block (480-488), the units digit 4 occurs at 484, which is within this block. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48. Wait, no, that's not right. Because 488 is the last page, so when I divide 488 by 10, I get 48.8, but the number of complete tens is 48, but the last partial block is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, because each full block of 10 contributes one 4, and the last block doesn't add another 4 because 484 is the only one in that block. Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, in each block of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place, regardless of how many numbers are in the last block. So, from 1 to 488, there are 48 full blocks of 10 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks), each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Additionally, in the last partial block (480-488), does the units digit 4 occur? Yes, at 484. So that's an extra 4, making it 49. Wait, but when I count from 1 to 488, the number of times the units digit is 4 is actually equal to the number of times 4 appears in the units place, which is once every 10 numbers. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4, and then in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 484 is the only one with a units digit of 4. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. Let me check with a smaller number to see if my method is correct. For example, if the book had 14 pages, how many 4's in the units place? Pages 4 and 14, so two 4's. Using the same method: 14 \u00f7 10 = 1.4, so 1 full block, contributing one 4, and in the remaining 4 pages (11-14), 14 has a 4 in the units place. So, total 1 + 1 = 2, which is correct. So, applying that to 488, it's 48 full blocks, each giving one 4, and the last partial block (480-488) has one more 4 at 484. So, units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-488 is beyond that. So, each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Therefore, the total number of 4's is the sum of units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. So, 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, but let's check. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, starting at 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8. In the last partial block (480-488), 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since our book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, let's count how many full ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 full ranges \u00d7 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Therefore, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but let me think again. When counting the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, correct. For 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 4 full tens ranges (80-89, etc.) each with 10, plus 9, totaling 49. Units place for 8's: 488 is included, so 49. So, yes, 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (4, 14, 24, ..., 484):**\n   - There are 49 occurrences (48 full decades + 1 in the last partial decade).\n\n2. **Tens Place (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449):**\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges, totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place (400-488):**\n   - From 400 to 488, there are 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (8, 18, 28, ..., 488):**\n   - There are 49 occurrences (48 full decades + 1 in the last partial decade).\n\n2. **Tens Place (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488):**\n   - Four full ranges contribute 40, and the partial range 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 488 by 10 and take the integer part. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10, meaning 48 times 4 appears in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last group is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, does that affect the count? Let me see: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8). So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one block, so 10 times. From 100-199: 140-149 is another, 10 times. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10 times. 300-399: 340-349, 10 times. 400-488: 440-449, which is another 10 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 times, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? Let me subtract: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. Wait, 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187? Wait, no, 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. Hmm, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 48 times. Tens place: 50 times. Hundreds place: 89 times. So, 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, meaning 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 80-89 is one block, 10 times. From 100-199: 180-189, 10 times. 200-299: 280-289, 10 times. 300-399: 380-389, 10 times. 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, 480-488 is part of this. So, from 480-488, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? 480, 481, ..., 488: that's 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive). So, instead of 10, it's 9. So, for the hundreds place in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0. So, total number of 8's is units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me just double-check my calculations. For 4's: Units: 48, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. For 8's: Units: 48, Tens: 49, Hundreds: 0. 48 + 49 = 97. 187 - 97 = 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " How many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see, every 10 numbers, there's one 4. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? The last number is 488, which ends with an 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484. So, from 4,14,...,484, that's 49 times? Wait, let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49.

Wait, let me think. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is in the first 100 numbers. Then, in 140-149, which is in the second 100. Similarly, 240-249 in the third 100, and 340-349 in the fourth 100. Now, 440-449 would be in the fifth 100, but since the book only goes up to 488, 440-449 is still within 488. So, how many blocks? Let's see: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall entirely within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4. That would be numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in terms of the hundreds digit being 4, each number from 400-488 has a hundreds digit of 4. So, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? Let's see, starting at 8, ending at 488. The last number is 488, which ends with 8. So, the sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The common difference is 10. Number of terms: ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. So, numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, we have four blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). Now, 480-489 would be the next block, but since we only go up to 488, 480-488 has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Wait, let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them (480,481,...,488). So, how many numbers? From 480-488, that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus the 9 numbers from 480-488. So, 40 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488. The hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800 or above, but since the book ends at 488, there are no page numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the Digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units Place (4, 14, 24, ..., 484):**\n   - Number of terms: 49\n\n2. **Tens Place (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449):**\n   - Each block of 100 contributes 10 numbers.\n   - Total blocks: 5\n   - Total count: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50\n\n3. **Hundreds Place (400-488):**\n   - Numbers from 400 to 488: 89\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the Digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units Place (8, 18, 28, ..., 488):**\n   - Number of terms: 49\n\n2. **Tens Place (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488):**\n   - Each block of 100 contributes 10 numbers for the first four blocks.\n   - Fifth block (480-488): 9 numbers\n   - Total count: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total count: 0\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me see how many such numbers there are. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the total number of page numbers divided by 10, but since 488 isn't a multiple of 10, I'll take the integer part. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times. Wait, but let me check: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles of 10, which gives 48 instances where the units digit is 4. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is within 488. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the 40s, 140s, 240s, 340s, and 440s. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50 times. Wait, but wait: 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This happens from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, meaning 48 times. But wait, the last page is 488, which ends with an 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, because 488 is included, so it's 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then an additional 8 in 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but let me check: 8, 18, ..., 488. The first 8 is at 8, and the last is at 488, which is the 49th term because (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This happens in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's see how many ranges there are. From 0 to 488, the tens digit is 8 in the 80s, 180s, 280s, 380s, and 480s. That's 5 ranges. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, but the last range, 480-488, has only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, for the first four ranges, 4 x 10 = 40, and the last range contributes 9. So total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, no, wait: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So that's 4 x 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This would happen from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, 484 is the last one because 484 + 10 = 494, which is beyond 488. So, how many such numbers are there? Let me calculate: The first number with 4 in the units place is 4, and the last is 484. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term a1 = 4, common difference d = 10. The nth term is given by a_n = a1 + (n-1)d. Let's set a_n = 484: 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 480 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but 484 is the 49th term, so that's correct. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many numbers in each hundred have 4 in the tens place. From 1-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449 each contribute 10 numbers. Now, let's check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488. So, how many hundreds do we have? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, that's 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50. Wait, but wait a second. The last set is 400-488, so 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, total 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me double-check. Wait, when counting the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's indeed 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. Now, moving on to counting the number of 8's. Let's do the same approach for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many terms are there. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is an arithmetic sequence with a1=8, d=10. The nth term is a_n = 8 + (n-1)*10. Set a_n = 488: 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 480 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n=49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 8 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within 488. Yes, up to 488. So, how many hundreds have 8 in the tens place? From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is another 10. Similarly, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488 (since 488 is the last page). Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is included). So, wait, let me correct that. For the hundreds place, 400-488, the tens place 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, how many sets do we have? From 0-99: 80-89 (10). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488 (9). So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, that's 49 occurrences. Hmm, let me check that again. So, 0-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, and 400-488:9. So, 10*4 +9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, there are 0 occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's was 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, earlier when I calculated the number of 4's, I got 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Let me check the tens place again for 4's. I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. Now, for 8's, the units place was 49, which is correct because from 8 to 488, every 10th number has an 8 in the units place, and 488 is the last one, so 49 terms. For the tens place, I had 49, which comes from 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct because in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, 49 in the tens place for 8's. So, total 8's: 49+49=98. So, 4's:188, 8's:98, difference is 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because the hundreds place for 4's adds 89, which is a lot. Let me check that again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct because 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, yes, that's correct. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484. This gives 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** From 400 to 488, there are 89 numbers with 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8 to 488.

The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** Since the book only has 488 pages, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me figure out how many times this happens. The first occurrence is 4, and the last is 484. To find the total number of times 4 appears in the units place, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence. The common difference here is 10. So, the first term a1 is 4, and the last term an is 484. The formula is an = a1 + (n-1)d, where d is the common difference. Plugging in the numbers: 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 4 from both sides: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide both sides by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but does 484 actually exist? Yes, because 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49, that's the first set. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 occurrences. But wait, the last page is 488, so 440-449 is within the book, right? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 here. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? Let's subtract 399 from 488 to get the count. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 occurrences. Wait, is that right? Let me check: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, and adding 1 gives 89. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many times this happens. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. Using the same arithmetic sequence formula: an = a1 + (n-1)d. 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 8: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n = 49. So, 49 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such ranges there are. Starting from 80-89, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 sets. Each set has 10 numbers, so 4*10 = 40 occurrences. Wait, but does 480-489 exist? Since the book only goes up to 488, the range 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, the tens digit in 480-488 is 8, but it's only 9 numbers, not 10. So, for the tens place, the first three sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 numbers, and the last partial set (480-488) has 9 numbers. So, total tens place occurrences are 4*10 + 9 = 49? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the 480-488 is the fifth set if we consider each hundred. Wait, no, let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488. So, the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many full sets of 80-89, 180-189, etc., are there? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 full sets and 1 partial set. So, total tens place occurrences are 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's are printed than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

There are 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since page numbers don't reach 800.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, how many such numbers are there from 1 to 488? Well, every 10 numbers, there's one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place would be the total number of tens in 488. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but we can only have whole tens, so that's 48 times. But wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 times, but actually, when we reach 480, 481, etc., up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488), so the last set of units digits is 0-8, so 484 is included. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many such sets there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one set of 10 numbers, so that's 10 times. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10 times. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 times. So, 5 x 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but let me check: the last number is 488, which ends with 8, so that's included. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such sets there are. From 1-99: 80-89 is one set, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. Now, from 400-488: The next set would be 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. Wait, but in the tens place, 80-89, etc., so in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, how many 8's? Each set of 10 contributes 10 8's in the tens place, but the last set (480-488) only contributes 9. So, from 1-399, we have 4 sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10, so 4 x 10 = 40. Then, from 400-488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero 8's in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 97 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Checking 4's: Units place: 48 times. Tens place: 50 times. Hundreds place: 89 times. Total: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct. Now for 8's: Units place: 48 times. Tens place: 49 times. Hundreds place: 0. Total: 48 + 49 = 97. So, 187 - 97 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the units place again for 4's. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? The last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1 = 48, so n=49. Wait, that's 49 times, not 48. Oh no, I think I made a mistake here. Because 484 is the 49th term. Let me recount: From 4 to 484, how many numbers? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, the number of terms is floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1 = (484)/10 +1 = 48.4 +1, but that's not right. Alternatively, the formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place for 4's is 49 times, not 48. That changes things. So, earlier, I thought 48, but it's actually 49. Let me adjust that. So, units place for 4's: 49. Tens place: 50. Hundreds place: 89. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 +89= 188. Now, for 8's: Units place: 48. Tens place: Let's see, from 1-399, we have 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389: 4 sets, each 10 numbers, so 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 +9=49. So, total 8's: 48+49=97. So, now, the difference is 188 -97=91. Wait, so earlier I thought 90, but now it's 91. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me recount the hundreds place. Hundreds place for 4's: numbers from 400 to 488. That's 488 - 400 +1=89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times. So that's correct. So, 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. 8's: units 48, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 97. So, 188-97=91. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but earlier I thought 90, but after correcting the units place, it's 91. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Let me see: Tens place for 4's: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 5x10=50. Correct. So, 50 in tens place. So, 49+50+89=188. 8's: 48+49=97. So, 188-97=91. So, the correct answer is 91.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the number of '4's:**\n1. **Units place:** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Let me figure out how many such numbers there are. The first number with 4 in the units place is 4, and the last one before 488 is 484. To find how many numbers there are, I can calculate (484 - 4)/10 + 1. That's (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. Wait, but wait a minute, 488 is the last page. So, 484 is indeed the last one, so 49 is correct. 2. **Tens place:** Now, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many full hundreds we have. The book goes up to 488, so the hundreds digits go up to 4. So, the ranges would be 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but wait, let me check. 440-449 is 10 numbers, yes, and each of the others is also 10. So, 5 ranges, so 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but wait, the hundreds digit is 4 only in 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is included. So, let me calculate how many such numbers. The first is 8, last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. Wait, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So, 49 is correct. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, let me count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 plus 9 is 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only from page 800 onwards, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, but wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total:98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, correct. And for 8's in the tens place, I had 49. Let me check that again: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49, correct. So, yes, 98 8's. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 48*10 is 480, so from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so no extra 4 in the units place beyond the 48 cycles. So, 48 times. But wait, let me check: the first 4 is at 4, then every 10 after that. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? The last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Wait, so that's 49 times. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which suggests that the 49th occurrence would be at 484, which is within 488. So, actually, it's 49 times. Okay, so units place: 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). 100-199: 140-149 (10). 200-299: 240-249 (10). 300-399: 340-349 (10). 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. That's 5*10=50. So, tens place: 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This happens from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me think: 400 is the first, 401, 402,... up to 488. So, yes, 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many terms there are. The last term is 488, which is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, (488-8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens digit in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, let's see how many full blocks and partial blocks we have. Each full block (like 80-89) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights: 4*10=40. Now, the last block is 480-488. How many numbers here have 8 in the tens place? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 in all these, so that's 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights =90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 4, and the last one before 488 would be 484. To find how many, I can use the formula: ((last - first) / interval) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 484 is the 49th term? Let me check. From 4 to 484, that's 480 numbers, divided by 10 gives 48 intervals, so 49 numbers. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on. So, 40-49 is one block, 140-149 is another, 240-249 is another, 340-349 is another, and 440-449 is another. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4 in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, I need to count how many times 8 appears. Let me do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The interval is 10, so ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me check if 480-489 is included, but since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, how many blocks are there? 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me think again. From 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9. So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8 in each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=49+49=98. Difference=188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. I think I did everything correctly.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in any hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " How many such numbers are there? Well, starting from 4 and adding 10 each time until I reach 484. To find the total count, I can divide 484 by 10, which gives 48.4, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 484 count? Let me check: 484 is indeed within the 488-page limit, so yes, it's included. So, that's 48 times. But wait, let me think again. From 4 to 484, how many numbers? The first number is 4, which is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. Wait, that's 49 numbers. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because when you start counting from 4, the next is 14, which is 4 + 10*1, then 24, which is 4 + 10*2, and so on until 484, which is 4 + 10*48. So that's 49 numbers in total. So, in the units place, 4 appears 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so that's 5 ranges * 10 = 50 numbers. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, in the hundreds place, only the digit 4 is considered, so each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Now, adding up the counts for each place: Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. Total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, but 488 is included. So, starting from 8, adding 10 each time: 8,18,28,...,488. The count would be (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 4 ranges *10=40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So total in tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up the counts: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total 8's=49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, how many times does this happen? Well, from 1 to 488, every block of 10 numbers has one 4 in the units place. So, how many such blocks are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 488 include an extra 4 in the units place? Let me check: 484 is the last one before 488, so yes, 48 times. So, 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? Let's see. The first block is 40-49, which is one block. Then, in the hundreds place, we have 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is the last block. So, how many blocks with 4 in the tens place? Let's count. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, right? So, that's another block. So, total blocks with 4 in the tens place: 1 (40-49) + 1 (140-149) + 1 (240-249) + 1 (340-349) + 1 (440-449) = 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's, so 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 4's. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. How many numbers is that? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, does 488 include an extra 8? Let's see: 488 is the last page, so yes, 8 appears in the units place in 488. So, 48 +1? Wait, no. Wait, from 1 to 488, the number of 8's in the units place is the number of times 8 appears as the last digit. So, every 10 numbers, there's one 8. So, total number is floor(488 / 10) = 48, but since 488 ends with 8, we add 1 more. So, 48 +1 = 49. Wait, but let me check: from 1-10: 8 is once. 11-20: 18, once. ... 481-490: 488 is included, so that's the 49th time. So, yes, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 can appear in the tens place, like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 80-89 is one block. From 100-199: 180-189 is another. Similarly, 280-289 and 380-389. Now, 400-488: does 480-489 fall within 488? 480-489 is within 488, but 488 is the last page. So, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block, but we only go up to 488. So, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place in 400-488? It's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's less than a full block. So, let's count the full blocks first. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. Now, 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and 9 numbers in 480-488. So, 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block, which is 10 numbers, but we only have 9 because the book ends at 488. So, 4 full blocks and 9 numbers. So, total 4*10 +9=49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 can appear in the hundreds place. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3, or 4. 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 187, number of 8's is 98. So, 187 -98=89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's: units place: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98+89=187. That seems correct. Now, 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, so the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me think again about the tens place for 4's. I had 5 blocks of 10 numbers each with 4 in the tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10 4's, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. And the hundreds place: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Units place: 48, as 488/10=48.8, so 48 full times, plus 488 is included, but 488 is 4 in the hundreds and tens, so units is 8. Wait, but in the units place, 4 appears every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. 484 is the last one with 4 in the units place before 488. So, 48 times. So, 48 is correct. So, 48+50+89=187. For 8's: units place: 49, because 488 is included, so 488 has an 8 in the units place, making it 49. Tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and 9 numbers in 480-488, so 4*10+9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check again the tens place for 8's. From 400-488, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? It's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's correct. So, total 49 in the tens place. Units place:49, tens:49, so 98 total. So, 187-98=89. Yeah, I think that's correct. So, the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of 4's: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 4's, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Number of 4's: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in page numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of 4's: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total number of 4's:** \\( 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of 8's: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and partially in 480-488.\n   - Full blocks contribute \\( 4 \\times 10 = 40 \\) 8's.\n   - Partial block (480-488) contributes 9 8's.\n   - Number of 8's: \\( 40 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n   - Number of 8's: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's minus number of 8's: \\( 187 - 98 = 89 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " How many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 48*10 is 480, and then from 481 to 488, there's another 4 in 484. So, that's 49 times. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page. Let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10, so for each 10 numbers, there's one 4. So, from 1 to 480, that's 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of 10, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, we have 484 as the only number with a 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48 +1=49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? Let's count how many such sets there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one set, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 times the 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. That's 488-400+1=89 numbers. Wait, no, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +50 +89. Let me add them up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. Then, from 481-488, the next 8 would be in 488, so that's another 1. So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers every 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 480-489? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, let's see: from 1-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (from 1-399) and one set of 9 (from 400-488). So, 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10, contributing 48 occurrences. Additionally, 484 adds one more, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in sets like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 5 sets of 10, contributing 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences (48 full sets plus one in 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in sets like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last set (480-488) contributing 9 occurrences, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " How many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one number ending with 4. So, how many blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block from 481 to 488. In each block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, in the partial block from 481 to 488, does 484 fall into this? Yes, 484 is within 481-488, so that's another 4. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, no, because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, it's 48 full blocks (1-480) and then 481-488. In each of the 48 blocks, there's one 4, so 48 times. Then in 481-488, 484 is the only number ending with 4, so that's one more. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens digit. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the blocks are: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's five blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, so all five blocks are valid. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, but I'm only counting the hundreds place here, so each number contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, total 4's in the hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 48 full blocks (1-480) with one 4 each, so 48. Then 481-488 has 484, so one more, total 49. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each with 10, so 5\u00d710=50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4, so 89. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the partial block 481-488, 488 is included, which is an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let's count the blocks: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), but since we're looking at the tens digit being 8, each number from 480 to 488 has 8 in the tens place. Wait, no: 480 is 4-8-0, so tens digit is 8. 481 is 4-8-1, tens digit 8, and so on up to 488, which is 4-8-8. So, that's 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks are 10 each, and the last block is 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full decades (1-480) and one partial decade (481-488). The total is 48 + 1 = 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers.

Total is 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, in every block of 10 numbers, it appears once. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 blocks of 10, which gives 48 occurrences. But wait, 488 is the last page, so from 481 to 488, that's 8 more numbers, and in that, the units place goes from 1 to 8, so no 4 in the units place there. So, total units place 4's: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5*10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Yes, and 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4, so that's 89 occurrences. So, hundreds place 4's: 89. Now, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that's 48 full tens, giving 48 occurrences. But wait, 488 is the last page, so in the last block (480-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no. Wait, 488 is the last page, so from 1 to 488, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48 times, but since 488 ends with 8, that's an extra occurrence. So, 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). Now, from 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of this. So, in the tens place, 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so that's 9 occurrences. So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges of 10 each (80-89, etc.) plus 9 in 480-488. So, 4*10 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but 80-89 is in 0-99, which is 10 numbers, same for 180-189, etc. So, 4 ranges each contributing 10, that's 40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49. So, tens place 8's: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98. Now, the number of 4's was 187, and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have miscounted. Let me recount the 4's: units place: 48, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 48 + 50 = 98, +89 = 187. That seems correct. For the 8's: units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds: 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because 89 seems like a big difference. Let me think again about the tens place for 4's. From 40-49, that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. For the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. Units place: every 10 numbers, so 48 full tens, and then in 488, the units digit is 8, so no extra 4 in the units place beyond 480. Wait, 488 is 488, so the units digit is 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is within 480-488. So, units place 4's: 48. So, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. For the 8's: units place: 49, tens place: 49. So, 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Total occurrences: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups of 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups plus 1 for 488).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, totaling 40.

    "text": " So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Let's see, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one number ending with 4. So, from 1 to 488, there are 488 / 10 = 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 488 is the last page. Let me check: 484 is the last number ending with 4 before 488, so that's 48 numbers (4, 14, 24, ..., 484). So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? From 1-99: 40-49 is one block, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 times in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's are 187. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, but wait, 488 is included. Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, the last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. Wait, but 488 is the 49th number? Wait, 8 is the 1st, 18 the 2nd, ..., 488 would be the 49th. Because from 8 to 488, the difference is 480, which divided by 10 is 48, so 48 +1 = 49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, how many blocks? From 1-99: 80-89, that's 10. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. Now, from 400-488, does 480-489 fall within 488? 480-489 would be pages 480 to 489, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, for the tens place, we have 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, and then 480-488 contributing 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units place: 48, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. Total: 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. That seems correct. For 8's: units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. Total: 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, but let me think again about the 8's in the tens place. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's correct, 9 instead of 10. So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, totaling 49 in the tens place. Units place: 49, as 488 is included. So, 49 + 49 = 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 48 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Total blocks: 5 (each contributing 10 numbers).\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., and in 480-488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- More 4's than 8's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"
