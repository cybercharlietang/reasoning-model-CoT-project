    "text": " Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last page with a 4 in the units place would be 484. Let me see how many times 4 appears in the units place. The pattern repeats every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 times. But wait, in the 480-488 range, the units place goes from 0 to 8, so 484 is included, which is the 48th group. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 488. Let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each hundred has a set of ten numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 1-99, it's 40-49: 10 numbers. From 100-199, it's 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249: 10. 300-399: 340-349: 10. 400-488: 440-449: 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 times. Hmm, but wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 only once per number. So, from 400 to 488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Wait, but 400 to 488 is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89). So, that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89 = let me add that up. 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. Let me see how many times 8 appears in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many groups of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last number, so in the 480-488 range, the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included, which is the 48th group. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the hundreds place as well, but I'm only considering the tens place here. So, each hundred has a set of ten numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189: 10. 200-299: 280-289: 10. 300-399: 380-389: 10. 400-488: 480-488: how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, that's 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, because 480-488 is only 9 numbers, not 10, since 488 is the last page. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 49 + 0 = 97 times. Wait, let me check that again. Units place: 48 times. Tens place: 49 times. Hundreds place: 0. So, 48 + 49 = 97. So, 97 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place: 48, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. That seems correct. For 8's: units place: 48, tens: 49, hundreds: 0. 48 + 49 = 97. So, 187 - 97 = 90. Hmm, that seems right. But let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? So, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, so 9 times the tens digit is 8. So, in the tens place, 49 times total. So, yes, 49. So, 48 + 49 = 97. So, 187 - 97 = 90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but I just thought of something. When counting the hundreds place for 4's, I included 400-488 as 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. But when counting the tens place for 8's, I included 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by considering each digit position separately and counting the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each position across all page numbers from 1 to 488. Let me try that method to cross-verify. For the units place: For each digit, 0-9, each digit appears equally often in the units place, except possibly the last group if the total number isn't a multiple of 10. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. The number of complete groups of 10 is 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8). Each group contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, units place: 48 times each. But wait, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 +1 = 49 times for 4? Wait, no, because from 1 to 480, it's 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 4's: 48 +1 = 49, 8's: 48 +1 = 49. Wait, but earlier I thought units place for 4's was 48. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify. If I consider that from 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers, which is 48 groups of 10. Each group contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times each. Then, from 481 to 488, that's 8 numbers: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 4's: 48 +1 = 49, 8's: 48 +1 = 49. So, that's 49 each. Wait, but earlier I thought units place for 4's was 48. So, I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. So, units place for 4's: 49 times, 8's: 49 times. Now, moving to the tens place. For the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred. So, in the tens place, for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. From 1-400, how many hundreds do we have? 4 hundreds: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so the tens digit in 400-488 goes up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for the tens place: 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers except maybe the last one if it's cut off. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, 5 sets, each contributing 10 times, so 50 times for 4's in the tens place. Similarly, 8's in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these is 10 numbers except the last one, which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, so 4*10 +9=49 times for 8's in the tens place. So, tens place: 4's:50, 8's:49. Now, hundreds place: 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. 8's in the hundreds place: since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0 times. So, hundreds place: 4's:89, 8's:0. Now, let's sum it all up.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49+0=98\n\nWait, so now I'm getting 188 4's and 98 8's, which would mean 188-98=90 more 4's. But wait, earlier I thought units place for 4's was 49, but in my initial calculation, I had 48. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's clarify. From 1-480, units digit cycles 48 times, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, from 481-488, units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place for 4's:48+1=49, 8's:48+1=49. So, that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's, it's 50 times, and for 8's, it's 49 times.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so that's the same as before. So, I think my initial calculation was correct, and the confusion was just in the recounting. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but in my first approach, I thought units place for 4's was 48, but after recounting, it's 49. So, that's where the confusion came from. But after correcting, it's 49 for both 4's and 8's in the units place, leading to 188 4's and 98 8's, difference of 90.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position.\n\nFor a given digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated as:\n\nunits = (N // 10) * 1 + min(max(N % 10 - d + 1, 0), 10 - d)\n\nWait, maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, for each position, calculate how many times each digit appears.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to stick with the method I used, which seems to give me 90 as the difference.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's list out the counts again.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal:188\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal:98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about how many times each digit appears in each position up to 488.\n\nFor units place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears floor(488/10)=48 times, and then the remainder is 8, so digits 1-8 appear one more time. So, for digits 1-8, units place count is 48+1=49, and 9 and 0 are 48 each. So, 4 and 8 each appear 49 times in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred, so for 488, which is 4 hundreds and 88 numbers into the fifth hundred. So, for the tens place, each digit appears 4 times 10=40 times, plus the extra in the partial hundred.\n\nFrom 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is 4-8-8). So, in the tens place, digits 0-8 each appear 10 times up to 479, and then from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480-488). So, digit 8 in the tens place appears 40 +9=49 times, and digits 0-7 appear 40 times each, and digit 9 appears 40 times as well, but since we don't go up to 490, digit 9 in the tens place doesn't appear in the partial hundred.\n\nWait, no, actually, from 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit 0-8, how many times do they appear? For tens digits 0-7, each appears 10 times (e.g., 400-409 for 0, 410-419 for 1, etc.), but 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 times. So, in the tens place, digits 0-7 appear 40 times each (4 times 10), digit 8 appears 40 +9=49 times, and digit 9 appears 40 times (if we had 490-499, but we don't, so digit 9 appears 40 times as well, but since we stop at 488, digit 9 in the tens place doesn't appear in the last partial hundred. Wait, no, 490-499 would be needed for digit 9 to appear, but since we stop at 488, digit 9 in the tens place doesn't appear at all in the 400-488 range. So, digit 9 in the tens place appears 40 times (from 100-399), but not in 400-488. So, total for tens place:\n\nDigits 0-8: each appears 40 times (from 1-399) plus in 400-488, digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, and 8 appears 9 times. So, total for each digit:\n\n- 0: 40 (from 1-399) +10 (400-409) =50\n- 1:40 +10=50\n- 2:40 +10=50\n- 3:40 +10=50\n- 4:40 +10=50\n- 5:40 +10=50\n- 6:40 +10=50\n- 7:40 +10=50\n- 8:40 +9=49\n- 9:40 (from 1-399) +0=40\n\nWait, but this seems conflicting with earlier counts. Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me just focus on digits 4 and 8.\n\nIn the tens place, digit 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers except 440-449, which is within 488, so 10 numbers. So, 5 sets of 10, so 50 times.\n\nDigit 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four sets is 10 numbers, and the last set is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49 times.\n\nSo, that's consistent with earlier counts.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds place:\n\nDigit 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nDigit 8 never appears in the hundreds place, as the book only has 488 pages.\n\nSo, summing up:\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:188\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. There are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each group of 10 numbers contributes one 4.\n   - From 1 to 480, there are 48 complete groups, contributing 48 4's.\n   - From 481 to 488, the units digit 4 appears once (484).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 ranges.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, each group of 10 numbers contributes one 8.\n   - From 1 to 480, 48 8's.\n   - From 481 to 488, the units digit 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, totaling 40.\n   - From 480-488, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, does 484 count? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, there's a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so in the 480-488 range, the units digit 4 appears in 484. So, that's included in the 48 count. Hmm, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is within 480-488, so yes, 48 times. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). 100-199: 140-149 (10). 200-299: 240-249 (10). 300-399: 340-349 (10). 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, let's check the last group: 480-488. The units digit 8 appears in 488, so that's included. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488: the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each block contributes 10 except the last one which contributes 9. Let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 49 + 0 = 97 times.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units:48\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:48+49=97. Correct.\n\nDifference:187-97=90.\n\nYes, that seems right. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10, so 48 times.\n   - **Tens Place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks, each contributing 10 times, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times.\n   - **Tens Place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The last block (480-488) contributes 9 times, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are \\boxed{90} more 4's than 8's printed."

    "text": " Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484. How many times does this happen? Well, from 1 to 488, how many sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is the 49th set, but since 488 is beyond 480, the 488th page would be in the 49th set. But in the units place, the 48th set ends at 480, so 480 has a 0 in the units place, but 484 is in the 48th set. Wait, no, 484 is in the 48th set because 484 is 48*10 + 4. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is within this range, adding another 4. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. From 1-480: 48 sets, each contributing a 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, 484 is the next 4 in the units place, so that's one more, making it 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 4's. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10 = 50 times. But wait, let me make sure. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, so 10 4's. Then from 100-199: 140-149 is another, another 10. 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. Each page number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, total 188 4's. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? From 1 to 488, how many full tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets. Each set contributes one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it's the last page. So, does that mean we have 48 or 49? Wait, let's think. The first set is 1-10: 8 is in 8, so one 8. The second set 11-20: 18, so another 8. So, each set of 10 contributes one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, that's 48 sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 has an 8, which is the 49th occurrence. So, total 49 times in the units place. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49. Alternatively, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, we add 1, making it 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers, so 10 8's. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, in the tens place, we have:\n\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9 =49 times. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, there are 0 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's)=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (including 484).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences (including 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? Let me check. The last number with a 4 in the units place before 488 would be 484. So, how many such numbers are there? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10 each time. So that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, no, actually, if I start at 4, the next is 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 would be beyond 488? No, 440-449 is within 488. Let me check. Each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So from 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, starting from 8, stepping by 10 each time. The last number is 488. So, how many terms? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, let's see: each hundred block has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So from 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me see: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, there's one 4. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets of 10, and then 8 extra numbers. In each set of 10, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so there's one more 4 (484). So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the ranges are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so that's one more 8 (488). So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times. - 180-189: 10 times. - 280-289: 10 times. - 380-389: 10 times. - 480-488: 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 times. So, total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in page numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

    "text": " Let me see, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place. Since every 10 numbers contribute one 4, I can calculate how many tens there are in 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full tens and then 8 more numbers. So, in each ten, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, the 49th ten would be 490-499, but since we only go up to 488, the 490-499 range isn't included. So, maybe it's 48 times. But wait, let's check the last few numbers. The last number with a 4 in the units place before 488 would be 484, right? So, 484 is the 48th occurrence. So, units place gives us 48 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see: 40-49 is the first block, which is within 1-99. Then, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's included. So, 50 fours from the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me check: 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens. So, 48 eights. But wait, let's check the last number: 488 ends with 8, so that's the 48th occurrence. So, 48 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 in the tens place. This happens in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 eights in the tens place, but the last block, 480-488, is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 from the last block, so 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so that's 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this book. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place anywhere from 1 to 488. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 187, number of 8's is 97. The difference is 187 - 97 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. For 8's: units 48, tens 49, hundreds 0. 48 + 49 is 97. 187 - 97 is indeed 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - There are 48 such occurrences (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - There are 5 such blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n\nTotal 4's = 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - There are 48 such occurrences (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 40 occurrences, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 48 (units) + 49 (tens) = 97.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 187 - 97 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490), but since we stop at 488, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, does that mean the 48th group ends at 480, and then we have 481-488. So, the units digit 4 occurs 48 times? Wait, but 488 is the last page, so in the units place, 4 appears in 4,14,24,...,484. Let's check: 484 is within 488, so how many terms are there? The first term is 4, the last term is 484, and the common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Oh, so actually, it's 49 times. I think I made a mistake earlier. So, the units place has 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 fours. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 fours. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 fours. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 fours. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place, which is the third digit. This happens from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours printed. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many times that is. The first term is 8, the last term is 488, common difference 10. Number of terms = ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Each full range (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one which is incomplete. Let's count: From 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 eights. From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 eights. From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 eights. From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 eights. From 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 eights (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, but wait, 480-489 would be 10, but we stop at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers). So, the first four ranges contribute 4\u00d710=40 eights, and the last range contributes 9 eights. So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights printed. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit):** The digit 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such ranges, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit):** The digit 4 appears from page 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit):** The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each full range contributes 10, with the last range (480-488) contributing 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit):** The digit 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.  \nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit 4 would go up to 484, right? Let me calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. From 1 to 488, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of blocks is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a block, we take the integer part, which is 48 blocks. Each block contributes one 4, so that's 48 times. However, wait, in the last block, which is 481-490, but our book ends at 488, so actually, the last block is only up to 488. So, in the units place, from 1 to 480, we have 48 times, and then from 481 to 488, the units digit 4 occurs once more at 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Actually, from 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers, which is 48 blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then from 481 to 488, that's 8 numbers: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The units digit 4 occurs only once at 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many full hundreds we have. From 1-488, we have four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 occurs in the 40-49 range, which is 10 times. So, for each of the first four hundreds (1-400), that's 4 times 10, which is 40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10 times. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's another 10. So, total 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, which is 89 times. Now, let me add up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's the same calculation as for 4's. So, 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, from 481-488, the units digit 8 occurs once at 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full hundred (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has one range where the tens digit is 8, contributing 10 occurrences. So, from 1-400, we have four hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit is 8 for all these, which is 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades plus one additional 4 at 484, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, and with five such ranges (including 440-449), we get 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, contributing 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears 48 times in full decades plus one at 488, totaling 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, and with four full ranges plus 9 occurrences in 480-488, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in 1-488, contributing 0.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit 4 would go up to 484, right? Let me see: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks. Each block contributes one 4, so that's 48 times. But wait, the last block is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, does that affect the count? Hmm, in the units place, 488 would have 8 in the units, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484. So, yes, 48 times for the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one range, contributing 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another, 10 numbers. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 ranges in total, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times for the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. That would be pages 400-488. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times for the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Each block of 10 has one 8, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8. But wait, the last block is 481-490, but we only go up to 488, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, that's 48 times? Wait, 488 is included, so does that mean 49 times? Wait, let me think again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each 10, there's an 8 in the units place. How many 10s are there in 488? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, which would give 48 eights. But wait, the 48th ten would end at 480, right? Then, from 481 to 488, the next numbers would be 481, 482, ..., 488. So, in the 49th ten, which is 481-490, we have 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that would be the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the tens place. That would be in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 80-89 is one range, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. Similarly, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 ranges. Now, each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98.

    "text": " Wait, does 488 have a 4 in the units place? Let me check: 488 ends with 8, so the units digit is 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be at 484. So, how many 4's are there in the units place? Well, from 1 to 488, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of blocks of 10 is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a block, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 48 times 10 is 480, so from 1 to 480, there are 48 4's in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is within this range, adding one more 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in the following decades: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these decades has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 5 decades, each contributing 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, 5 decades \u00d7 10 = 50 numbers. However, each of these contributes one 4 in the tens place, so 50 4's. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, the count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see: the last number is 488, which ends with 8. So, the number of 8's in the units place is the same as the number of 4's in the units place, which is 49. Wait, but let me confirm. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place, so 48 full decades (1-480) give 48 8's, and then from 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 adds another 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8. This happens in decades like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last decade is 480-488. Let's count how many full decades: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, that's 4 decades \u00d7 10 = 40 numbers. Now, the next decade would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, how many 8's do we have here? Each of these 9 numbers has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 more 8's. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but since the book is only 488 pages, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the 4's: units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - From 1 to 480: 48 occurrences.\n   - From 481 to 488: 1 occurrence (484).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in decades like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - There are 5 such decades (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Each decade contributes 10 numbers, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - From 1 to 480: 48 occurrences.\n   - From 481 to 488: 1 occurrence (488).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in decades like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Full decades: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 \u2192 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Partial decade: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (max page is 488).\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, does 488 count? No, because 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, let me see how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. The pattern is every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? Let's see, the first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10, so the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is okay, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, but since we're only going up to 488, 480-488 is part of it. Wait, no, I'm considering the tens place, so 4 in the tens place would be 40-49, 140-149, etc. Let's count how many full groups of 100 there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. From 200-299: 240-249 is another 10. From 300-399: 340-349 is another 10. From 400-488: 440-449 is another 10, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50. Wait, but wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place, which is from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Wait, but each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Wait, but wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is included, so let's see how many terms. The first term is 8, last term is 488. Common difference is 10. Number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, let's count how many full groups: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the 800-899 range, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4,14,24,...,484 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449 \u2192 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8,18,28,...,488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488 \u2192 4 sets of 10 and 9 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488 \u2192 0 times.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, let me think. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, there's one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers, which would be 48 sets of 10, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units place goes from 1 to 8, so no additional 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place (second digit):** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's another block. So, how many blocks? 0-99: 1 block, 100-199: 1, 200-299:1, 300-399:1, 400-488:1. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place (third digit):** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? Let's see, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 page numbers. So, total 4's in hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets of 10, so 48 times. But wait, let me check: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but the last set is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the 48th set would be 481-490, but 488 is the last page. So, actually, the units digit cycles 48 full times, and the 49th set would be 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the units digit 8 appears once more in 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times? Wait, no, that's not right. Because from 1-480, it's 48 times, and then 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is the 488th page, so the units digit 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 478, 488. Let's count how many that is. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. The number of terms in this sequence is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place (second digit):** Now, 8 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is one block, contributing 10 8's in the tens place. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the 400-488 range. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (from 0-399) plus 9 in 400-488. So, 4 * 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 0-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place (third digit):** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the units place. I thought initially it was 49, but let me recount. The units digit 8 occurs at 8,18,28,...,478,488. So, how many terms are there? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, correct, 49 times in units place. Similarly, in the tens place, we have 49 times. So total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's was 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10, contributing 48 occurrences.  \n   Total in units place: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place (second digit):**  \n   4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), each contributing 10 occurrences.  \n   Total in tens place: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (third digit):**  \n   4 appears in page numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers.  \n   Total in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Let me see how many times that happens. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Well, the first number is 4, then 14, 24, ..., up to 484. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find how many terms there are, I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_1 is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms. Here, a_1 = 4, d = 10, and a_n = 484. Plugging in: 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 480 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, in the 40-49 range, each number has a 4 in the tens place, so that's 10 numbers. Similarly, in 140-149, another 10 numbers, and so on. Let's see how many such blocks exist up to 488. The blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 occurrences. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. Wait, does 440-449 end at 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many terms there are. The last term is 488. Using the same formula: a_n = 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, 488 - 8 = 480, which is (n-1)*10, so n-1 = 48, so n=49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the block. Let's see how many full blocks there are. Each full block (like 80-89) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But 480-489 is beyond 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, the first four blocks are full (each 10 numbers), and the last one is partial. So, number of 8's in tens place: 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus the partial block from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), each having 8 in the tens place. So, 40 + 9 = 49 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers) From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers) From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers) From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers) Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98+89=187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last cycle is 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so the units place 8's are 8,18,...,488. How many? Let's see, the first 8 is 8, and the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Wait, but earlier I thought 48, but here it's 49. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check. For 4's in units place, from 1-488, the last 4 is 484, which is the 48th occurrence because 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4. But for 8's, the last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. So, units place 8's: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except possibly the last one if it's cut short. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers 180-189: 10 numbers 280-289: 10 numbers 380-389: 10 numbers 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 488-480=8, but inclusive, so 9 numbers. So, the first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 80-89: 10 numbers with 8 in tens place. Similarly, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10 +9=49. So total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Now, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187-98=89. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the 4's: units:48, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 187. 8's: units:49, tens:49, total 98. Difference:187-98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4. Thus, 48 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 5 such ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), contributing 10 each. Thus, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. Thus, 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (since 488 is included).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 full ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributing 10 each, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9. Thus, 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **89**\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Wait, does 488 have a 4 in the units place? No, it ends with 88, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let me see, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, the number of times is the total number of groups of 10 in 488. That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, it's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit cycles every 10. So, from 1 to 480, that's 48 groups of 10, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so no additional 4's in the units place. So, total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit from the right. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's figure out how many such blocks exist up to 488. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, 140-149, another 10. Then 240-249, another 10. Then 340-349, another 10. Then, 440-449, another 10. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times. So, 4's in the tens place: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is the first digit from the right. For page numbers, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 since the book goes up to 488. So, when does 4 appear in the hundreds place? That's from 400 to 488. Now, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many 4's does that contribute? Each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. So, 4's in the hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, total number of 4's is 187. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Well, same as before, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups. Each group contributes one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included. So, does that add an extra 8? Let's see: 488 is the last page, so in the units place, 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, how many times? From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, so 48 times, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10? Wait, no, because 488 is the 48th group of 10 plus 8. Wait, maybe I should think differently. The number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of times the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8), so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8. But in the partial cycle from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many full blocks there are and how many partial. The first block is 80-89: 10 numbers. Then 180-189: another 10. Then 280-289: another 10. Then 380-389: another 10. Then 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, each full block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, and the last block contributes 9 numbers. So, total number of times 8 appears in the tens place: 4 full blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 from the last partial block, so 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 8's in the hundreds place: 0. So, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that can't be right because I just got 98 for 8's, but earlier I had 187 for 4's. So, 187 - 98 = 89. But wait, let me double-check because that seems like a big difference. Let me recount the 8's, maybe I made a mistake. Units place: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus the last partial group from 481-488, which has 8 in the units place at 488, so that's one more, making it 49. That seems correct. Tens place: 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 in tens place. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. So, 4's:187, 8's:98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any cases. For the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. For the tens place, 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Units place: 48 times. So, 50 + 48 +89=187. For the 8's, units place: 49, tens place:49, so 98. So, 187-98=89. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Total occurrences: 48 (from 1 to 480) + 0 (481-488) = 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block has 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Total occurrences: 48 (from 1 to 480) + 1 (488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each full block contributes 10 numbers, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in any page number up to 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- More 4's than 8's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Let me see how many times that happens. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Well, every 10 numbers, there's one such number. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, does 488 itself end with an 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is 488, so from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 times, so 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. The first is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 occurrences. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. That would be from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add those up: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Again, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, so 48 times. The last 8 in the units place would be 488, so that's included. So, 48 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the tens place. The ranges would be 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let's count each range: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 49 + 0=97. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 97=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: Units:48, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total:187. For 8's: Units:48, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total:97. So, 187-97=90. Hmm, but let me check if I counted correctly, especially in the tens place for 8's. When I did 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's correct because 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, 49 in the tens place. So, 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90.

    "text": " Wait, let me check how many times that happens. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? Well, it's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, it's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit 4 appears in 488? No, 488 ends with 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484. So, from 4, 14, ..., 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated as floor((N)/10) + 1 if the last digit is 4, but in this case, N is 488, which ends with 8, so it's floor(488/10) = 48 times. So, 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included, but since it doesn't end with 4, it's 48 times. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit from the right. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, 440-449 is valid, but 480-489 would go beyond, but 488 is the last page. So, how many sets of ten have 4 in the tens place? Let's see: 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. Now, 480-489 would be the next, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480-489 is a set of ten, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 4 in 480-488 is only 9 numbers. So, total for the tens place: 4 full decades (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Plus the partial decade 440-449: 10, so 50. Wait, no, 440-449 is another 10, so that's 5 full decades, but wait, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: that's 5 sets, each 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, in the 400s, 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, 10 numbers. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is the first digit from the left. So, when does 4 appear in the hundreds place? That's from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. Wait, 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, but let's see. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 ends with 8, so that's included. So, how many? Let's calculate: The last number is 488, which is 48*10 + 8. So, 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, that's (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. So, numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many full decades? 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total for tens place: 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since 8 is higher than 4, it doesn't appear in the hundreds place for any page number up to 488. So, 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 48 such numbers since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, which truncates to 48, but since 484 is included, it's 48 times.\n   - **Tens Place:** 4 appears in the tens place in decades like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 full decades (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** 8 appears in decades like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full decades and the partial 480-488, contributing 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place as the maximum is 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{89}."

    "text": " Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484. How many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the number of times would be the total number of tens. Let me calculate: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 is the last page, so in the 488th page, the units digit is 8, not 4. So, the 48th set ends at 480, right? So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 4's in the units place. But wait, 480 is page 480, which is within 488, so that's correct. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's one range, 140-149: another, 240-249: another, 340-349: another, and 440-449: another. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, so that's fine. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's do the same for 8's. Again, considering units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to 4, it's the total number of tens, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. So, 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 8. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. 80-89: one range, 180-189: another, 280-289: another, 380-389: another. So, that's 4 ranges. Each contributes 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40. Wait, but 380-389 is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place: 40 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 40 = 88. So, total 8's: 88. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 88 (8's) = 99. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place: 48, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For 8's: units:48, tens:40, hundreds:0. 48+40=88. So, 187-88=99. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Let me check that again. The tens place for 4's: ranges are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 is correct. For the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. So, 187 total 4's. For 8's, units:48, correct. Tens:4 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 40. Correct. So, 88 total 8's. So, difference is 187-88=99. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have missed something. Let me think again. When counting the units place for 4's, I considered 488/10=48.8, so 48 times. But wait, from 1 to 488, the last number with 4 in the units place is 484, which is 48th multiple of 10 plus 4. So, yes, 48 times. Similarly, for 8's, the last number with 8 in the units place is 488, which is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 8, so 48 times. So that's correct. For the tens place, 4's: five ranges, each 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. 8's: four ranges, each 10 numbers, so 40. Correct. Hundreds place: 4's: 89, 8's:0. So, yes, 187-88=99. So, the answer should be 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 488 / 10 = 48 complete sets, so 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 488 / 10 = 48 complete sets, so 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, and 380-389. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 4 ranges \u00d7 10 = 40 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 48 (units) + 40 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **88**.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 88 (8's) = **99**.\n\n$\\boxed{99}$"

    "text": " Wait, does 488 include 488? Let me check: 488 is the last page, so the units digit goes up to 8 in 488. So, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, and in each cycle, 4 appears once. How many complete cycles of 10 are there in 488? Let's divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. So, there are 48 complete cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, in the 488th page, the units digit is 8, so the 48th cycle ends at 480, right? So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 4's in the units place. Now, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no additional 4's there. So, total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Let's find how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), the next is 140-149, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 would be within 488, right? So, how many blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49 is one block, then each subsequent hundred adds another block. So, up to 488, how many hundreds? 488 is in the 400's, so there are 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 4's, so that's 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 end before 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times 8 appears in the units place. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, so there are 48 complete cycles, each contributing one 8. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit in 488 is 8, so that's included in the 48th cycle. So, units place 8's: 48. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-489 would be 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488). So, how many blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89 is one block (10 numbers), 180-189 is another, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So that's 5 blocks, but the last block only has 9 numbers. So, for the first four blocks, each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the last block contributes 9 8's. So, total 8's in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the 800's, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, total 8's: 97. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 97 = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's and 8's again. For 4's: units: 48, tens: 50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units:48, tens:49, hundreds:0. 48+49=97. 187-97=90. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me check the tens place for 8's again. I said that 480-488 is the last block, which is 9 numbers. So, 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, so 4\u00d710=40 +9=49. That seems correct. Similarly, for 4's in the tens place, we have 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 4's, so 50. Units place for both 4's and 8's: 48 each. Hundreds place for 4's:89, and 0 for 8's. So, yes, 187-97=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 480, there are 48 complete cycles, contributing 48 4's. From 481 to 488, no additional 4's. Total: 48.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 4's.

    "text": " Wait, let me think about how many times this happens. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, starting from 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? 488 ends with 8, so the last number with a 4 in the units place would be 484. So, from 4 to 484, that's 48 numbers. But wait, 4 is the first, then 14, 24,...,484. So, that's 48 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 1-99, there's 40-49 (10 numbers). In 100-199, it's 140-149 (10 numbers). Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences. Wait, but let me check: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Yes, and 488 is higher, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. That would be pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but let me check: 400 is the first, then 401, 402,...,488. So, that's 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 occurrences of the digit 4. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, but since 488 ends with 8, that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28,...,488. So, how many terms in this sequence? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. The last term is 488, so 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. Subtract 8: (n-1)*10 = 480. So, n-1 = 48, so n=49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. That would be numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let me count how many ranges: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 ranges with 10 numbers each and one range with 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit would be 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49+49=98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89.

    "text": " Wait, does 484 count? Let me check. 484 is within 488, so yes. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place would be the number of complete groups of 10. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit goes up to 8, which is less than 10, so actually, the number of 4's in the units place is 48. Wait, but 488 is included, so let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's the same as the number of times 4 appears in the units place, which is every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. Let's see how many terms there are in this sequence. The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100, 40-49: 10 numbers. From 101-200, 140-149: 10 numbers. From 201-300, 240-249: 10 numbers. From 301-400, 340-349: 10 numbers. From 401-488, 440-449: 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, from 401-488, the tens place is 4 only from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. But wait, in each of these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, okay. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many terms. The first term is 8, last term is 488. Common difference 10. Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many blocks. From 1-100: 80-89: 10 numbers. 101-200: 180-189:10. 201-300:280-289:10. 301-400:380-389:10. 401-488: The next would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 480 +1 =9 numbers. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but let me think again. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 8. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) would have 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total tens place 8's:40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds =49+49+0=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 4's in units place: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks (1-100, 101-200, ..., 401-488).\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - From 1-400, there are 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers: 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - From 401-488, 8 appears in 480-488: 9 numbers.\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book only has 488 pages.\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, 484 is within 488, so that's fine. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a cycle, it's 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That would be 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so in the last partial cycle (480-488), the units digit goes from 0 to 8. So, 480, 481, ..., 488. The units digit 4 appears once here, at 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 (from the full cycles) + 1 (from the partial cycle) = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within that. Let me count how many full blocks there are. Each block contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. From 1-99: 40-49 is one block, so 10 times. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10 times. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10 times. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10 times. From 400-488: 440-449, which is another 10 times. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, total tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but wait, actually, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, hundreds place 4's: 89. Now, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8. Then, in the last partial cycle (480-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included. So, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Each full block contributes 10 occurrences. Let's see: From 1-99: 80-89, 10 times. From 100-199: 180-189, 10 times. From 200-299: 280-289, 10 times. From 300-399: 380-389, 10 times. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), so only 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place here. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (from 1-399) and one block of 9 (400-488). So, 4*10=40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me verify the 4's again: Units place: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me see how many times this happens. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, there's one such number. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does the last group have a 4 in the units place? The last number is 488, which ends with 8, so the last number with a 4 in the units place would be 484. So, 484 is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is within 1-99. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. Wait, let me check. From 1-99: 40-49 is one block (10 numbers). Then 100-199: 140-149 (another 10). 200-299: 240-249 (another 10). 300-399: 340-349 (another 10). 400-488: 440-449 (another 10). So that's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. Okay, so 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 4 appears 187 times. Now, let's do the same for 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But let's check the last number: 488 ends with 8, so the last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier thought. Let me think again. The first number ending with 8 is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? It's an arithmetic sequence where the first term is 8, the last term is 488, and the common difference is 10. The number of terms can be found by ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 8 appears 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. This occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Let me count how many full blocks there are. From 1-99: 80-89 is one block (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers). So, the first four blocks are complete, each contributing 10 numbers, and the last block contributes 9. So, total is 4 x 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 8 does not appear in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, maybe that's correct. But let me verify the units and tens counts again to make sure I didn't overcount. For 4's in units place: numbers ending with 4 up to 488. The last such number is 484, which is 484 = 4 x 121, so 121st multiple of 4, but that's not relevant. Wait, the count is every 10 numbers, so from 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The nth term is 10(n-1) +4. So, 10(n-1)+4 \u2264488. Let's solve for n: 10(n-1) \u2264484 \u2192 n-1 \u226448.4 \u2192 n \u226449.4. So, n=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Wait, this is conflicting. Let me recalculate. If the last term is 484, then the number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, actually, it's 49 times, not 48. Wait, so I made a mistake earlier. I thought it was 48, but it's actually 49. So, units place for 4 is 49, not 48. Similarly, for 8 in units place, I had 49, which is correct. So, correcting the 4's count: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total 4's=49+50+89=188. Wait, that's different. Let me check again. So, units place for 4: 4,14,...,484. Number of terms: (484-4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. Tens place for 4: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and as before, there are 5 blocks, so 5x10=50. Hundreds place for 4: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, total 4's=49+50+89=188. Now, for 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. So, total 8's=98. Therefore, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, so earlier I had 187-98=89, but now it's 188-98=90. Which is correct? Let me double-check the units place for 4. The first number is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? Let's compute (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. So, earlier I had 48, which was wrong. So, the correct count for 4's is 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Numbers ending with 4: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.  \n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - Blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   - Each block has 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks.  \n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - Pages 400-488: 89 numbers.  \n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Numbers ending with 8: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.  \n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - Blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.  \n   - First four blocks have 10 each, last block has 9.  \n   - Total: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - No pages in 800-899, so 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me calculate how many times this happens. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, I think I should take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning there are 48 full tens and then 8 extra numbers. So, in the units place, from 1 to 480, there are 48 occurrences of 4, and then in 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again in the units place. So, total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. So, 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400 to 488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Again, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 does appear once more. So, 48 + 1 = 49 occurrences of 8 in the units place. Wait, let me check: from 1-480, there are 48 occurrences, and 488 is included, so units digit 8 appears once more, making it 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 4 blocks contribute 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 occurrences. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because 187 - 98 is 89, but I might have made a mistake in counting. Let me go through each step again.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 times (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, and 488 is included, but the units digit 4 doesn't appear again because 488's units digit is 8. So, 48 is correct.\n\n- Tens place: From 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Units place: From 1-488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place, so 48 full blocks (480 numbers), which is 48 occurrences. Then, 488 is the 489th number, which is 488, so units digit 8 appears once more. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: The blocks are 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because 8's in the tens place from 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? So, that's correct. But let me think again: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), each with 8 in the tens place. So, yes, 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 in the tens place. So, 49 in units and 49 in tens, totaling 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I double-counted somewhere. Let me check: for 4's in the hundreds place, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's, the hundreds place is 0, so no issues there.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place.\n   - Total: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every block of 100 numbers has a sequence (e.g., 40-49) where the tens digit is 4.\n   - Blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total: 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place.\n   - Total: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 occurrences. Plus one more in 488.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each, last block contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No pages with 8 in the hundreds place (800-899 exceed 488).\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Wait, does 488 have a 4 in the units place? No, because 488 ends with 8. So, the last page with a 4 in the units place would be 484. Let me calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, the total number would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, it's 48 times. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4. But actually, 488 is the last page, so the last group is 480-488, which includes 484. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is 488, so 488 is the 488th page. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, meaning 48 times. So, 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 pages where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 pages) From 100-199: 140-149 (10 pages) From 200-299: 240-249 (10 pages) From 300-399: 340-349 (10 pages) From 400-488: 440-449 (10 pages) Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 pages. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens from page 400 to 488. So, pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. How many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 pages because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's printed: 187.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, meaning 48 8's. But wait, 488 is included, so does that add an extra 8? Let me check: 488 is the last page, so the units digit is 8, so that's included in the 488th page. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then the 488th page adds another 8. Wait, no, because 488 is the 488th page, so in the units place, 8 appears once every 10 pages. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means 48 times, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 times. Wait, let me think again. For example, from 1-10: 8 appears once (page 8). From 11-20: page 18. So, each 10 pages contribute one 8 in the units place. So, 488 pages would have 48 full groups of 10, which is 480 pages, contributing 48 8's. Then, pages 481-488: that's 8 pages, 481-488. In these, the units digit is 1-8, so page 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more 8. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Each block has 10 pages where the tens digit is 8, except the last one which has 9 pages (480-488). So, let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 pages\n- 180-189: 10 pages\n- 280-289: 10 pages\n- 380-389: 10 pages\n- 480-488: 9 pages (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 80-89: 10 pages. Then each subsequent hundred has another 10 pages. So, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's four blocks, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488: that's 9 pages, so 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place from page 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no pages where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 49 + 49 is 98, but let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier, for 4's, I had 187. So, the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89. But wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, for the 4's, I had:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 187.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89. But let me think again.\n\nWait, for the units place of 8's, I had 49. Let me confirm that.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 pages, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. So, 49 units place 8's.\n\nFor the tens place, as I thought, 4 blocks of 10 pages each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 10 each, so 40, plus the 480-488 block contributing 9, so 49. So, 49 tens place 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nFor the 4's, units: 48, tens: 50, hundreds: 89, total 187.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the 4's again. For the tens place, I had 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each has 10 pages, so 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place, 400-488: that's 89 pages, so 89 4's.\n\nUnits place: 48, as 488 /10 is 48.8, so 48 times.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so does 488 have a 4 in the units place? No, it's 8. So, the last 4 in the units place is 484. So, from 4 to 484, that's (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number by 10 and taking the integer part. So, 488 /10=48.8, so 48 times. So, 48 4's in the units place.\n\nWait, but when I did the 8's, I had 49 because 488 is included, so perhaps for the 4's, I should check if 484 is included, which it is, so 48 times.\n\nSo, 48 units, 50 tens, 89 hundreds: 187.\n\nFor 8's: 49 units, 49 tens, 0 hundreds: 98.\n\nDifference: 187 -98=89.\n\nHmm, but I'm a bit unsure because I remember sometimes when counting digits, you have to be careful with the last block. Let me check the 4's again.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Wait, so that's 49 times. But earlier I thought it was 48. Which is correct?\n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but in reality, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 49 because 484 is the 48th multiple, but wait, no. Let me list them: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, actually, it's 49 times. So, I was wrong earlier; it's 49 4's in the units place, not 48.\n\nWait, that changes things. So, units place for 4's:49.\n\nThen, tens place:50.\n\nHundreds place:89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place was 48, but now I'm getting 49. Let me clarify.\n\nThe formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor(N/10). So, for N=488, floor(488/10)=48. But wait, when N=488, the units digit 4 appears at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. But when I list them as 4,14,24,...,484, that's 49 terms because starting at 4, each step is +10, so the number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1=49.\n\nWait, but floor(488/10)=48, but the actual count is 49 because 484 is the 49th term. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let's take a smaller example. From 1 to 14, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's at 4 and 14, so 2 times. Using floor(14/10)=1, but actual count is 2. So, the formula floor(N/10) gives 1, but actual count is 2. So, the correct formula is floor((N - d)/10) +1, where d is the digit. So, for d=4, it's floor((488 -4)/10)+1= floor(484/10)+1=48+1=49.\n\nSo, I was wrong earlier; it's 49 4's in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, N=488, d=8. So, floor((488 -8)/10)+1= floor(480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place.\n\nSo, correcting my earlier mistake:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference:188 -98=90.\n\nWait, so I initially thought 89, but after correcting the units place for 4's, it's 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check the tens place for 8's. Earlier, I thought it was 49. Let me see:\n\nTens place for 8's:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488.\n\nEach of the first four blocks has 10 pages, contributing 10 8's each, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 pages, so 9 8's. So, total tens place 8's:40+9=49.\n\nSo, 49 tens place 8's.\n\nUnits place 8's:49.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:50\n\nHundreds:89\n\nTotal:188.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, correct? 488-400+1=89.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, 89 hundreds place 4's.\n\nTens place:50.\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nTotal:188.\n\n8's:98.\n\nDifference:90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\) full groups, but since 484 is included, it's actually 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\) occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears from page 400 to 488.\n   - Number of pages: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total number of 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\) full groups, plus one more for 488, totaling 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 occurrences, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\) occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's minus number of 8's: \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Let me see, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place. The first such number is 4, and the last is 484. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find how many terms are there, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: (Last term - First term) / Common difference + 1. Here, the common difference is 10. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's look at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, etc. Let me calculate how many such ranges there are up to 488. The first range is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), and 340-349 (another 10). Then, from 400-488, the next range would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, how many such ranges do we have? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through each digit position again. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 ends with an 8, so the last number is 488. So, how many terms? Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let me check. The first range is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and then 480-488. But 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. Wait, no: 480 is the first, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, right? Wait, 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, each of the first four ranges contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the last one contributes 9. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4 * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4 full ranges and a partial one. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 4's, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, does 488 have a 4 in the units place? No, 488 ends with an 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place from 1 to 488? Well, every 10 numbers, there's one 4. So, from 1 to 480, there are 480 / 10 = 48 occurrences. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so no additional 4's. So, total 4's in units place: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically from x40 to x49, where x is any digit. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449, right? Let me check: 440-449 is within 488, but 480-489 would go beyond 488, so the tens place 4's would be up to 449. How many sets of 100 are there? From 1-488, there are 488 numbers, so 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. Wait, no, actually, 488 is less than 500, so maybe it's 4 full hundreds and then 88 more. Wait, perhaps a better way is to consider each hundred block separately.\n\nIn each hundred block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, from 1-400, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100. In each set, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40 times. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but wait, from 1-400, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. Wait, but 400 is included in the 400-499 range, but the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, but 450-488 is beyond 449, so yes, 440-449 is included. So, total 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50 times. Wait, but earlier I thought 4 sets, but actually, from 1-400, it's 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, that's 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 50. So, total 4's in tens place: 50.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The tens digit is 4 in the ranges:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nThat's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. So, yes, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 400 is included, 401, 402,..., up to 488. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that happens.\n\nFrom 1-488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so the number of 8's in the units place is the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any remaining.\n\nTotal numbers: 488. Number of complete decades: 488 // 10 = 48 (since 48 \u00d7 10 = 480). So, 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the 8 in the units place occurs once more (488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 480 is the last multiple of 10 before 488, so 480 is included in the 48 complete decades. Then, 481-488 includes 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, yes, 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers from x80 to x89, where x is any digit. So, in each hundred block, there's a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such sets exist up to 488.\n\nFrom 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, but wait, 480-489 would be 10, but we only go up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Wait, but 480-488 includes 480, 481, ..., 488. The tens digit is 8 for all these numbers because 480 is 4 8 0, 481 is 4 8 1, etc., up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, how many sets do we have?\n\nFrom 80-89: 10\n180-189: 10\n280-289: 10\n380-389: 10\n480-488: 9\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? For each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.), except the last one, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Then, in the last hundred block (401-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total sets:\n\n- 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10\n- 101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10\n- 201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10\n- 301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10\n- 401-488: 480-488 \u2192 9\n\nSo, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the hundreds place has 0 occurrences of 8.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I thought units place was 49 and tens place was 49, so total 98 8's. But let me double-check.\n\nWait, units place: 49\nTens place: 49\nHundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 187 and 8's are 98, so the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48\nTens place: 50\nHundreds place: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place: 49\nHundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. That seems correct too.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 480-488 contributes 9, and each previous hundred contributes 10. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, we had 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. That's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused about the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's. That seems correct.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 187, and 8's are 98, so the difference is 89.\n\nWait, but let me check the 8's again. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so 98 total. That seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 89 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is 187, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Wait, does 488 count? No, because 488 is the last page, but 488 ends with an 8, so the units digit is 8. So, the last number with a 4 in the units place would be 484. How many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're dealing with whole numbers, that would mean 48 full cycles of 10, and then 8 more numbers. In each cycle, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 times from the full cycles, and then in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full tens and 8 extra numbers. So, 48 times 1 (from each ten) plus 1 more from the extra 8 numbers, totaling 49. Okay, that seems right. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, meaning 4 full hundreds and 88 extra pages. Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) has one block where the tens digit is 4 (40-49, 140-149, etc.), each contributing 10 numbers. So, 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's another 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, hundreds place 4's: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48 \u00d7 1 = 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 numbers. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, there are 4 full hundreds, so 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 would be in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but 480-489 would be the next block, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. Therefore, total tens place 8's: 40 (from the full blocks) + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), each with an 8 in the tens place. So, yes, 9 more. So, 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers.\n   - Total occurrences: 48 full cycles (48 \u00d7 1) + 1 in the last 8 numbers = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Total occurrences: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 + 10 in 440-449 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers.\n   - Total occurrences: 48 full cycles + 1 in the last 8 numbers = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Total occurrences: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 + 9 in 480-488 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me see how many times this happens. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8. Since we can't have a fraction of a count, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does the last cycle go up to 488? Let me check: 480 to 488. The units digit 4 occurs at 484, which is within this range. So, I think it's 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. Then 100-199: 140-149, another range. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 300-399: 340-349, and 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times.

So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in terms of the hundreds digit, every number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4. So, that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4, the digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times, but wait, 488 is included. So, the last occurrence is 488, which is a units digit of 8. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This happens in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) have 10 numbers each, and the last range (480-488) has 9 numbers. So, total tens digit 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above, which doesn't happen here. So, the hundreds digit is never 8 in this book. So, total number of 8's is units + tens: 48 + 49 = 97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 97 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units:48, tens:49. 48+49=97. 187-97=90. That seems correct. I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times the hundreds digit is 4. Yes, that's correct. And for the tens digit of 8, I had 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. That seems right. Units digits for both 4 and 8 are 48 each, which makes sense because 488/10=48.8, so 48 full cycles. So, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 48 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range has 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 48 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges have 10 each, and the last has 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in any page number up to 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, does 488 have a units digit of 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? From 1 to 488, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, I think it's 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4. So that's 48 times. But wait, does 488 include an extra 4 in the units place? Let me check: 480 to 488 includes 484, which is a 4 in the units place, so yes, that's included in the 48. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have a 4 in the hundreds place? Well, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, but the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's the number of pages from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages. Wait, but each page number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Wait, but 400 is page 400, 401 is 401, up to 488. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 itself ends with an 8, so does that count? Yes, because 488 is included. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers. So, blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with an 8 in the tens place. How many such blocks? From 0-99: 80-89 is one block. 100-199: 180-189. 200-299: 280-289. 300-399: 380-389. 400-488: 480-488. So, that's 5 blocks. Each contributes 10 8's, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers: 480, 481,...,488. So, does that mean the tens place has only 9 8's in that last block? Because 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? Wait, 480 has 8 in the tens place, 481 has 8, ..., up to 488. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, that block contributes 9 8's instead of 10. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, etc.) contribute 10 each, but the last block (480-488) contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier by assuming 5 blocks each with 10. So, correcting that, tens place: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, total 8's: 97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48 + 50 = 98, +89 = 187. For 8's: units 48, tens 49, hundreds 0. 48 + 49 = 97. So, 187 - 97 = 90. Hmm, but I feel like that's correct, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389:10. Then 480-488: 9 numbers, each with 8 in tens place. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, 49 in tens place. Units place: 48, since 488 includes an 8 in units place, so yes, 48. So, 48+49=97. So, 4's are 187, 8's are 97, difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 48 such occurrences (488 / 10 = 48.8, rounded down to 48).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks of 10 (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449). Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). However, the last block (440-449) is fully within 488, so 5 * 10 = 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nTotal 4's = 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 48 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488). The first four blocks each contribute 10 occurrences, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9. Total = 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in any page number up to 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 48 (units) + 49 (tens) = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me figure out how many times this happens. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, the last number is 488, which is 48*10 + 8, so the 48th block ends at 480. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so no additional 4 in the units place. Therefore, units place contributes 48 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 140-149 (10) From 200-299: 240-249 (10) From 300-399: 340-349 (10) From 400-488: 440-449 (10) Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, there are 187 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Again, every block of 10 contributes one 8. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8. But wait, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the 48th block ends at 480, and then 481-488 includes 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more 8. So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. Specifically, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the last block. Each full block (like 80-89) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count the blocks: 80-89: 10 numbers 180-189: 10 280-289: 10 380-389: 10 480-488: 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers, since 488 - 480 +1 =9) So, the first four blocks are full, each contributing 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: (4 * 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, the total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, we subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total blocks of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full blocks.\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Number of such blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers.\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total blocks of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full blocks.\n   - Additionally, 488 includes an extra 8 in the units place.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Full blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 (4 blocks).\n   - Partial block: 480-488 (9 numbers).\n   - Total 8's in tens place: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book only goes up to 488.\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**\n187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **89**.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484, right? So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see: every 10 numbers, there's one 4. So, how many groups of 10 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10 and then 8 more numbers. So, in each group of 10, there's one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, in the last partial group (481-488), does 484 fall into that? Yes, 484 is within 481-488, so that's another 4. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, no, wait. Because 488 is the last page, so from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is actually 48 full times (each 10 numbers) plus one more in the 480-488 range, which is 484. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but actually, 488 is the last page, so let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Yes, so 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit from the right. So, for example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the 440-449 range is within 488, right? So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see: Each hundred has a block where the tens digit is 4, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, from 1 to 488, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 in the tens place. Then 140-149: another 10, so 10 more. Similarly, 240-249: 10, and 340-349: 10. Then 440-449: 10. Now, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 times, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, total 50 times. Wait, but let me check: 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5*10=50. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is the range where the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, in each of these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 times. Wait, but wait, 488 is included, so yes, 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Wait, that seems high. Wait, let me double-check. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's:188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see: From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28,...,488. So, the number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit from the right. So, for example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers, because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9). So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block which is only 9. So, let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total tens place 8's:10+10+10+10+9=49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the hundreds place. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's:0 times. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 blocks.\n   - Total occurrences: 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488.\n   - Total numbers: 89 (400 to 488 inclusive).\n   - Total occurrences: 89 times.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n- 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488 (9 numbers).\n   - Total occurrences: 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (pages go up to 488).\n   - Total occurrences: 0 times.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n- 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, does 488 have a 4 in the units place? No, it's 488, so the last page with a 4 in the units place would be 484. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers has one such number. So, from 1-488, there are 488 numbers. Divided by 10, that's 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks, and then 8 numbers left in the 489th block (481-488). Since 481-488 includes 484, which is the 489th number, but wait, actually, 488 is the last page. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times. Hmm, but wait, when we count from 1 to 488, the first 4 in the units place is 4, then 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many numbers is that? Let me calculate it as (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that's 49 times. So, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me think again. The formula for counting numbers with a specific digit in a specific place is: For units place, the count is floor((n - digit)/10) + 1. So, for 4 in units place up to 488, it's floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1 = floor(484/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. Okay, so 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. The digit 4 can appear in the tens place as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is okay, but 540-549 would be beyond 488, so we don't need to consider that. So, how many full blocks of 100 have the tens digit as 4? Each block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-488, how many such blocks? Let's see: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The digit 4 can appear in the hundreds place as 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? Let's use the same formula: floor((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = floor(480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** How many times does 8 appear in the tens place? The tens digit is 8 in numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488), right? Because 488 is the last page. So, let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49 times. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total 98 8's. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each block of 100 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 5 such blocks, contributing 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each block of 100 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), plus 9 occurrences in 480-488, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, let me see. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, from 1 to 480, that's 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of 10. So, 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again. So, total 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times. Now, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places for 4's: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, meaning 48 times. But wait, does 488 end with an 8? Yes, so actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (each 10 numbers) plus one more number (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th set, right? Let me think. From 1 to 480, that's 48 sets of 10, so 48 times. Then, 481-488: the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8. So, ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers, since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, and the last one has 9. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book doesn't have 800 pages. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places for 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times. So, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, this happens 48 times (480 / 10) + 0 (since 488 doesn't add another 4 in the units place).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears 49 times (48 full sets of 10 and once in 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 doesn't appear, so 0 times.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Wait, 488 is the last page, so the units place 4 would go up to 484. Let me see: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, there's one 4. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10. But wait, does that mean 48 times? Or should I check if 488 is included? Let me think. The units digit cycles every 10, so 1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in each group of 10, the units digit 4 appears once. So, how many complete groups are there? From 1 to 480, that's 48 groups of 10. So, 48 times 4 in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484). So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so the 440-449 range is included, but 540-549 is beyond 488, so we don't include that. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Each of these ranges (40-49, 140-149, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 10 times each. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0 to 488, the tens digit 4 occurs in:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's. So 5 * 10 = 50. Hmm, but wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place, which is the third digit. This happens from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Wait, but I'm only counting how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place, so that's 89. So total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4's appear 188 times.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? From 1 to 488, each 10 numbers contributes one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups. Each group contributes one 8. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once at 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is included. So, let's see how many such ranges:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 488 - 480 + 1 = 9)\n\nWait, so the first four ranges each have 10 numbers, but the last one (480-488) has only 9 because 489 is beyond 488. So, total tens place 8's: 4 * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.

    "text": " Let me see how many times that happens. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that's 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). But in the units place, only 484 would have a 4 in the units place in that last partial block. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last block is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. The 484 is within this block, so yes, that's one more 4. So, 48 * 1 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in entire decades, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let me figure out how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one block, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another block, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many blocks? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This would be from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, every block of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many such blocks? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, and then the last 8 numbers (481-488) where 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is valid. So, how many such blocks? Let's see: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers). Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the last block contributes 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in the tens place: (4 * 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's here. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

    "text": " Wait, does 488 have a units digit of 4? No, it's 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484. So, how many 4's are there in the units place? Let me think. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, I guess it's 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times 1 equals 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, and the last group is 480-488. So, 484 is within this group, so that's the 48th 4 in the units place. So, units place gives 48 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in the 40s, 140s, 240s, 340s, and 440s. That's 5 ranges, each giving 10 fours. So, 5 times 10 equals 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This happens in the range 400-488. How many numbers are there here? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Adding up all the fours: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187 fours. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many 8's are in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 ends with an 8, so does that mean the 48th group is 480-488, and the 8 in 488 is the 48th 8 in the units place. So, 48 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This occurs in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one which only goes up to 488, so how many numbers? From 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), 4 (400-488). So, the hundreds digit is never 8 in this book. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 187 (fours) - 97 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** Every 10 numbers contribute one 4. From 1 to 488, there are 48 such occurrences (488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 times).\n2. **Tens place:** The ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449 each contribute 10 fours. That's 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 contribute 89 fours (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nTotal fours: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, there are 48 eights.\n2. **Tens place:** Ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488 contribute 10 each for the first four and 9 for the last. Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal eights: 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 fours - 97 eights = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484, right? Let me calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, it's 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4. So that's 48 times. But wait, the last set would be from 480 to 488, which includes 484 as the 4 in the units place. So yes, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times the 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers in the units place. From 1 to 488, that's 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. So, 48 times in the units place. But wait, does 488 include an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with an 8, so that's included in the 48th set. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is one block. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: 480-488. So that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except the last one, which is only 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, 488 - 480 +1 = 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks each have 10 8's, and the last block has 9. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, 97 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, +89=187. That seems correct. For 8's: units 48, tens 49, hundreds 0. 48+49=97. 187-97=90. Hmm, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 8's in the tens place for that block. The other blocks: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). So, 4 blocks with 10 each, that's 40, plus 9, totaling 49. That seems right. So, yes, 97 8's. So, 187-97=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Let me figure out how many times this happens. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The first term is 4, the last term is 484, and the common difference is 10. To find the number of terms, I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d. Here, a_n is 484, a_1 is 4, d is 10. So, 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 4: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488. Let me check if 484 is the last one before 488. 484 + 10 is 494, which is beyond 488, so yes, 484 is the last one. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many times this happens. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) has a block where the tens digit is 4. Wait, but in the 400-488 range, the tens digit can only go up to 8, but the tens digit being 4 would be 440-449. So, for each hundred block except the last one, there's a full set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me calculate: - 0-99: 40-49: 10 numbers. - 100-199: 140-149: 10 numbers. - 200-299: 240-249: 10 numbers. - 300-399: 340-349: 10 numbers. - 400-488: 440-449: 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. Wait, but let me make sure. Each hundred block has a 4 in the tens place for 10 numbers. So, 0-99: 40-49, 10 numbers. 100-199: 140-149, 10. 200-299: 240-249, 10. 300-399: 340-349, 10. 400-488: 440-449, 10. So, 5 blocks, each 10, so 50. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me add that again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many terms there are. The first term is 8, the last term is 488, common difference 10. Using the formula: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 8: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n=49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, 488 is included. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the tens place. So, in each hundred block, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Let me count each block. - 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. - 100-199: 180-189: 10 numbers. - 200-299: 280-289: 10 numbers. - 300-399: 380-389: 10 numbers. - 400-488: 480-488: let's see, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Wait, let me check that again. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=49+49=98. Difference=188-98=90. Hmm, that seems right. Wait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. When I was counting the tens place for 4's, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each of those is 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 49. That also seems correct. So, I think the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: \\( \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488.\n   - Total numbers: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: \\( \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 numbers each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Total: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's minus number of 8's: \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Well, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups. In each group, 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, does 488 include another 4 in the units place? No, because 488 ends with 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence.

Wait, but 440-449 would be beyond 488, so I need to check. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?

But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the fifth hundred would be 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, the last block in the hundreds place is 400-488. So, how many complete blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times.

From 1-99: 40-49 is one block, so 10 times. 100-199: 140-149, another 10. 200-299: 240-249, 10. 300-399: 340-349, 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers.

So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but I'm only counting the digit 4 in the hundreds place, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total number of 4's is 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? From 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups. Each group has one 8 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, which ends with 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, no. Let me think: the first 8 is at 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's break it down: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, each of these blocks contributes 10, except the last one, which contributes 9. So, total tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10, contributing 48 occurrences. The last 4 in the units place is at 484, so no additional 4's here.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks (including 440-449 within 488), each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = **187**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (including 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 complete blocks contributing 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **89**\n\n\\boxed{89}"
