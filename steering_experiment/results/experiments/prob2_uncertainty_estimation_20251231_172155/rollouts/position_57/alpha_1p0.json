Maybe I should cross-verify. Let me recount the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place for fours: every 10 numbers, so 4,14,...,484. 484 is the 49th term, so 49 fours. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place, 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th term, so 49 eights. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set has only 9 numbers (480-488). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. For the fours: units place, I counted 49, which seems right because from 4 to 484, that's 484/10 =48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 10 per hundred, and there are 5 hundreds (0-9, 100-199, etc.), so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So 49+50+89=188.
