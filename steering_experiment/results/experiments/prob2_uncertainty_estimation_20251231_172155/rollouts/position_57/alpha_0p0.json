    "text": " So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each step again. Counting 4's: Units place. From 4,14,...,484. That's (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So, 5 sets, 10 each, total 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. Good. Now, 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. That's (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me think again. When counting the hundreds place for 4's, from 400 to 488, inclusive. 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 fours in hundreds place. Yes. For the tens place, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's included in the 50. Okay, I think my counts are correct.

I think I've got it.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear \u2192 0 times.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
