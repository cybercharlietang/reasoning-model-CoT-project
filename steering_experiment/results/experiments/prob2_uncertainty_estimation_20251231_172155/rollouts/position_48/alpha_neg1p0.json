    "text": " 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total eights in the tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, let me add that again: 10+10=20, +10=30, +10=40, +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. I think that's correct. Let me just check if I missed any numbers or counted something extra. For units place of fours: from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers, which is 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place of fours: each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in tens place, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, ..., 400-488). Wait, no, actually, from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place of fours: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. For eights: units place is 49, tens place is 49, so 98 total. So, 188-98=90. Yep, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., contributing 10 per block.

Wait, let me recount: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.

Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, same for 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each 10, so 4*10=40, plus 480-488 which is 9, so total 49.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the tens place for fours. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct. For hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. For eights: units place, 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. Number of terms: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place for eights: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10, the last has 9, so 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights. The difference is 90.

So, that's 10 +10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488.
