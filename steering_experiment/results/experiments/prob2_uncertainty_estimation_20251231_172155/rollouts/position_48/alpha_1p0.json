Now, the next set would be 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 eights in the tens place here. So, total in tens place is 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours -98 eights=90.

So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each step again. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for eights. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers. Then 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, which is 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. Similarly, for fours in the tens place, we had 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, so 50. And hundreds place for fours:400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. Units place for fours: from 4,14,...484. Let me confirm how many numbers that is. The formula is (last - first)/step +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units place. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. So, 188-98=90.

Because 450-488 would have 5 in the hundreds place, but the tens digit would be 5 or higher, but we're only counting 4's in the tens place. So, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

So, 4 full sets (80-89, etc.) each giving 10 eights, and the last set 480-488 giving 9 eights. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. That adds up to 49 in the tens place for eights. Units place for eights is 49, as from 8,18,...,488, which is 49 numbers. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.

That's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each set has 10, and there are 5 sets, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So total eights:49+49=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " For each hundred block, except the last one, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 40 eights. Now, the last set is 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 9 more eights in the tens place. So total in tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place, I thought 49, but let me recount. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each 10 numbers, there's one 4 in the units place. How many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours. But wait, the last set is 480-488, which includes 484 as the 49th occurrence. So, yes, 49 fours in units place. Then, tens place: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49 +50 +89=188. That's correct. For eights: units place: 49, as from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, that's 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 in tens place. Units and tens add up to 98 eights. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check: from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. And in the tens place, 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Units place, 49 fours. So, 188 fours total. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting, it's easy to miscount. Let me try another approach. Maybe I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position. For the units digit: For any digit d (except maybe the last few if the total isn't a multiple of 10), each digit from 0-9 appears equally in the units place. So, for 488 pages, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 fours and 48 eights. But wait, the last group is 480-488, which has 9 numbers. So, in the units place, in the last group, 480-488, the units digits go from 0 to 8. So, 8 is included, but 9 is not. So, in the units place, we have 48 complete groups (1-480), each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 fours and 48 eights. Then, in the last group (481-488), the units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units fours:48+1=49, units eights:48+1=49. So that's correct.\n\nNow, for the tens place: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.) and similarly 10 where it's 8 (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for each 100 numbers, 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. Now, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, for each complete hundred, 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds \u00d710=40 fours and 40 eights. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit being 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, the tens digit being 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, in the tens place, in the last partial hundred, we have 10 fours and 9 eights. So, total tens fours:40+10=50, tens eights:40+9=49.\n\nFor the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. The hundreds digit is 8 only in 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds fours:89, hundreds eights:0.\n\nAdding up all fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nAdding up all eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 fours -98 eights=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 90, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me just go through it again quickly.\n\nUnits fours:49, units eights:49.\n\nTens fours:50, tens eights:49.\n\nHundreds fours:89, hundreds eights:0.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal eights:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in any page number up to 488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**\n\nSo, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484, totaling 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449, totaling 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488, totaling 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Wait, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Wait, let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. Correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " Each full hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, the last set is 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 =9). Each has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 more eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights) =90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Checking fours: units place: from 4,14,...484. How many terms? (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. 49+50+89=188. Correct. Eights: units place: 8,18,...488: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Correct. And in the tens place for eights, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. Correct. So, yes, the difference is 90.
