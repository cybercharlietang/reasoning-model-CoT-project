Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place (100s place):** The digit '4' appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences (488 - 400 + 1).\n\n   **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n   **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, that's correct. So, the total 8's in the tens place are 49. So, 49 units, 49 tens, 0 hundreds: 98. 4's: 49 units, 50 tens, 89 hundreds: 188. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but I just thought of something. When counting the hundreds place for 4's, 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. But when counting the tens place for 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers, which is correct because 488 is included. So, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the number of times each digit appears in each position. Another way to approach this is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position up to 488. Let me try that for units and tens places to confirm. For units place: For digits 0-9, each digit appears equally in the units place every 10 numbers. So, up to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 fours and 48 eights. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit cycles up to 8, so in the 49th group (481-490), but since we only go up to 488, the units digit goes up to 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once in each group, so 48 times, plus the 49th group where 4 appears once (at 484). Wait, but 484 is in the 48th group (481-490), but 488 is the end. So, maybe it's better to think of it as 488 divided by 10 is 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48 fours and 48 eights. But then, the last partial cycle is 481-488, which is 8 numbers: 481,482,...,488. In the units place, 481 has 1, 482 has 2, etc., up to 488. So, in this partial cycle, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units fours:48 +1=49, units eights:48 +1=49. That's consistent with my earlier count. Similarly, for the tens place: Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers. So, for 100 numbers, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. Now, up to 488, how many hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in the tens place, for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times. So, for 4 hundreds, each digit appears 4*10=40 times in the tens place. But wait, that's not exactly right because the last partial hundred (401-488) affects the count. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many times each digit appears in the tens place up to 488. Let me think again. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, for each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times. Now, up to 400, that's 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40 fours and 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0-8 (since 488 is 4 8 8). So, in this range, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in 401-488. The tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, 2 for 421-430, 3 for 431-440, 4 for 441-450, 5 for 451-460, 6 for 461-470, 7 for 471-480, and 8 for 481-488. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 450 is included, but 488 is the end. Wait, no, 441-450 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers. Similarly, the tens digit is 8 in 481-488, which is 8 numbers (481-488), so the tens digit is 8 in 8 numbers. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 10 numbers and 8 in 8 numbers. Therefore, total fours in tens place: 40 (from 1-400) +10=50. Eights in tens place:40 (from 1-400)+8=48. Wait, but earlier I thought the eights in tens place were 49. Hmm, now I'm getting a discrepancy. Let me check again. Wait, in the earlier approach, I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9), totaling 49. But in this approach, up to 400, it's 40 eights in the tens place, and in 401-488, it's 8 more, totaling 48. So, which is correct? Let me list all the tens places where 8 appears: - 80-89:10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, why is the other approach giving me 48? Let me see. When I broke it down into 1-400 and 401-488, from 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. So, that's correct. So, earlier when I thought of 401-488 as having 8 eights in the tens place, that's correct because 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place:40+9=49. So, in the earlier method, I was correct with 49 eights in the tens place. So, in the first approach, when I thought of 401-488 as contributing 8 eights, that was a mistake. It actually contributes 9 eights in the tens place. So, I must have miscounted earlier. Therefore, the correct count is 49 eights in the tens place. So, that brings the total eights to 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98. So, the initial count was correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that makes sense. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. For 4's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:98\n\nDifference:188-98=90. Yep, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes this time. So, the final answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 48.4 \u2192 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place in the range 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 48.8 \u2192 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = **49 times**.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Wait, but I'm a bit concerned because sometimes when counting digit occurrences, especially in higher digit positions, it's easy to miscount. Let me try another approach. Maybe I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position. For 4's: - Units: floor(488/10)=48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48, but since 488 is the last page, and 488 has a 8 in the units place, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units:49. - Tens: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, for 488 pages, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, no, 401-488: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's an additional 10. So, total tens place fours: 4*10 +10=50. Correct. - Hundreds: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Total 4's:49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, for 8's: - Units: floor(488/10)=48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus the 8 in 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units:49. - Tens: Each hundred has a set where the tens digit is 8, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such set has 10 numbers. How many such sets are there up to 488? Let's see: 80-89: yes, 10 numbers. 180-189: yes, 10. 280-289: yes, 10. 380-389: yes, 10. 480-488: since 488 is the last page, this set has 9 numbers (480-488). So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, so 4*10 +9=49. Correct. - Hundreds: As before, no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place up to 488. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct. Let me just think if there's any other way to approach this, maybe using a formula or a different counting method. Alternatively, I could calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position up to 488. For units place: For any digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place up to N is floor(N/10) + (1 if the units digit of N is >=d else 0). Wait, no, that's not quite accurate. Actually, for each digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place up to N is (N // 10) + (1 if N % 10 >= d else 0). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think. For example, up to 488, the number of 4's in the units place is the number of times 4 appears in 4,14,24,...,484. So, 484 is 48*10 +4, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, and then the 484 adds another, making 49. So, the formula would be (N - d) // 10 +1, where d is the digit. Wait, let's test that. For d=4, N=488. (488 -4)/10 +1 =484/10 +1=48.4 +1=49.4, which we take the floor, so 49. Correct. Similarly, for d=8, (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48 +1=49. Correct. So, that formula works for units place. For the tens place, the formula is a bit different. The number of times a digit d appears in the tens place up to N is calculated by considering higher digits and lower digits. Let me recall the formula: For the tens place, the count is (higher + 1) * 10 + (if the current digit is greater than d, add 10; else if equal, add (lower +1)). Hmm, maybe it's better to stick with the counting method I used earlier, as it's clearer for me. But just to be thorough, let me try applying the formula for the tens place. Let's take d=4 for the tens place. Let's break down N=488 into hundreds, tens, units: 4 (hundreds), 8 (tens), 8 (units). The formula for the number of times d appears in the tens place is:\n\n- higher = number formed by digits higher than the tens place, so higher = 4 (since the hundreds digit is 4).\n- current = the tens digit, which is 8.\n- lower = the units digit, which is 8.\n\nIf current > d: then the count is (higher +1) *10.\n\nIf current == d: then count is (higher) *10 + (lower +1).\n\nIf current < d: then count is higher *10.\n\nSo, for d=4, current=8 >4, so count = (4 +1)*10 =5*10=50. Which matches our earlier count of 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8 in the tens place:\n\nhigher=4, current=8, lower=8.\n\nSince current ==8, count = higher *10 + (lower +1) =4*10 + (8+1)=40 +9=49. Which matches our earlier count of 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, that formula works too. So, using that, we can confirm that the counts are correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 blocks: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 occurrences, and the last block contributes 9: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
