So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but wait, let me think again about the hundreds place for 8's. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so that's correct. Another way to check: total number of digits. Let's see, from 1-9: 9 numbers, each with 1 digit: 9 digits. From 10-99: 90 numbers, each with 2 digits: 180 digits. From 100-488: 389 numbers (since 488-100+1=389), each with 3 digits: 1167 digits. Total digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so total digits accounted for by 4's and 8's would be 188+98=286. But 286 is less than 1356, so that's okay, but maybe I'm overcomplicating.

    "text": " Wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Correct. - Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems right.

Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe I missed something, but I think it's correct. Let me check another way. Maybe using a formula or another method. For counting digits, a common approach is to consider each digit position separately and calculate how many times each digit appears. For a number with n digits, you can break it down into each place. So, for page numbers up to 488, which is a three-digit number, we can think of it as numbers from 001 to 488, padding with leading zeros to make them three digits. Then, for each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear. Let me try this approach for 4's. 1. **Units place:** For each complete set of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, up to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the incomplete set (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total units place 4's:48 +1=49. 2. **Tens place:** For each complete set of 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 ten times. So, in each 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. How many complete hundreds are there in 488? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 0-8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., 8 for 481-490. But since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 is present in 481-488, which is 8 numbers. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so 480-488 has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. But wait, I'm looking for 4's in the tens place in 401-488. The tens digit is 4 in 440-449. So, that's 10 numbers, but since 440-449 is within 401-488, that's 10 4's. So, total tens place 4's:40 (from complete hundreds) +10=50. 3. **Hundreds place:** For numbers 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. There are 89 numbers here (488-400+1=89). So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Adding up: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188. Same as before. For 8's: 1. **Units place:** Each 10 numbers, 8 appears once. Up to 488, that's 488/10=48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the incomplete set (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 8's:48+1=49. 2. **Tens place:** For each complete set of 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times, so 8 appears 10 times in each 100. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), contributing 4*10=40. In the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 9 more. So, total tens place 8's:40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** As before, there are no 8's in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, total 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we'll count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences except the last, which contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- More 4's than 8's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

Each block contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " Wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 5 sets of 10, which is 50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. Then, hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Total fours:49+50+89=188. That seems right. For the 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. So, 488 is the 49th term because (488-8)/10=48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 eights in units. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. And for the tens place, 50 fours. Units:49. So, 188 fours. For the eights, units:49, tens:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct. I think I might have initially thought it was 90, but I wanted to make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. So, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{484}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).  \n   - Number of blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449)  \n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.  \n   - Total occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     5 \\times 10 = 50\n     \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n     \\]\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 50 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 89 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\quad \\text{(since 488 is included, it's 49)}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).  \n   - Number of blocks: 5 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488)  \n   - The last block (480-488) has 9 numbers.  \n   - Total occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\n     \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: 0\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 49 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 0 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**  \n\\[\n188 - 98 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

Wait, no, in the tens place, 4 can appear in 40-49, 140-149, etc., but in the hundreds place, 4 is from 400-488. So, in the tens place, it's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Then hundreds place is 89.
