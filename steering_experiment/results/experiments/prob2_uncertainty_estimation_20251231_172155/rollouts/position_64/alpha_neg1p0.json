    "text": " That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. - Hundreds place: 400-488: 488 -400 +1=89. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: - Units:8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1=49. Correct. - Tens:80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98. Therefore, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I feel like that's a lot. Let me check another way. Maybe I can think of each digit position separately again. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a formula or a different counting method to verify. Another approach: For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear. Let's do that.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- For 4: The number of 4's in the units place is the number of complete decades (10 numbers) up to 488. Each decade contributes one 4. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, but wait, actually, from 0 to 488, the number of 4's in units place is floor(488/10) +1 if the last digit is >=4. Wait, no, more accurately, the number of times a specific digit appears in the units place is given by (n // 10) + (1 if the last digit is >= the target digit). Wait, perhaps a better formula is: For digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place up to number n is (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0). So, for 4:\n\nn=488, d=4.\n\nn//10=48, and 488%10=8 >=4, so 48 +1=49. So, 49 fours in units place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8:\n\nn=488, d=8.\n\nn//10=48, and 488%10=8 >=8, so 48 +1=49 eights in units place.\n\nWait, so that's consistent with my earlier count.\n\nNow, tens place:\n\nFor the tens place, the formula is a bit different. The number of times digit d appears in the tens place up to n is calculated as follows:\n\nLet higher = n // 100\n\ncurrent = (n //10) %10\n\nlower = n %10\n\nIf current > d: count += (higher +1) *10\n\nIf current == d: count += (higher)*10 + (lower +1)\n\nIf current < d: count += (higher)*10\n\nBut wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of blocks. Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is d. So, for each complete hundred, it's 10 times. Then, for the partial hundred, if the tens digit is d, we add the extra numbers.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula:\n\nFor the tens place, the number of times d appears is:\n\nhigher = n // 100\n\ncurrent = (n // 10) %10\n\nlower = n %10\n\nif current > d: count = (higher +1)*10\n\nelif current == d: count = higher*10 + (lower +1)\n\nelse: count = higher*10\n\nSo, let's apply this for d=4 and d=8.\n\nFirst, for 4 in tens place:\n\nn=488.\n\nhigher = 488 //100 =4\n\ncurrent = (488//10) %10 =48%10=8\n\nlower =488%10=8\n\nSince current=8 >4, so count = (4 +1)*10=5*10=50.\n\nSo, 50 fours in tens place. That matches my earlier count.\n\nFor 8 in tens place:\n\nd=8.\n\nhigher=4\n\ncurrent=8\n\nlower=8\n\nSince current=8 ==d=8, count = higher*10 + (lower +1)=4*10 + (8+1)=40 +9=49.\n\nSo, 49 eights in tens place. That also matches my earlier count.\n\nNow, for hundreds place:\n\nFor 4:\n\nn=488.\n\nThe hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488. So, the number of 4's in hundreds place is 488 -400 +1=89.\n\nFor 8:\n\nThe hundreds digit is 8 only in 800-899, but since n=488, there are 0 eights in hundreds place.\n\nSo, 89 fours and 0 eights in hundreds place.\n\nAdding up:\n\nFours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\nEights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so that's consistent. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought maybe 90 was a lot, but after checking with the formula, it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. Let's consider how many numbers have 4's and 8's in each position.\n\nBut I think the method I used is solid. So, the final answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference between their counts.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n\n   - **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n     - The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n     - The count is calculated as (488 // 10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - The digit 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n     - Each block of 100 contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n     - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488.\n     - Count: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n\n   - **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n     - The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n     - The count is (488 // 10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n     - Each block of 100 contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block which ends at 488.\n     - Count: 4 \u00d7 10 (for 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) + 9 (for 480-488) = 49.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n     - Count: 0.\n\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**\nThere are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
