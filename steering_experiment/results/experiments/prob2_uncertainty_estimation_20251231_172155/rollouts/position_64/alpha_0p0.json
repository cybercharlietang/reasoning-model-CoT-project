Wait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for 8's. From 80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in tens place. Similarly for 180-189, etc. But in the last set, 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 eights in the tens place. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, the total is 98 eights.

There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 occurrences.
