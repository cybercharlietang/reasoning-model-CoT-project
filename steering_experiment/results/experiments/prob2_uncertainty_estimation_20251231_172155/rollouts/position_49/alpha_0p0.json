That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct. For the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct too. For eights in the tens place, I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. Units place for eights: 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th term because (488-8)/10 +1=48.8, which is 48 full steps, plus 1 gives 49. So, that's correct. So, the difference is indeed 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be 90, but I'm not sure if I missed something. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 =89. So, that's correct. Each of those 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, I think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. There are 89 numbers in this range.\n\nTotal number of 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).

The first four ranges each contribute 10 numbers, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8, as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal number of 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** The number of 4's exceeds the number of 8's by 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
