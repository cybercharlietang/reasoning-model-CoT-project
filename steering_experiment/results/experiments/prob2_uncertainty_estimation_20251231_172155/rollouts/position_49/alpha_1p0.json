From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. And for eights, since the book ends at 488, there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0. So, the difference is 90. Yeah, I think that's right.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding how many more 4's are printed than 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488 (9 numbers). Total: 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
