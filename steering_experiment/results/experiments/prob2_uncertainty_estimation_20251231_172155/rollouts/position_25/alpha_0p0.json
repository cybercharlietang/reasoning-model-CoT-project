    "text": " That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 5 blocks are within 488. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens and then 8 in the units place, making it the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers, since 488-480+1=9). So, let's count each block: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours from units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Wait, let me double-check that addition: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Yep, that's correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's the 49th multiple of 10. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page. So, each block except the last one has 10 numbers, but the last block (480-488) has 9 numbers. Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no hundreds digits of 8 in this book. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights from units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Wait, let me check that: 49+49=98, correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9 (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. So, 48 full tens, meaning 48 occurrences, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set. So, how many blocks? Each block is 10 numbers.

Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many that is. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but our book goes up to 488, so 480-488 would have 8 in the tens place. Let me count how many sets there are. Each hundred block (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, that's 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1=9.

So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds =49 +49 +0=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90.

So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units:49. Tens place: Each hundred block has 10, and there are 5 blocks (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449). So, 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. The last number is 488, which is 488. So, how many terms? The first term is 8, last term is 488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many full blocks and the partial one. Each full block (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 4*10=40 eights. Then, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, that's 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that's 90. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me double-check the counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I feel like that's a lot. Let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. And for eights, the tens place: 4 full blocks (80-89, etc.) each 10, so 4*10=40, plus 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49. Units place: 49 eights. So, total eights: 49+49=98. Fours: 188. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Count the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. This totals 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - More 4's than 8's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 5 sets (40-49, 140-149, etc.) each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds place is 4 only for numbers from 400 to 488, which is indeed 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is the last set. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last block which goes up to 488. Let me count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 4 appears in 400-488.  \n   - This is 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.  \n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences except the last, which has 9.  \n   - Total: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in counting the units place for fours. Let me check again. Units place: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 4,14,24,...,484. To find how many, take (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. That's correct. For eights in the units place: 8,18,...,488. So, same calculation: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place for fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, 5 sets, so 50. Correct. Tens place for eights:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. The first four sets are 10 each, the last set from 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 4*10=40, +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: fours from 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Eights in hundreds place: none, since 488 is less than 800. So, total fours:188, eights:98. Difference:188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. But wait, let me confirm: 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5*10=50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me think: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 188 fours. Now, let me check if I did that correctly. Units: 4,14,24,...,484: that's 484/10 +1=49. Tens: each hundred has 10, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only part of the fifth hundred. So, does that affect the count? Wait, no, because in the tens place, each hundred block (like 1-100) has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. So, from 1-400, that's 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit can be 4 again in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens fours: 40+10=50, which matches my earlier count. Now, hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Okay, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many 8's in the units place? Let's see, the first is 8, then every 10 numbers. The last one is 488. So, how many terms in this sequence? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 +10(n-1)=488. So, 10(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts because 90 seems high. Let me go through each digit place again. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total:188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total:98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct. For eights, in the tens place, I had 49. Wait, but when counting the tens place eights, I considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. Let me see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. Units place for eights: from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers. So, 488 is the last one. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units:49, tens:49, total eights:98. So, fours:188, eights:98. So, difference is 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a big difference. Let me think if I missed anything. Wait, in the hundreds place for fours, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. For eights, in the hundreds place, there are none. So, that's correct. Now, another way to check: perhaps I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position again. Let me try that.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units place: numbers ending with 4 from 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours.\n\n- Tens place: in each hundred, 40-49, 140-149,...,440-449. Each block of 100 has 10 fours in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 blocks (1-100,101-200,201-300,301-400), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens fours:40+10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units place: numbers ending with 8 from 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49.\n\n- Tens place: numbers where tens digit is 8: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, total tens eights:40+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: no numbers from 800-899, so 0.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that's consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (4, 14, 24, ..., 484):**\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449):**\n   - Each hundred block (e.g., 1-100, 101-200) contributes 10 fours in the tens place.\n   - From 1-400: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - From 401-488: 10 fours in 440-449.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (400-488):**\n   - Numbers from 400 to 488: 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (8, 18, 28, ..., 488):**\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488):**\n   - Each hundred block (e.g., 1-100, 101-200) contributes 10 eights in the tens place.\n   - From 1-400: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - From 401-488: 9 eights in 480-488.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No numbers from 800-899 in a 488-page book.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take the integer part, which is 48, but including 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also count? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. So, let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check that again. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours than eights, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so it's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The formula is floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48. But wait, when I count from 4 to 484, stepping by 10, it's 48 steps, but the count is 49 numbers because it includes both endpoints. Wait, no, actually, the number of times a digit appears in the units place is floor((N + 9 - digit)/10). So, for 4 in units place: floor((488 + 9 - 4)/10) = floor(493/10) = 49. So, 49 fours in the units place. Similarly, for tens place: the number of times 4 appears in the tens place is floor((488 + 10 - 4)/100) = floor(494/100) = 4, but each time it's 10 numbers, so 4*10=40, but wait, that's not matching my earlier count. Hmm, maybe I should use a different approach. Alternatively, for the tens place, the number of times 4 appears is determined by how many complete groups of 100 there are, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. From 1-400, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8, so the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, but wait, 401-488 includes 400-409? No, 401-488 starts at 401, so the tens digit 4 occurs from 400-409, but since we're starting at 401, it's 401-409, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place from 401-488, we have 9 fours. So, total tens place fours: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 50. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount. From 1-400: each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. From 401-488: the tens digit is 0 (401-409), but wait, no, 401-488: the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, but since we're starting at 401, it's 401-409, which is 9 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 9 fours. So total tens fours: 40 + 9 = 49. So, units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 89 (from 400-488). Wait, no, hundreds place is 4 in 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, total fours: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187 fours. Hmm, that's different from my initial 188. So, which is correct? Let me think again. Maybe I overcounted in the tens place. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a formula to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position. The formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the i-th position (units, tens, hundreds) in numbers from 1 to N is as follows:\n\nFor the units place:\ncount = (N // 10) * 1 + min(max(N % 10 - d + 1, 0), 10)\n\nFor the tens place:\ncount = (N // 100) * 10 + min(max(N % 100 - d*10 + 10, 0), 10)\n\nSimilarly for higher places.\n\nBut maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, let's use a systematic approach.\n\nCalculating the number of 4's:\n\n1. Units place:\nNumbers where the units digit is 4: 4,14,24,...,484.\n\nHow many such numbers? The sequence starts at 4 and ends at 484, with a common difference of 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 =49. So, 49 fours in the units place.\n\n2. Tens place:\nNumbers where the tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n\nEach block contributes 10 numbers. How many such blocks are there?\n\nFrom 1-488, the blocks are:\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249:10\n- 340-349:10\n- 440-449:10\n\nThat's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so it's valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\nNumbers where the hundreds digit is 4: 400-488.\n\nHow many numbers? 488 - 400 +1 =89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal fours: 49 +50 +89= 188.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 187, but now it's 188. I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 49 in the tens place. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the tens place, from 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. So, total fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. Units place:\nNumbers ending with 8:8,18,28,...,488.\n\nHow many? The sequence starts at 8, ends at 488, step 10.\n\nNumber of terms: ((488 -8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. Tens place:\nNumbers where the tens digit is 8:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389.\n\nEach block contributes 10 numbers. How many blocks?\n\nFrom 1-488, the blocks are:\n-80-89:10\n-180-189:10\n-280-289:10\n-380-389:10\n\nThat's 4 blocks, each with 10, so 4*10=40 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, does 480-489 have a tens digit of 8? Yes, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 includes 480-488, which is 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, we have an additional 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, total tens place eights:40 (from 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) +9 (from 480-488)=49.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\nNumbers where the hundreds digit is 8:800-899. But the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nWait, let me verify the tens place again. From 1-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in:\n\n-80-89:10\n-180-189:10\n-280-289:10\n-380-389:10\n-480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, that's 4 full blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nSo, total eights:49+49=98.\n\nNow, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours. Let me recount the fours:\n\nUnits place:4,14,...,484:49 numbers.\n\nTens place:40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449:5 blocks of 10, so 50.\n\nHundreds place:400-488:89 numbers.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nEights:\n\nUnits:8,18,...,488:49.\n\nTens:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488:4 full blocks (each 10) and one partial block of 9, so 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds:0.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. There are 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers from 800-899, so 0 occurrences.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. Let's calculate: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but our book goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, let's count how many blocks: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's.

    "text": " That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50 fours. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers in 440-449 are included. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? Well, 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. Wait, but wait: 488 is the last page. So, 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? Let's see: The first term is 8 (which is 8*1), and the last term is 488 (which is 8*61). So, from 1 to 61 multiples of 8. So, 61 times. Wait, that can't be right because 8*61=488, so that's correct. So, units place has 61 eights. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 49, but now I'm getting 61. Let me check again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so in 488 pages, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's the number of times 8 is the last digit, which is every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. So, the number of terms is floor(488/10) +1 if 488 mod 10 is 8. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, and 488 mod 10 is 8, so we add 1, making it 49. Wait, but 8*61=488, so that would imply 61 numbers ending with 8, but that's not correct because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers, not 61. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. Each set of 10 numbers has exactly one number ending with 8. So, from 1 to 488, how many sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. That's 48. Then, the last partial set is 481-488, which includes 488, so that's one more. So, total is 48 +1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. Wait, but earlier I thought of 8*61=488, which would mean 61 numbers, but that's incorrect because 8*61 is 488, but the numbers ending with 8 are 8,18,28,...,488, which is indeed 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th term. Wait, 8*1=8, 8*2=16, but wait, 16 doesn't end with 8. Wait, no, I'm confusing multiples of 8 with numbers ending with 8. So, numbers ending with 8 are 8,18,28,38,...,488. Each of these is 8 more than a multiple of 10. So, the nth number is 10n -2, where n starts at 1. So, when does 10n -2 <=488? 10n <=490, so n<=49. So, n=1 to 49, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8. This happens in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place contributes 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n   - Each full block contributes 10 occurrences, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 +89=188 fours in total. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488.

Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last block, which only goes up to 488, contributing 9. So, let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So that's 4 blocks with 10 eights and 1 block with 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, contributes 9 eights.

    "text": " That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 occurrences (since 488 is included). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last block. Each full block (like 80-89) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, how many full blocks are there? From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Yes, that's correct. For the tens place of 4's, I had 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Units place: 49 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's, units: 49, tens:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This is 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488.

So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. Let's see: 8,18,...,488. That's from 8 to 488 with a step of 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except possibly the last block. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens: 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units:49, tens:49. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, when counting the hundreds place for 4's, I considered 400-488 as 89 numbers. Let me check: 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. Yes, correct. For the tens place in 8's, I had 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct. So, the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Let me count how many blocks. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10). So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So yes, 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, let me check again. Units: 49, tens: 49, so total 98.

So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 499, but since the book stops at 488, it's only up to 488. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.

Wait, let me count: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place for 480-488. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=40+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me double-check: from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, yes, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. 488 is the last page, so it's included. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers add one 8 in the units place. So, from 8 to 488, how many? Let me calculate: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is the last number, so units digit 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488. The number of such numbers is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Wait, but 488 is 488, so 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last number, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, so 4*10=40, and the last block contributes 9. So, total eights in tens place: 40 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98 eights. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=90. Hmm, but wait, when counting the hundreds place for fours, I considered 400-488 as 89 numbers. Let me confirm that: 488 -400 +1=89. Yes, that's correct. For the tens place in fours, I had 5 blocks of 10, which is correct: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5*10=50. For eights in the tens place, I had 4 full blocks (80-89, etc.) contributing 10 each, and then 480-488 contributing 9, totaling 49. That seems correct. Units place for both digits: 49 each, so that's okay. So, the total fours are 188, eights are 98. So, 188-98=90.

How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be the next set, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of this. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count how many complete blocks there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4 x 10 = 40. Now, the next block would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, in the tens place, how many eights? From 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so that's 9 more. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8 in this book. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. How many terms? The formula is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Wait, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, for the tens place, we have 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 10 each, and then 480-488 contributing 9. So, that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds = 49 +49 +0=98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. So, 188 -98=90.

Let's count each block. Each block from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: each contributes 10 numbers. But 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488).

Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is included, so let me check how many numbers that is. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. How many terms?

But the book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many sets. Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total tens place eights: 4x10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That looks right. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.

From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 full sets (4\u00d710=40) plus 9 in the last partial set. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the Digit 4:**\n1. **Units Place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). This results in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens Place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the Digit 8:**\n1. **Units Place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488), totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens Place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488 (9 numbers), totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. So, from 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. That's correct. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). So, 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The first is 8, last is 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets with 10 each and 1 set with 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4*10 +9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, fours:188, eights:98. Difference:188-98=90.

Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.

So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98.

So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because when considering the hundreds place, it's actually the hundreds digit, so each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, the count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many terms? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but 488 is the 49th term because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let me count how many blocks there are. Each block is 10 numbers, so from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, total eights in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.

    "text": " That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me check: 488 - 8 = 480, so 480/10 = 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the last block. Let's count how many blocks: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total eights in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n  \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since pages go up to 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = **98**.\n\nDifference: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 blocks of 10 numbers each, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers gives one 8 in the units place. So, from 8 to 488, that's 49 numbers (since 488 is the 49th occurrence). So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, each block except the last has 10 numbers, and the last block has 9 numbers (480-488). Let me count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total.

So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.

Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, does 488 count? Yes, because the book has 488 pages. So, how many such numbers are there? The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find the count, I can do (488 - 8)/10 + 1. That's (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many numbers have 8 in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-489 would be 10, but we only go up to 488, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers). So, the first four blocks give 4*10=40, and the last block gives 9. So, total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.
