    "text": " That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, does 400 count? Yes, because 400 is included. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these 89 numbers. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the last occurrence is at 488, which is the 49th number. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Each full set (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4\u00d710=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through the counts again. **Counting 4's:**\n- Units: 4,14,...,484. The last number is 484, which is the 49th occurrence because (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 fours.\n- Tens: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5\u00d710=50. That seems correct.\n- Hundreds: 400-488. 488 -400 +1 =89. So, 89 fours.\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188. That checks out.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- Units: 8,18,...,488. The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because (488 -8)/10 +1 =480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights.\n- Tens: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four contributes 10, so 4\u00d710=40. The last one, 480-488, is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 40+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place.\n- Hundreds: None, since 800-899 isn't part of the book. So, 0.\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 fours -98 eights=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check if I counted correctly for the hundreds place in 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers. So, yes, 89 fours there. And for 8's, in the hundreds place, there are none. So, yes, 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " That's 5 sets of 10, so 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Wait, let me double-check that addition: 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 +89 is 188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the units digit. So, starting from 8, each set of 10 numbers adds one 8 in the units place. The number of such numbers is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many numbers in each set. Each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, contributing 10 eights each. The last set, 480-488, has 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, the tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

    "text": " That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400-488 includes 400, 401, ..., 488. So, that's 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Hmm, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. So, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last occurrence is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? Each set contributes 10 eights except possibly the last one. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, so 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place contributes 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Wait, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Similarly, for units place, 4 appears in 4,14,24,...,484. Let's check how many numbers that is. The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, from 4 to 484, how many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, that's correct. Similarly, in the tens place, 40-49,140-149, etc., each block contributes 10, and there are 5 blocks (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449). So, 5*10=50. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. For eights, units place:8,18,...,488. That's (488 -8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place eights:49. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four contributes 10, and the last contributes 9, so 4*10 +9=49. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = \\frac{480}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   5 \\times 10 = 50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in 400-488.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n   \\]\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 50 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 89 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = \\frac{480}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.  \n   The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   4 \\times 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   0\n   \\]\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 49 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 0 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**  \n\\[\n188 - 98 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds place has 89 fours. Wait, no. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but our book stops at 488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. How many numbers? (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but our book stops at 488, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights, subtract the total eights from total fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that can't be right because I think I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me double-check the hundreds place for fours. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, as I thought. So, 89 fours there. Units place for fours: 49, tens place:50, so total fours:49+50+89=188. Eights: units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm not sure if I counted correctly for the tens place in fours. Let me check again. For fours in the tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50 fours. Correct. For eights in the tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49. Correct. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm getting 90, but I think I might have made a mistake because I recall that in some cases, the last set might not complete. Let me check the units place for fours again. From 4 to 484, stepping by 10: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10=484. So, 10(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in the units place. Correct. Similarly, for eights in units place: 8,18,...,488. Last term is 488. So, 8 + (n-1)*10=488. 10(n-1)=480, n-1=48, n=49. Correct. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. So, 89 fours there. So, 49+50+89=188. Eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. But wait, I think I might have missed something. Let me recount the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488-400+1=89.

Wait, no: 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 in 480-488 is 9 numbers? Wait, no, because 480-489 is 10 numbers, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers? Wait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480 is the first, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, for 480-488, that's 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, total for tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and 9 numbers in 480-488. So, that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " That's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488. Let me calculate how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? That's (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also count? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 would be part of this. Let me calculate how many numbers have 8 in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, so 4*10=40. But wait, 480-488 is another set where the tens digit is 8. From 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's an additional 9 eights in the tens place. So total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's.

Let's count how many blocks. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the first four blocks give 4 x 10 = 40, and the last block gives 9. So, total tens place eights = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights = 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, to find how many more fours than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when counting the tens place for eights, I had 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. Let me recount that. From 80-89:10 eights. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, fours are 188, eights are 98. Difference is 90. So, 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly for fours.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 occurrences. Wait, but does 488 count as the 49th? Let's check: 8,18,...,488. The first is 8, and the last is 488, which is the 49th number. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8. Let's count each block: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, that's correct. For eights in the tens place, I had 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. Units place for eights: 8,18,...,488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the last one is 488, which is the 49th. So that's correct. So, total fours 188, eights 98, difference 90. Wait, but I'm getting 90, but I thought the answer might be different. Let me check another way. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that in the hundreds place, fours appear in 400-488, which is 89 times, as I did. But maybe I should check the tens place again. For fours in the tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So 5 blocks of 10, which is 50. So that's correct. So, 50 in tens, 49 in units, 89 in hundreds: 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0: 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm wondering if I'm missing something. Let me try another approach: count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately, and sum them up. Alternatively, maybe I can write a small program or use a formula, but since I'm doing this manually, let's proceed carefully. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the number of times each digit appears in each position. For units place: For any digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor(n/10) + (1 if the units digit of n is >=d else 0). Wait, but I think I've already considered that by counting 49 for both 4 and 8. Let me check for 4 in units place: The last number is 488. So, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488/10=48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, and then the 0.8 part means the 49th occurrence is at 484, which is within 488. So, 49 fours in units. Similarly for 8: 488/10=48.8, so 48 full cycles, and the 49th occurrence is at 488. So, 49 eights in units. Now, for tens place: The formula is similar but for tens. The number of times a digit d appears in the tens place is floor(n/100)*10 + extra, where extra is the number of complete decades in the current hundred. Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of hundreds. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times. So, for each hundred, the digit d appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 488 pages, how many hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. So, for the tens digit, each hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, for fours in tens place: 4 hundreds *10=40, plus the tens in 401-488. From 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8 in 401-409, then 1-8 in 410-419, etc. Wait, perhaps it's easier to think that in 400-488, the tens digit runs from 0-8 in 400-409, 10-19 in 410-419, etc., up to 80-89 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, in the tens place for 400-488, how many times does 4 appear? Only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total fours in tens place: 4*10=40 (from 1-400) plus 10 (from 440-449) = 50. Similarly, for eights in tens place: in each hundred, 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds *10=40, plus in 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, total eights in tens place: 40+9=49. That matches my earlier count. For hundreds place: fours appear in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, as I calculated. Eights in hundreds place: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 188. Total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Difference: 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm getting 90, but I thought maybe the answer was 90. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again: from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, that's correct. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Eights:49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. But I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to miscount. Let me try another approach: calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position. For units place: For each digit from 0-9, each digit appears equally in the units place except possibly the last partial set. For 488 pages, units digit cycles 48 full times (48*10=480), and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, for units digit 4: in each full cycle, 4 appears once. So, 48 times. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once more (484). So, total units 4's:48+1=49. Similarly, units 8's: in each full cycle, 8 appears once, so 48 times. In the last 8 numbers, 8 appears once (488). So, total units 8's:48+1=49. For tens place: Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred. So, for 488 pages, there are 4 full hundreds (1-400), and then 88 pages (401-488). In each full hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times, so each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 full hundreds, each digit appears 4*10=40 times in the tens place. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit runs from 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for the tens digit, how many times does 4 appear? From 400-409: tens digit is 0. 410-419: tens digit 1. ... 440-449: tens digit 4. So, in 440-449, that's 10 numbers, so 10 times. Then, after that, from 450-488, the tens digits are 5-8, but we're only interested in 4. So, in the partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, total tens 4's:40+10=50. Similarly, for tens 8's: in each full hundred, 10 times. So, 4*10=40. In the partial hundred, 480-488: tens digit 8, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, tens 8's:40+9=49. For hundreds place: 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. 8 appears in hundreds place only in 800-899, which is beyond 488, so 0 times. So, adding up: fours:49 (units)+50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188. Eights:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98. Difference:188-98=90. So, I think 90 is the correct answer. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I remember sometimes when counting digits, especially in programming, you have to be careful with off-by-one errors. Let me check the units place again. For 488 pages, the units digit cycles 48 full times (1-480), and then 481-488. So, in each full cycle, 4 appears once in units place, so 48 times. In the last 8 numbers, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once more at 484. So, 49 total. Similarly for 8: in each full cycle, 8 appears once, so 48 times, and in the last 8 numbers, 8 appears once at 488. So, 49 total. That's correct. For tens place: in each full hundred, 10 times for each digit. So, 4 full hundreds give 40 times for each digit in tens place. Then, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0-8. For 4 in tens place, it's 440-449:10 numbers. For 8 in tens place, it's 480-488:9 numbers. So, 40+10=50 for fours, 40+9=49 for eights. That's correct. Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. So, total fours 188, eights 98. Difference 90. I think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place (1-488):** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens place (1-488):** The digit 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).

    "text": " That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, 8 appears in 8,18,...,488. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds another 8. How many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Wait, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's count each set. - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189:10. - 280-289:10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488:9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers with 8 in units place? The total number is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), not 10.

So, total tens place eights are 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total eights are units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " That's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place gives us 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers.

Wait, does 480-489 fall within the 488-page limit? 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, the last number is 488, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers. So, how many sets? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 full sets (each 10) and one partial set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me count how many blocks there are. Each block from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, but the last block (480-488) has only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers). So, for the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4*10=40, plus the last block 480-488 which has 9 eights (since 480,481,...,488: 9 numbers). So total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 0. Wait, no: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The nth term is 8 + 10(n-1). Let's find n when the term is 488. 8 + 10(n-1) = 488 \u2192 10(n-1) = 480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is included, but 480-489 is also included, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of the tens place as 8. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, so in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 from 480-489, but the book stops at 488, so that's 9 numbers: 480-488. So, the tens place counts as 10 + 10 +10 +10 +9? Wait, no, because each hundred block up to 400-499 would have 10, but since we only go up to 488, the last block is only 9. So, let me list them: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, that seems off. Wait, 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens eights: 40+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. Let's see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, I need to do the same for the digit 8. Let's count the number of 8's in each place. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many numbers that is. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. Wait, let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 8, 18, ..., 488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488 => 10(n-1) = 480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, the last set is 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. Let's count how many 8's in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last block, which is only 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, for the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributes 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, the last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, no, let me check again. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 eights in the tens place for that last block. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

Well, from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds places with 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

    "text": " That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but wait a second, the hundreds place is only 4 in numbers from 400-488, which is correct. So, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but wait, let me check again because I might have made a mistake. Wait, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. So total fours are 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block, which only goes up to 488. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10). So, that's 4 blocks with 10 each and one block with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: number of 4's (188) minus number of 8's (98) equals 90. Wait, but wait, let me double-check my calculations because I think I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the fours and eights again. For fours: units place: from 4,14,24,...,484. That's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct. For eights: units place: 8,18,28,...,488. That's (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So that's 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total eights:49 +49=98. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any numbers. For example, in the hundreds place for fours, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is correct because 488 -400 +1=89. For eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So that's correct. So, I think my calculation is right. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in page numbers 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? Let's see: 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Therefore, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is included, so it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, let's count how many sets of 100 we have. From 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, total tens place eights: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

Therefore, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are.

Let's calculate: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9.

So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, the hundreds place has 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, each number has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours. Units place: from 1-488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1 four, so 48 fours, and then in the 489th number, which is 488, the units digit is 8, so the last four in the units place is 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 fours. Tens place: from 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 fours, so 5\u00d710=50 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th number because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 8, so from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. Wait, no, wait. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for eights. Let me check the tens place again. The ranges are 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. Similarly, for fours in the tens place, it's 5 sets of 10, so 50. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, it's included. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let's see how many tens blocks that is. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 =9). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers because 488 - 480 =8, so 8+1=9. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, contributes 9 eights. So total eights in tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits with 8. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

For hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place: 4,14,...,484. 484 is 48*10 +4, so 49 numbers. Correct. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is 48*10 +8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct. So, 188 fours and 98 eights. Difference is 90.

So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is included, so from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, how many numbers? Let me calculate: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let me count each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: Here, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4\u00d710=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of eights is 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with the counts. Let me verify the fours again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 0 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block is 10, and there are 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). So, 5\u00d710=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. Correct. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10, so 4\u00d710=40. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none. So, total eights: 49+49=98. Therefore, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " That's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds place has 89 fours. Wait, but 400-488 includes all the numbers where the hundreds digit is 4, right? So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, let me add up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 is included. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. Each hundred has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Now, the next set would be 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's an additional 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within the book. Since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is included, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but in the tens place, it's 80-89, which is 10 numbers, but 480-489 would be another 10, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9 numbers. Wait, no, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. Wait, no, 480 is the first, then 481, ..., up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Wait, but 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, the last number is 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, each block of 100 contributes 10 eights in the tens place except the last block, which contributes 9. Let me list them: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total eights in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the total eights from total fours: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that can't be right because I think I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for eights. Let me double-check the tens place for eights. When I was counting the tens place, I considered 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights because the book ends at 488. So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That seems correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Fours are 188. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in units? The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 after that. So, the number of times is floor(488 / 10) + 1 if the last number is beyond 488. Wait, 488 / 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. But the last 4 in units is at 484, which is 484 - 4 = 480, so 480 / 10 = 48, plus 1 gives 49. So, units place: 49. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. From 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, each block contributes 10 numbers, except the last one. Let's see: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place: 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. For the tens place, I considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9. So total is 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct. So, 49 eights in tens place. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total eights: 98. Fours: 188. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Now, adding up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8 is the units digit in 8,18,...,488. Let me count: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with tens digit 8. Let's count how many such blocks we have. From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189:10. From 200-299:280-289:10. From 300-399:380-389:10. From 400-488:480-488: that's 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Wait, no: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book stops at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, and the last block contributing 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me double-check.

So, adding up: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) gives 4*10=40, plus the 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488.

Let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 blocks with 10 each and one block with 9. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks have 10 each, and the last block has 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
