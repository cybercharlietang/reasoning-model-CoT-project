    "text": " Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 actually have 10 fours in the tens place? Yes, because each number from 440 to 449 has a 4 in the tens place. So, that's 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. Wait, but wait, 488 is the 49th number? Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first is 8, which is the 8th number, but when counting how many times 8 appears in the units place, it's every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's the same as the number of times 8 appears in the units place up to 488. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, and then the 49th is 488, which is another 8. So, total units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set. Let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Hmm, but wait, does 440-449 include 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but let's check the last number: 488 is included, so how many numbers? Starting from 8, 18, ..., 488. The count is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let me count how many sets of 100 have the tens digit as 8. Each set is 10 numbers, so 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 +9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my counting to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The formula is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets is 10, last set is 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks have 10 each, and the last has 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So 5*10=50 fours. Wait, but let me check the last block: 440-449 is 10 numbers, so yes, 50 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing an 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place, except the last block, which only goes up to 488. So, from 0-400: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 eights in the tens place. So total eights in tens place: 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, totaling 5 blocks.\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 eights each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. So that's 5*10=50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up the hundreds, tens, and units: 89 (hundreds) +50 (tens) +49 (units) = 188 fours. Now, let me check if I did that correctly. Wait, 4 in the hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. Tens place: 5 sets of 10, correct. Units place: 49, which I think is correct because from 4,14,...,484, which is 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. So, total fours: 89+50+49=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. So, starting at 8 and going up by 10 each time. The last number is 488. So, how many terms? The first term is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, how many sets? Each set is 10 numbers. Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, total 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me double-check the counts. For fours: units place had 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly for the tens place in fours? I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Let me list them: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, so 50 fours in the tens place, correct. And for the units place, 49 fours, correct. And hundreds place, 89 fours, correct. For eights: units place 49, correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49, correct. So, total eights 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling:  \n   \\[\n   5 \\times 10 = 50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n   \\]\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 50 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 89 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   The first four ranges each contribute 10 occurrences, and the last range contributes 9.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book has only 488 pages.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   0\n   \\]\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 49 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 0 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**  \n\\[\n188 - 98 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, that's 5 blocks of 10, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, let me check the last block: 440-449 is 10 numbers, yes. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours from units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th number because 488 /10 = 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the last block. Each full block (like 80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) give 4*10=40 eights. Then, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, we have 40 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, but wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

    "text": " Wait, does 440-449 fit within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's 5 blocks of 10 numbers each, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up the fours in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. Let's see how many numbers that is. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10 each time. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count each block. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks with 10 each and one block with 9. So, 4*10 = 40, plus 9 is 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm. For each hundred, like 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 101-200: 140-149, another 10. So up to 400-499, but since our book stops at 488, the last block is 440-449, which is still within 488. So 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but let me check: each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So yes, 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor the fours:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the eights:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. That seems correct too.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more fours than eights.

So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many full sets we have. The first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights in the tens place. The last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 in 9 of these. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights = 98.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times.

    "text": " Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is the fifth set, and 440 is 440, which is within 488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, the last occurrence is at 488. How many such numbers? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. To find how many, I can do (488 - 8)/10 + 1. That's (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Let me check how many sets there are. Each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers (480 to 488). So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This is every 10th number, starting at 4 and ending at 484.\n   - Number of 4's: \\( \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Number of 4's: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - This is 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n   - Number of 4's: 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This is every 10th number, starting at 8 and ending at 488.\n   - Number of 8's: \\( \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, except the last block (480-488), which contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Number of 8's: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - There are no page numbers in the hundreds place with 8 (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Number of 8's: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's 5 blocks of 10, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check the last block: 440-449. The next block would be 540-549, but 540 is beyond 488, so that doesn't count. So yes, 5 blocks, 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is included, right? So, how many such numbers? The last number is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the blocks are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488. Wait, but 401-488 is only 88 numbers, so does the tens digit 8 occur in 480-488? Yes, that's 9 numbers: 480-488, but the tens digit is 8 for all these, so that's 9 numbers. Wait, but earlier blocks: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, total eights in the tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10*4=40 plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Let me recount the tens place because I might have miscounted. Wait, when considering the tens place, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 +9=49. So, that's correct. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Wait, but earlier I thought the hundreds place had 0, so total eights are 98. Wait, but let me check again: units place 49, tens place 49, so 98 eights. Now, the number of fours was 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place, I had 49, which is correct because from 4 to 484, stepping by 10, that's (484-4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Tens place: 5 blocks of 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89. 49+50=99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units place, 49. Tens place: 49. So, 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again: when counting the units place for fours, I included 484, which is correct. For the tens place, I had 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. For hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. That adds up correctly. For eights, units place is 49, tens place is 49, so 98. So, yes, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (Ones Place):** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). \n     - The number of such occurrences is calculated by dividing 484 by 10, which gives 48.4. Taking the integer part and adding 1 gives 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n     - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences. There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '4' appears in all numbers from 400-488.\n     - This range includes 89 numbers, contributing 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n     - The number of such occurrences is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n     - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences. There are 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and a partial block (480-488) contributing 9 occurrences, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '8' does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 count as 10 numbers? Yes, because 440 is included and 449 is the last one. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, does 488 count? Yes, because 488 is the last page. So, how many numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but the last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is valid. So, each block of 100 has 10 eights in the tens place. How many such blocks? From 1-488, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 eights in the tens place. Then, in 401-488, the tens place is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them. So, for the tens place, we have 4*10=40 eights from the complete hundreds, plus 9 eights from 480-488. So total eights in tens place: 40+9=49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so that's 9 eights. So total tens place eights: 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to miscount.\n\nWait, for the units place of 4's: I thought from 4,14,...484, which is 49 numbers. Let me confirm: The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 numbers after that. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10 => 480 = (n-1)*10 => n-1=48 => n=49. So yes, 49 fours in units place.\n\nFor tens place of 4's: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and how many blocks? From 0-99: 40-49, that's one block. Then 100-199: 140-149, another block. 200-299:240-249. 300-399:340-349. 400-488:440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89. So total fours: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor eights:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,...,488. How many? 488 is 8 + 48*10, so 49 numbers. Correct.\n\nTens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 eights. The last block, 480-488, is 9 numbers, each with 8 in tens place. So 4*10=40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: none, since 800+ is beyond 488. So 0.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nThus, 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the number of times the digit 4 appears in page numbers from 1 to 488 and comparing it to the number of times 8 appears.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This gives 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.

So 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488, so the units digit is 8. So, how many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full steps, but including 488, that's 49 numbers.

Wait, no: 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place. Let's see: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, does that mean the last block only has 9 eights in the tens place? Let me think: from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, right? Because 480 is 4 8 0, 481 is 4 8 1, ..., up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 in 480-488. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400 is included, right? So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of fours is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. So, 484 is the last one. So, how many numbers? The formula is (last - first)/step +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. So, 49 fours in units. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. From 1-100: 40-49 (10), 101-200:140-149 (10), 201-300:240-249 (10), 301-400:340-349 (10), and 401-488:440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. So, 50 fours in tens place. Hundreds place: From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 +50 +89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many 8's in units place? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, using the formula: (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 =48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, how many sets? Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers:480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we stop at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four sets (80-89, etc.) each have 10 eights in the tens place, and the last set has 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in the following ranges: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, yes, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in hundreds place. Therefore, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in hundreds place. Yes. And for eights, hundreds place is 0. So, yes, 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but wait, let me check the tens place for eights again. When I counted the tens place eights, I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). That's 10*4=40 plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. Units place: 49 eights. So, 98 total eights. Fours: 188. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. I think I'm confident with that answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Each range contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such ranges:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 10 = 50\n   \\]\n   So, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488.

Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8*61=488, but wait, no. Let me think differently. The first 8 is at 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. Solving for n: (n-1)*10 = 480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be another set, but since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many full sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, so: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 full sets (each 10) and one partial set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488.

Wait, but let me double-check: 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? The first is 8, and the last is 488. Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, not 10). So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, etc.) each contribute 10 eights, and the last set contributes 9. So total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10=40 plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98.

So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers contributes a 4. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? If I divide 488 by 10, I get 48.8. So, the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 488 count as one occurrence? Yes, because 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, let's count how many sets of 10 numbers have 8 in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total:49+50=99+89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total:98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm wondering if I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. That seems correct. For the tens place, I had 50 fours, which is correct because each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is part of the 400-499 block, but since we stop at 488, does that affect the count? Wait, no, because in the tens place, 40-49 is in the first hundred, 140-149 in the second, etc., up to 440-449, which is in the 400-499 block. So, 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. That seems correct. For the eights, in the tens place, I had 49 because the last set was 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 49 total. That seems correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because starting from 8 (which is the first), each 10 numbers adds one more, so 488 is the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 full blocks (each 10) and one partial block with 9. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

So, 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of fours is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but including 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Therefore, total number of eights is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: Units:49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total 188.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.

So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

That seems right. For eights in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct.

The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but we have to check if 488 is included. 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488.

Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 9 from the last block, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so that's 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8.

So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 is the last page. So, how many numbers? The first is 8, last is 488. The count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49.

Let's count: Each block of 100 contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, that's 9 instead of 10 because 489 is beyond 488. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one block of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=40+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 89.

Wait, 480 to 489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers.

So, total in tens place: 4\u00d710 +9=40+9=49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98 eights.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it.

Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, etc.) and one block of 9. So, 4*10 +9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the difference between fours and eights is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, did I count correctly? Let me double-check the fours in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Yes, that's correct. For the eights in the tens place, I had 4 blocks of 10 and one of 9, totaling 49. That seems right.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 fours. So, total number of fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. Eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. But wait, I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. The hundreds digit is 4 in pages 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in hundreds place. Correct. For the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 5*10=50. Correct. Units place: from 4,14,...484, which is 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct. So, 188 fours. For eights: units place: 8,18,...488, which is 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, 98 eights. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 40-49 is in the first 100 pages, right? So that's correct. So 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th term. Wait, 8 is the 1st, 18 is 2nd, ..., 488 is the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, that's 480-488: 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, for the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 *10=40. Then, 480-488 contributes 9 eights in the tens place. So total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's) =90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with inclusive counts. Let me verify the units place for 4's: from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers. So, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 49 numbers. That seems right. Tens place for 4's: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89. So 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place, 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 5 sets of 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 numbers.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. The last number is 488, so how many 8's in units place? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which gives 48 eights. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th? Let me check: 8,18,...,488. The first is 8 (1), then 18 (2), ..., up to 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be next, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, how many sets do we have? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, did I count correctly in the tens place for eights? Let me check again. The tens place eights: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. For fours, the hundreds place goes up to 488, so 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is correct. Units and tens places seem correct too. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be 91, but maybe I was wrong. Let me check the units place for fours again. Units place fours: 4,14,24,...,484. How many numbers is that? The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) +1. So, (488-4)=484, divided by 10 is 48.4, floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 fours in units place. That's correct. Similarly, for eights in units place: 8,18,...,488. Same calculation: floor((488-8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. So, yes, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of fours is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digit is 8, so that's included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many blocks? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights are units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that's 49+49=98. So, now, number of fours is 188, number of eights is 98. The difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block is 10, and there are 5 blocks, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so 49. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,...,480-488. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49+49=98.

So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check the counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For 4's: Units:49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the tens digit being 8. Let's count how many blocks: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) =4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, 40+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. The difference is 188-98=90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for fours. Let me check again. For fours in the tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's five blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. For eights in the tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's five blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. That's correct. So, the counts seem right. Therefore, the difference is 90. Wait, but wait, let me check if the hundreds place for fours is correct. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, that's correct. So, the total fours are 188, eights are 98, difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so 440-449 is within 488. So, that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each, so 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 all fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in each of these, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, no, 99 + 89 is 188? Wait, 99 + 80 is 179, plus 9 is 188. Yes, that's correct. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is included. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, 8, 18, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except possibly the last block. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4x10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me double-check. 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. Then, in the tens place, 50 fours, and units place 49. So, 89 + 50 +49=188. For eights, units and tens each have 49, so 98 total. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Number of occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block which contributes 9.\n   - Number of occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me see how many there are.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 is included. So, how many blocks? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me double-check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but actually, each number from 400-488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's correct. So, hundreds place has 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours from each place: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total number of 4's is 188.

Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8. Let me see: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, is that correct? No, actually, the tens digit is 8 from 480 to 489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, in the tens place, each full hundred contributes 10 eights, except the last one, which contributes 9. So, how many full hundreds are there?

    "text": " Wait, does 440-449 fit within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but when I think about it, in the hundreds place, numbers from 400-488 have the hundreds digit as 4, but that's a different digit position. So, for the tens place, it's 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many numbers? The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place is 49. Tens place: as above, 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is included. So, how many terms? First term 8, last term 488. Step is 10. So, ((488 -8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. How many tens places have 8? Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: let's see, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in all these, so that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so yes, 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, number of fours is 188, number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me double-check the counting for eights in the tens place. For example, in the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, right? So, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) give 40, plus 9 gives 49. That seems correct. And units place: 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. So, total eights: 49+49=98. Fours: 188. So, 188-98=90. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). \n   - Number of 4's: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Number of 4's: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Number of 4's: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Number of 8's: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges each contribute 10 numbers, and the last range contributes 9 numbers (480-488).\n   - Number of 8's: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8 (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Number of 8's: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 count as 10? Yes, because 440, 441,...,449 are all valid page numbers. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But in each of these, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me double-check. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The last one is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, 8, 18, ..., 488: that's 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 =9). Wait, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, right? So, 4 blocks with 10 eights each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one block with 9 eights (480-488). So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but let me confirm. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me verify the number of fours again. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.
