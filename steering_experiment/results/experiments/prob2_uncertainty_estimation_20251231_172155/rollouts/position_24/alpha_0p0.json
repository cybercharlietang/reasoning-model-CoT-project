    "text": " So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 numbers. So, 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. From 1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10. From 201-300: 240-249 \u2192 10. From 301-400: 340-349 \u2192 10. From 401-488: 440-449 \u2192 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many 8's in the units place? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Let's calculate how many numbers: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Let me count each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights printed are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to miscount. Let me verify the number of 4's again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) +1 = floor(484/10)+1=48+1=49. That seems correct. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89. 49+50+89=188. That seems right. For 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10=48, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10*4 +9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I feel like 90 might be high. Let me think differently. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, but each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. That seems correct. For 8's, the hundreds place is zero because the book only goes up to 488, so no page numbers in the 800s. So, 98 eights in total. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in 800-899, so 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** 90 more 4's are printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-499). Wait, actually, from 0-488, the blocks are 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, in each block except the last one, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. Let's see: - 40-49: 10 numbers - 140-149: 10 numbers - 240-249: 10 numbers - 340-349: 10 numbers - 440-449: 10 numbers But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 count as 10 numbers? Yes, because 440 to 449 is 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place. So, total of 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Wait, let me double-check that. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. That's (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So 89. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many. The last number is 488, which is the 488th page. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let's check: from 1-488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of 8's in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 is included, we have 48 +1=49? Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence. Let me think: 8,18,28,...,488. The first is 8, which is the 8th page, and the last is 488, which is the 488th page. The number of terms in this sequence is ((488 -8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. But wait, the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is within 380-389, but 480-489 would be next, but since it's only up to 488, 480-488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's break it down: - 80-89:10 numbers - 180-189:10 numbers - 280-289:10 numbers - 380-389:10 numbers - 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480 is the first, 488 is the last). So, 480-488:9 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. Wait, let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98 eights. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. Units place: 49 eights, correct. Tens place: 49 eights, correct. Hundreds place: 0. So total eights: 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Total occurrences: 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No numbers in 1-488 have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Wait, but let me confirm: from 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, and 440-449 is 10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5\u00d710=50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours printed are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. Again, I'll check each place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. To find the count: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many numbers in each set. From 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. From 401-488: 480-488. Now, how many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, the first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9. So, total tens place eights: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, yes, 4\u00d710=40 plus 9 is 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights printed are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the tens place for fours again. I had 440-449 as the last set, which is 10 numbers. So, 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, so 5\u00d710=50. That's correct. For eights, in the tens place, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 4\u00d710 +9=49. Correct. So, the difference is indeed 90.

But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So total tens place fours would be 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 50 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, the number of 8's in the units place is 49 (since 488 is included). Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. The last number is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many blocks there are. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. But wait, the book goes up to 488, so after 400, the next block would be 480-489, but the book only goes up to 488. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens place eights would be 40 (from 1-400) plus 9 (from 480-488) = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me think again: from 1-400, each hundred block has 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 blocks give 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so yes, 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

    "text": " How many such blocks are there? From 1-400, there are 4 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 440-449 is in the 400-499 range, and since 488 is less than 499, do we have all 10 numbers in 440-449? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is the 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but including 488, that's 49 occurrences. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 380-389. Let's see: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there? From 1-300, there are 3 blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 380-389 is within 488, so that's valid. So, 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 4 * 10 = 40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 380-389 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 40 + 0 = 89. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 89 = 99. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: Units place: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. Total: 188. For 8's: Units: 49, Tens: 40, Hundreds: 0. Total: 89. Difference: 188 - 89 = 99. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for 4's. Let me check that again. For the tens place of 4's, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. That seems correct. Similarly, for the units place, 49 fours, correct. Hundreds place, 89 fours, correct. For 8's, units place: 49, correct because 488 is included. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each 10 numbers, so 40 eights. Correct. So, total 8's: 89. So, 188 - 89 = 99. Therefore, there are 99 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 4 such blocks.\n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **89**.\n\n**Difference:**\n- More 4's than 8's: 188 - 89 = **99**.\n\n$\\boxed{99}$"

    "text": " From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing an 8. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8*50=400, but 488 is the 49th 8 in the units place. Wait, no, let me think again. From 1-488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is the number of complete tens plus any extra. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, each 10 has one 8, so 48 times, plus the 8 in 488, which is the 49th. Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th number where the units digit is 8? Let me list them: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + 10(n-1). So, 8 +10(n-1) =488. So, 10(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, when counting the tens place for 4's, I considered up to 440-449, which is within 488, so that's correct. For the units place, 4's go up to 484, which is correct. For 8's, in the tens place, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. Units place for 8's: 49, correct because 488 is included. So, 49+49=98 eights. Fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each 100 numbers contribute 10 fours, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 fours.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).

Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours = 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me check: from 1-488, the units digit cycles every 10, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488.

From 201-300: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 301-400: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 401-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so that's 9 instead of 10. So, the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (from 1-400) and then 9 in the last block. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights = 98.

    "text": " So, from 1-100: 40-49, which is 10 numbers. From 101-200: 140-149, another 10. From 201-300: 240-249, another 10. From 301-400: 340-349, another 10. From 401-488: 440-449, another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50 fours. Hmm, wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place has 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets, so 48+1=49 numbers. Wait, no: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's check: 488 is 48*10 + 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So, how many sets do we have? Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see: 1-100: 80-89, 10 numbers. 101-200: 180-189, 10. 201-300: 280-289, 10. 301-400: 380-389, 10. 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place, how many times does 8 appear in the tens digit? 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, no: 1-100: 10, 101-200:10, 201-300:10, 301-400:10, 401-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought the number of 4's was 188 and 8's was 98, so the difference would be 90. But let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems a bit high. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with 4's: Units place: 4,14,...,484. So, from 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. Now for 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. ((488-8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, and the last block has 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me think again. When counting the hundreds place for 4's, I included 400-488, which is 89 numbers. But in the tens place for 4's, I included 440-449, which is within 400-488. So, when counting the hundreds place, I have 400-488, which includes 440-449. So, the 440-449 is already counted in both the hundreds and tens places. Wait, but when counting digits, each digit position is considered separately, so overlapping is allowed. So, for example, 444 has two 4's, one in the hundreds, one in the tens, and one in the units. So, each occurrence is counted separately, so that's correct. So, the total is indeed 188 fours and 98 eights, so the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484. This gives 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens digit in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds digit from 400 to 488, giving 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8 to 488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens digit in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's appear in the hundreds digit as the book ends at 488.\n   \nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " From 1-400, there are four such blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, that's five blocks, but 440-449 is within 488, so it's valid. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which suggests 49 numbers, but let me check. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10: 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me see: 488 is the 49th term because 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10 => 488 - 8 = (n-1)*10 => 480 = (n-1)*10 => n-1 = 48 => n=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. From 1-400, there are four blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each gives 10 eights, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the next block is 480-488. How many numbers here have 8 in the tens place? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. Each of these has 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Wait, no, from 1-400, it's 4 blocks of 100, so 4 sets where the tens digit is 4, each contributing 10 numbers. So that's 4*10=40. But wait, from 440-449, that's within 400-499, but since the book goes up to 488, does 440-449 fully fall within the book? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 sets? Wait, no, 40-49 is the first set, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, and so on up to 440-449. So, that's 5 sets, so 5*10=50.

But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. That's 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, 49+50=99, plus 89=188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The first is 8, the last is 488. The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many terms there are. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. Solving for n: (n-1)*10 = 480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10*4 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units place: 4,14,...,484: 484 is the 49th term because (484 -4)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488: 488 is the 49th term because (488-8)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds place: 0. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

Wait, but from 401-488, 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 89 fours.

Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take 48 full groups, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then 488 itself is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. From 401-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers (since 488 is the end). So, that's 4 blocks with 10 each and one block with 9. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of eights is 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, checking the fours:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484. Since 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4, so 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place is 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each 10 numbers, so 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.

So, 4\u00d710 +9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal eights: 49 +49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, difference is 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer is 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I feel like that's a lot. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right because each of those numbers has a 4 in the hundreds digit. Similarly, for eights, in the hundreds place, there are none because the book ends at 488. So, yes, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, the calculation seems correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers). 101-200: 140-149 (10 numbers). 201-300: 240-249 (10 numbers). 301-400: 340-349 (10 numbers). 401-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, total tens place fours: 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Wait, but wait a second, the hundreds digit is 4 only when the number is between 400 and 499. But since the book ends at 488, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many. The first is 8, the last is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me check: 8\u00d71=8, 8\u00d72=16, but wait, no, the units digit cycles every 10. So, the number of 8's in units place is the number of times 8 appears as the last digit. From 1 to 488, how many multiples of 10 plus 8? So, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me compute how many terms: The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. So, number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is included. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480,481,...,488, which is 9 numbers). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8 in this book. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. There are 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488. Occurrences: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours would be 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours printed are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 occurrences, right? Because 488 is the last one, so 8, 18, ..., 488. That's 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. Let me count how many sets there are. Each 100 numbers have one set of 10 where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-400, that's 4 sets: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10 eights. So, 4*10=40 eights. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 in 9 numbers here. So, total tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9. So, yes, 9 eights in the tens place from 480-488. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights printed are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units: 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct.\n- Tens: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). Wait, that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But earlier I thought from 1-400, it's 4 sets, but actually, 400-499 would be another set, but since the book ends at 488, 440-449 is included, making it 5 sets. Wait, no, from 1-400, the sets are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, which is 4 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then from 400-488, 440-449 is another 10 numbers, so 40+10=50. So that's correct. Then hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nFor eights:\n- Units: 8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct.\n- Tens: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n- Hundreds: 0. So, 49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place (e.g., 80-89). From 1-400, there are 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights are 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. This is 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This is 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear. This is 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

From 401-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's 5 blocks of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but that seems high. Let me think again. The hundreds place is 4 for numbers 400-499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-100: 80-89, 10 numbers. From 101-200: 180-189, 10. From 201-300: 280-289, 10. From 301-400: 380-389, 10. From 401-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me confirm: 4 blocks of 10 (from 1-400) give 40, plus the last block 480-488 gives 9, so total 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Wait, that's 49 in units and 49 in tens, so 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So total tens place fours would be 40 + 10 = 50. Hmm, but wait, 401-488 is actually part of the 400-488 range, which is 89 numbers. But the tens digit being 4 occurs only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 40 from 1-400 and 10 from 401-488, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 1-488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, and then an extra 4 in 484. So that's 49 fours in the units place. Tens place: as calculated, 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, and then an extra 8 in 488. So that's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count these. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, 40 from 1-400 and 9 from 401-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me just cross-verify the counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that adds 10 more.

So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. For eights: units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. When I was counting the tens place for 4's, I considered numbers like 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers, so from 1-400, that's 4 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each with 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then from 400-488, the next block would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct. For the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Units place: from 4, 14, ..., 484. How many? Let's see: 484 is the last page. So, the units digit 4 occurs at 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of such numbers is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct. So, units place fours: 49. Now, for the eights: units place, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me recount. Units place eights: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The last page is 488, which ends with 8, so that's included. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The first term is 8, which is 8 + 10*(n-1) \u2264 488. So, 8 + 10*(n-1) \u2264 488 \u2192 10*(n-1) \u2264 480 \u2192 n-1 \u2264 48 \u2192 n \u2264 49. So, there are 49 eights in the units place. That's correct. For the tens place eights: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. So, fours: 188, eights: 98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Then, 401-500 would have 440-449, but since the book only goes up to 488, we need to check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's another 10. So, total tens place fours: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50. Wait, but from 1-400, that's four sets of 100, each contributing 10 fours, so 40. Then, from 401-488, we have another 10 in 440-449, making it 50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups of 10, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many full sets we have. From 1-100: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. 101-200: 180-189, another 10. 201-300: 280-289, another 10. 301-400: 380-389, another 10. Then, 401-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, we have 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, but let me double-check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me check the tens place for fours again. When counting tens place fours, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so the tens digit can also be 4 in 440-449. So, that's correct. Similarly, for eights in the tens place, up to 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 49 in total. So, yes, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (including 440-449 within 488).\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block which has 9 (480-488).\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. To find how many, I can take 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. So, taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each block. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 eights, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90.

Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 in the 400s, but wait, 401-488: the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 1 for 410-419, up to 8 for 480-488. So, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 only for 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So total tens place fours are 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 1-488, so that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first 4 is at 4, and the last is at 484. The number of terms is floor(488/10) + 1 if 488 mod 10 >=4. 488/10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is greater than or equal to 4, we add 1, so 49 fours in the units place. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 1-400, that's 4 sets, each contributing 10, so 40. From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is another 10. So 40 + 10 = 50. Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89. Total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but since 488 is included, we add 1. So 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each block of 100 contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49 + 49 = 98? Wait, no, 49 + 49 is 98, but let me check again. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49. So, total eights: 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.

Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, adding that, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but let me double-check. From 1-400: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349. That's four sets, each with 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, 440-449 in 401-488 adds another 10, so total 50.

Let's find how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me list them: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, starting from 8, each step is +10. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. Let's solve for when 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. (n-1)*10 \u2264 480, so n-1 \u2264 48, so n \u2264 49. So, there are 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-400, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 4*10=40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, in the hundreds block 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's are 40 (from 1-400) + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with an additional 9 in 480-488. Total = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's as the book doesn't reach 800.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

From 401-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10 fours. So, total in the tens place: 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, so that's fine. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. From 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10 eights. From 101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10 eights. From 201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10 eights. From 301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10 eights. From 401-488: 480-488. Now, how many numbers are there from 480 to 488? That's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit is 8 in all these 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 (from 1-400) and then 9 in 480-488. So, total in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: number of 4's (188) minus number of 8's (98) = 188 - 98 = 90.

Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours would be 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but let me confirm: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours from all places: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check how many such blocks there are. From 1-400, there are four blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, from 401-488, does the tens digit 8 occur? The next block after 380-389 would be 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 has the tens digit 8. That's 9 numbers (480-488). So, tens place eights: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up the eights from all places: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through each digit place again for both fours and eights.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units: 49. Let me recount: from 4,14,...,484. How many? The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1. (488-4)=484, 484/10=48.4, floor is 48, +1=49. Correct.\n- Tens: 50. Each hundred has 10, and from 400-488, another 10. So, 5 sets, 10 each: 50. Correct.\n- Hundreds: 89. From 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nFor eights:\n- Units: 49. From 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10=48, +1=49. Correct.\n- Tens: 49. As above, 10 in each hundred, and 9 in 480-488. Correct.\n- Hundreds: 0. Correct.\nTotal eights: 49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 numbers. That's 4*10 = 40 fours. But wait, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens place fours would be 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but let me think again. From 1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10 fours. 101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10 fours. 201-300: 240-249 \u2192 10 fours. 301-400: 340-349 \u2192 10 fours. 401-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 fours. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place has 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the units digit. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but including 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is the 49th? Let me check: 8,18,...,488. The count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-489 would be the next set, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. Let's count each block: - 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10 eights. - 101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10 eights. - 201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10 eights. - 301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10 eights. - 401-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total eights are units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, the difference between fours and eights is 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89 \u2192 total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49 \u2192 total 98. 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the tens place for fours. Let me check again. For fours in the tens place, from 1-400, there are four blocks of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 40 +10=50. That seems correct. For eights in the tens place: from 1-400, four blocks, each with 10 eights, so 40. Then, from 401-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 40 +9=49. Units place for both fours and eights is 49 each, so that's correct. Hundreds place for fours is 89, and none for eights. So, total fours 188, eights 98, difference 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, 40 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89; 89 + 89 = 178. So, there are 178 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, first, let's count the complete blocks: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights: 4*10=40. Now, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 178 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 80. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought the hundreds place for fours was 89, but when I added, 49+40+89=178. Let me double-check the counts again. For fours: units 49, tens 40, hundreds 89. Total 178. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. So, 178 - 98 = 80. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the fours in the hundreds place: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place: from 4 to 484, that's 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours: 5*10=50. Wait, earlier I thought it was 40. Oh no, I think I made a mistake here. Let me correct that. So, when counting fours in the tens place, from 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. So, earlier I thought it was 40, but it's actually 50. So, total fours would be units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, that's different. So, I think I made a mistake earlier in the tens place count. Let me clarify: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's every block where the tens digit is 4, which occurs in the decades 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. So, earlier I thought it was 40, but it's actually 50. So, correcting that, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, for eights: units place is 49, tens place is 49, hundreds place is 0. So, total eights: 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but now I'm getting a different answer. Let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this differently, by considering each digit position separately and calculating how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nLet me try a more systematic approach.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first occurrence is at 4, then 14, 24, ..., up to 484. The number of such numbers is the number of times 4 appears in the units place. The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges in total. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 +1=89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 +89=188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. The last number is 488, so the number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-489. However, since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) each contribute 10 eights, and the last one contributes 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no such numbers. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal eights:49 +49 +0=98.\n\n**Difference:** Number of fours - number of eights=188 -98=90.\n\nWait, so the difference is 90 fours more than eights. But earlier I thought it was 80. So, where did I go wrong earlier? I think the mistake was in counting the tens place for fours. Initially, I thought it was 40, but it's actually 50. So, the correct total is 188 fours and 98 eights, leading to a difference of 90.\n\nBut let me double-check the tens place for fours. From 40-49:10 numbers, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 fours, so 50. Yes, that's correct. So, the total fours are indeed 188.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the tens place: 80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit from the right):** The digit '4' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit from the right):** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit from the right):** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n   **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '8' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '8' does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n   **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' appears 90 times more than the digit '8' in the page numbers.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 numbers. So that's 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, is that right? Let me check: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Yeah, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me add that again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Okay, so 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-400, there are four blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). In each block, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, each block contributes 10 numbers, so 4 blocks * 10 = 40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 numbers instead of 10. So, total tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, is that correct? Let me list them: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place eights: 0. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

From 401-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, total tens place fours: 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is only 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of fours is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each block: - 80-89: 10 eights. - 180-189: 10 eights. - 280-289: 10 eights. - 380-389: 10 eights. - 480-488: how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, each of these blocks contributes 10 eights except the last one, which contributes 9. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. Wait, no, actually, the first four blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10 eights, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, the last block is 480-488, which has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of eights is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Similarly, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 is another 10, 340-349 is another 10, and 440-449 is another 10. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So that's 5*10=50.

So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds digits with 8.

Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50. But wait, does 400-409 also have 4 in the tens place? Yes, 400-409 is part of the 401-488 range, right? Wait no, 400-409 would be in the 400-499 range, but our book goes only up to 488. So, 400-409 is included. So, actually, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409 and 440-449. That's two sets of 10, so 20 fours. So, adding to the previous 40 (from 1-400), total is 40 + 20 = 60 fours in the tens place. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. From 1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10 fours. 101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10 fours. 201-300: 240-249 \u2192 10 fours. 301-400: 340-349 \u2192 10 fours. So that's 4*10=40 fours. Now, from 401-488: 400-409: but wait, 400 is the start of the next hundred. Wait, 401-488 includes 400-488, but 400 is page 400, which is included. So, 400-409 is 10 numbers, and 440-449 is another 10. So that's 20 fours. So total tens place fours: 40 + 20 = 60. Hmm, that seems correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (60) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 60 = 109, 109 + 89 = 198. So, total fours: 198. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, it's included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. From 1-400: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4*10=40 eights. Now, from 401-488: 480-488. The tens digit is 8 here, but how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 198 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 100. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: Units place: 49. Tens place: 60. Hundreds place: 89. Total: 198. For eights: Units place: 49. Tens place: 49. Hundreds place: 0. Total: 98. Difference: 198 - 98 = 100. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 100 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. This totals 60 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This is 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 60 + 89 = 198.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. This totals 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as there are no pages beyond 488. This is 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n198 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 100.\n\n$\\boxed{100}$"

    "text": " So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. That's 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours would be 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: Each hundred block has 10, so 4 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) give 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40+10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many. The last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th term because (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers. Let's see how many such blocks are there. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399). Each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me check again because I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. Let me recount the tens place for 8's. From 1-400, each hundred block has 10 numbers with tens digit 8, so 4 blocks give 40. From 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 40+9=49. That's correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Fours are 188. So, 188 -98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences (including 480-488).\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, from 1-400, how many such blocks are there? There are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's another 10 numbers, so 40 + 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's 10 more. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. Let me calculate: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188 fours in total. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Let's count the number of 8's in each place. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is 488, so how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4 x 10 = 40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.

Let's see how many times that is. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so how many numbers? Let's count each block. Each block from 0-99, 100-199, etc., has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, how many such blocks are there? From 1-400, there are four blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is included, 480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place.

    "text": " So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, no, actually, from 0-99, the tens digit 4 is in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 100-199: 140-149, another 10. 200-299: 240-249, 10. 300-399: 340-349, 10. 400-488: 440-449, 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's printed is 188. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last occurrence is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one. So, 8, 18, ..., 488. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check up to 488. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 0-99: 80-89, 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189, 10. 200-299: 280-289, 10. 300-399: 380-389, 10. 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book stops at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place for 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times, not 10. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks (0-399) each with 10, so 4*10=40, plus 9 from 400-488, totaling 49. Wait, but let me check: 0-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that can't be right. Let me recount. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. So total eights: 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's was 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake. Let me verify the units place for 4's: from 4,14,...484. How many? The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) +1 = floor(484/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. For tens place for 4's: in each hundred, 10 numbers, and from 400-488, another 10 (440-449). So, 5 hundreds blocks (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place: 8,18,...488. How many? (488 -8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last block contributes 9, so 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none. So, 49+49=98. Therefore, the difference is 188-98=90.

    "text": " How many such blocks are there? From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. That's 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is part of the 401-500 range, but our book stops at 488, so does 440-449 fit entirely within 401-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 eights. That's 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, yes, 9 eights in the tens place for 480-488. So, total eights in tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct. I think I did this right.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.
