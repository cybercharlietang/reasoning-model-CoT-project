    "text": " So, from 1-100: 40-49, that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 101-200: 140-149, another 10. 201-300: 240-249, another 10. 301-400: 340-349, another 10. Then, 401-488: Here, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 401-488 is only 88 numbers, but the tens digit in 440-449 is still 10 numbers. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The number of complete groups of 10 is 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8), so 48 times, but wait, the last group is 480-488, so 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, yes, 49 fours in the units place. Tens place: Each 100 numbers have 10 fours in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 sets of 100, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10. So total 50 fours in the tens place. Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many? The last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th multiple of 10 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 49 numbers). So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Similar to fours, but let's check. Each 100 numbers have a block where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 1-400: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's 4 sets of 10, so 40 eights. Then, 480-488: that's 9 eights in the tens place (since 480-488 is 9 numbers). So total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences.

    "text": " There are 5 such blocks up to 400: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-500. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 401-488. Let me see: Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so that's 4*10=40 fours. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So total tens place fours would be 4*10 + 10 = 50. Wait, no, let me check again. The first block is 1-100: 40-49, that's 10 fours. Second block 101-200: 140-149, 10 fours. Third block 201-300: 240-249, 10 fours. Fourth block 301-400: 340-349, 10 fours. Fifth block 401-500: 440-449, 10 fours. But since the book ends at 488, the fifth block is only up to 488, but 440-449 is within that, so that's 10 fours. So total tens place fours are 5*10=50. Wait, but 401-488 includes 440-449, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units place 49 + tens place 50 + hundreds place 89 = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the 8's, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, does 488 count? Yes, because the last page is 488. So, how many such numbers are there? The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but we have to include 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, the last block is 401-488. In this block, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units place 49 + tens place 49 + hundreds place 0 = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Wait, let me check again. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. So total eights are 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, from 1-100: 10 numbers (40-49). From 101-200: another 10 (140-149). Similarly, 201-300: 10 (240-249). 301-400: 10 (340-349). Then, from 401-500: but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 401-488. So, how many tens digits of 4 are there in 401-488? From 400-499, each hundred has 10 such numbers, but since we're stopping at 488, the last block is 401-488. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449. That's 10 numbers again, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers. Wait, but 400-499 would have 100 numbers, but we're only going up to 488, so does that affect the count? Actually, in the tens place, the number of times 4 appears is determined by how many complete hundreds we have and any partial hundreds. Let me think differently. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each 100 numbers, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10 = 40 fours. But wait, in the last hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 only from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 fours, so total tens fours would be 4*10 = 40? Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, 4*10=40 fours in the tens place. But wait, 401-488 is the fifth hundred, but it's only 88 numbers. However, the tens digit being 4 in 401-488 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10 fours. So, total tens fours would be 5*10=50? Wait, no, because 488 is less than 500, so the fifth hundred isn't complete. But the tens digit being 4 in the fifth hundred (401-500) occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, that's still 10 numbers. So, total tens fours would be 5*10=50? Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so does that affect the count? Let me think again. Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has exactly 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). In each of the 4 complete hundreds, there are 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. In the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens fours would be 40+10=50. So, units place: 49 fours, tens place: 50 fours. Now, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: every 10 numbers, so 488/10=48.8, so 49 fours. Tens place: every 100 numbers, 10 fours per hundred, so 4 hundreds give 40, plus in the fifth hundred (401-488), 10 fours, so 50 total. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 1-100: 10 numbers (80-89). 101-200: 10 (180-189). 201-300: 10 (280-289). 301-400: 10 (380-389). 401-488: in the tens place, 8 occurs in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480-488. Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480 is the first, then 481, ..., 488. Wait, 480 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (since 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9). So, in the tens place, for each complete hundred, we have 10 eights, and in the incomplete hundred, we have 9 eights. So, total tens eights: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 1-100: 10 eights. 101-200:10. 201-300:10. 301-400:10. 401-488: in the tens place, 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens eights: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the hundreds place has 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, this occurs 49 times (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), each contributing 10 occurrences except the last block, which contributes 10 (440-449). Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '8' appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 complete hundreds contributing 40 occurrences, and in the last block (401-488), it appears 9 times (480-488). Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '8' does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " There are 488 pages, so how many complete hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each. So, 4 times 10 is 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-499. But our book only goes up to 488, so from 400-488, each number has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours printed are 188. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens and then 8 in 488. Wait, actually, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one more. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 eights. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, tens place contributes 40 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, but 480-489 is the full set, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, yes, 9. So, total in tens place: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights printed are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

    "text": " So, from 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 201-300: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 301-400: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 401-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, it's from 400-488. Each hundred block has 100 numbers, but here it's only up to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, every number from 400 to 488 has 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 numbers. Wait, no. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, the count is 89 numbers. But wait, 400 is included, so from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488. So, that's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 201-300: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 301-400: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 401-488: 480-488. Now, how many numbers is that? From 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the hundreds place 4, the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times instead of 10. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 1-400) and then 9 in 480-488. So, 4*10 +9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 1-100:10, 101-200:10, 201-300:10, 301-400:10, 401-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in each block of 100 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last set being 480-488 (9 occurrences). Total is 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? From 1-100: 10 fours in the tens place (40-49). From 101-200: another 10 (140-149). From 201-300: another 10 (240-249). From 301-400: another 10 (340-349). From 401-488: another 10 (440-449). Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-499. But our book only goes up to 488, so it's 400-488. How many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when we're counting the hundreds digit, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high. Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but let's check: 8, 18, ..., 488. The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-100: 80-89, that's 10 eights. From 101-200: 180-189, another 10. From 201-300: 280-289, another 10. From 301-400: 380-389, another 10. From 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for the last block. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems right. Wait, but let me check the tens place for fours again. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, and there are 5 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488). Wait, but 401-488 is only part of the 500s, but up to 488. So, in 401-488, how many tens digits of 4 are there? From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's correct. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. Similarly, for eights in the tens place, we had 4 full blocks (1-400) each contributing 10, and the last block (401-488) contributing 9, so 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: both fours and eights have 49 occurrences, which makes sense because 488 is the last page, so the units digit cycles every 10, and 488 is the 49th occurrence for both. So, I think my counts are correct. Therefore, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98, so the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of 4's: 49 (since 484 is the 49th occurrence).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - Up to 488, there are 5 such blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488).\n   - Number of 4's: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Numbers 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Number of 4's: 89 (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n- Units: 49 + Tens: 50 + Hundreds: 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of 8's: 49 (since 488 is the 49th occurrence).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n   - Up to 488, there are 4 full blocks (1-400), each contributing 10, and the last block (401-488) contributes 9 (480-488).\n   - Number of 8's: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (as the book ends at 488).\n   - Number of 8's: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n- Units: 49 + Tens: 49 + Hundreds: 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's (188) - Number of 8's (98) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " There are four such blocks in 488 pages: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-500. But wait, 401-500 would go up to 488, so the last block isn't complete. Let me see: Each complete block (like 1-100) contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, from 1-400, there are four blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so that's 4*10=40 fours. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's another 10 fours. Wait, but 488 is beyond 449, but the tens digit from 440-449 is 4, so that's 10 more. So, total tens place fours would be 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but let me confirm: 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers), 101-200: 140-149 (10), 201-300: 240-249 (10), 301-400: 340-349 (10), and 401-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, earlier I thought 401-488 is the fifth block, but actually, 401-500 would be the fifth, but since we only go up to 488, does that affect the count? No, because 440-449 is within 401-488, so it's still 10 numbers. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, let me check: 400 is the first, 401, 402, ..., up to 488. So, yes, 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check each part. Units place: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block has 10, so 5 blocks, 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each complete block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 1-400, there are four blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 eights in the tens place here. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. Did I count correctly? For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. Difference is 90. Hmm, but let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. And for the tens place, 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Units place, 49 fours. So, yes, 188 fours. For eights, units place: 49, tens place: 49, so 98. So, the difference is indeed 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in every set of 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). \n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100 numbers:\n   - Each block (e.g., 40-49, 140-149) contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - There are 5 such blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488), but only the first four are complete.

Now, from 401-488: the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 in each hundred, but here, the hundred is 400-499, but our book ends at 488. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 in the hundreds place. So, that's 10 numbers: 400-409, 410-419, ..., 440-449. Wait, no, actually, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, let me check: From 1-400, each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 hundreds would be 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449. Wait, but 400-409 is part of the 1-400 range, right? Because 400 is included in the first 400 pages. So, maybe I should adjust. Let me think differently. From 1-400, the number of fours in the tens place is 4 sets of 10, which is 40. Then, from 401-488, how many more fours in the tens place? The tens digit is 4 in 400-409, but 400 is already counted in the first 400. So, in 401-488, the next occurrence is 410-419, which is another 10. Then 420-429, another 10. Then 430-439, another 10. Then 440-449, another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, but 400-409 is already included in the first 400, so from 401-488, it's 4 sets of 10, which is 40. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me use a formula. The number of times a digit appears in the tens place up to N can be calculated as follows: For each hundred block, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, up to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 (since 4*100=400). Each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4*10=40. Now, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), how many fours in the tens place? The tens digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, but 400 is included in the first 400. So, in 401-488, the next set would be 410-419, which is 10 numbers, then 420-429, another 10, 430-439, another 10, and 440-449, another 10. So that's 4 more sets of 10, which is 40. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 4 sets beyond the initial 400. So, total fours in tens place would be 40 (from 1-400) plus 40 (from 401-488), totaling 80. But wait, that can't be right because 400-488 is only 89 numbers, and in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so 4 hundreds would give 40, but from 401-488, it's part of the 400-499 range, so maybe I'm double-counting. I think I need a better approach. Let me consider each position separately.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to calculate the number of fours in each position separately and then sum them up.\n\nSo, for the units place:\n\nIn each block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0-9, so each digit appears once. So, in 1-488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1 four in the units place, so 48 fours. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1-8, so no additional fours. So total units fours: 48.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 49. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again. From 1-480, that's 48 blocks of 10, each contributing 1 four in the units place, so 48 fours. Then, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so no fours. So total units fours: 48.\n\nNow, tens place:\n\nIn each block of 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each block of 100, there are 10 fours in the tens place. How many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). So, 4*10=40 fours in the tens place from these. Now, in the remaining block (401-488), how many fours in the tens place? The tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449. Wait, but 400-409 is part of 401-488, but 400 is included in the previous block (301-400). Wait, no, 401-488 is the next block after 400. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, but 400 is not included in 401-488. So, the first occurrence in 401-488 would be 410-419, which is 10 numbers, then 420-429, another 10, 430-439, another 10, and 440-449, another 10. So that's 4 sets of 10, which is 40 fours. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 40 fours. So, total tens fours: 40 (from 1-400) + 40 (from 401-488) = 80? But that seems high because 488 is less than 500. Wait, maybe I'm overcounting. Let me think differently. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Each block is 10 numbers, and each block occurs every 100 numbers. So, in 1-400, there are 4 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the next block would be 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So, total tens fours: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, from 1-400, 40 fours in the tens place, and from 401-488, 10 fours (440-449). So, total tens fours: 50.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nThe hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, but let me check again because I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place. Let me recount the tens place.\n\nFrom 1-400, each hundred block contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 blocks * 10 = 40.\n\nFrom 401-488, the next occurrence of the tens digit being 4 is in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, that's 10 more. So, total tens fours: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSo, units: 48, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. Total fours: 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nAgain, we'll check units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1 eight. So, 48 eights in the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit is 8 in 488, so that's 1 more. So, total units eights: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many sets of 10 there are.\n\nFrom 1-400, each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 blocks * 10 = 40.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 in all these 9 numbers. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, total tens eights: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. From 1-400, each hundred block has 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total fours: 187, total eights: 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, earlier I thought units fours were 48, but when I first considered units place, I thought it was 49. Let me check again.\n\nUnits place for fours: from 1-488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place?\n\nThey are 4,14,24,...,484. So, 484 is the last one. To find how many terms, we can do (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units fours: 49.\n\nEarlier, I thought it was 48, but now I see it's 49. So, I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nSo, units fours: 49.\n\nTens fours: as before, 50.\n\nHundreds fours: 89.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nSimilarly, for eights:\n\nUnits eights: 49 (as before).\n\nTens eights: 49.\n\nHundreds eights: 0.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so earlier I had 187 fours, but now it's 188. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me recount the units fours. From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units fours: 49.\n\nTens fours: as before, 50.\n\nHundreds fours: 89.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nEights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so I think the correct answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place, fours: 50.\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nTotal fours: 188.\n\nEights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit '4' appears in blocks of 10 numbers within each hundred (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). Up to 488, there are 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n   **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of '8's:**\n   - **Units place:** The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit '8' appears in blocks of 10 numbers within each hundred (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). Up to 488, there are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is '8' since the book ends at 488.\n\n   **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - **Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** 90 more '4's are printed than '8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

From 401-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. Wait, but 400-499 would have 10 numbers each, but our book stops at 488, so the last set is 440-449, which is still 10 numbers. So, how many hundreds are there? From 1-400, that's four blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. Then from 401-488, it's another 10 numbers (440-449). So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 401-488 is only up to 488, so does 440-449 fall within that? Yes, because 440-449 is within 401-488. So, 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 1-488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours, plus the 484 which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 fours. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, so from 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40 fours. Then from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50. Hundreds place: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, plus the 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book stops at 488, so 480-488 is part of the last set. Let's count how many sets: from 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. From 401-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488). So, the first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no hundreds digits with 8. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (from 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (from 8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), with the last block ending at 488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. But wait, the last block is 400-499, but our book ends at 488. So, the 400-488 range still includes the tens digit 4 for 400-409, 410-419, etc., up to 480-489, but since we stop at 488, the tens digit 4 in 480-489 would only be up to 488. So, let me think again. Each hundred block from 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-500. But since the book ends at 488, the last hundred block is 401-488. So, in the tens place, each hundred block has 10 fours. So, from 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. But wait, the last block is 401-488, so does that affect the count? Let me see: In 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, but 400 is already included in the previous blocks. Wait, no, 400 is part of the 401-500 block? No, 400 is actually part of the 400-499 block. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate how many full hundreds are there and then the partial one. From 1-400, there are 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, but 400 is already counted in the previous 400 block. Wait, no, 401-488 is from 401 to 488, so the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, but 400 is part of 400-499, which is beyond 488. Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe a better approach is to consider each hundred block separately. Let's list the hundreds:\n\n- 1-100: tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, which is 10 numbers.\n- 101-200: same, 140-149, 10 numbers.\n- 201-300: 240-249, 10 numbers.\n- 301-400: 340-349, 10 numbers.\n- 401-488: 400-409 is part of 400-499, but our book ends at 488. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, but 400 is actually part of the 400-499 block, which starts at 400. Wait, but 401-488 is from 401 to 488, so the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, but 400 is included in the 400-499 block, which starts at 400. However, since our book goes up to 488, the tens digit 4 in the 400-488 range is from 400-409, which is 10 numbers, and then from 440-449, which is another 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, right? Wait, no, 440-449 is within 400-499, but since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is entirely included. So, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit 4 occurs in two sets: 400-409 (10 numbers) and 440-449 (10 numbers). So, that's 20 fours in the tens place for the 400-488 block. But wait, the 400-488 block is from 401-488, so 400 is included? Wait, the first page is 1, so 400 is included as page 400. So, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409 (10 numbers) and 440-449 (10 numbers), totaling 20 fours. So, adding up all the hundreds:\n\n- 1-100: 10\n- 101-200: 10\n- 201-300: 10\n- 301-400: 10\n- 401-488: 20\n\nWait, but that would be 10+10+10+10+20=60 fours in the tens place. But that seems high. Wait, no, because in the 400-488 block, we're only counting the tens digit 4, which occurs in 400-409 and 440-449, which are 10 and 10 numbers respectively, so 20. So, total tens digit 4's would be 4*10 (from 1-400) + 20 (from 401-488) = 60? Wait, but 4*10 is 40, plus 20 is 60. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct because the 400-488 block is only part of the 400-499 block. Let me check with another approach. Alternatively, the number of times the tens digit is 4 is calculated by how many hundreds blocks we have. Each hundred block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. From 1-400, there are 4 hundred blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, from 401-488, which is 88 numbers, how many times does the tens digit 4 occur? In 400-409, which is 10 numbers, and 440-449, another 10, so 20. So total is 40+20=60. So, 60 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 (units) + 60 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 198.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, units place: 49 fours.\n\nTens place: 60 fours.\n\nHundreds place: 89 fours.\n\nTotal: 49+60=109, 109+89=198.\n\nHmm, 198 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nAgain, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\n- In each hundred block, the tens digit 8 occurs in 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n\nFrom 1-400, there are 4 hundred blocks, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since we stop at 488, that's 9 numbers: 480-488 (tens digit 8). Wait, no, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers (480-488). So, in the tens place, from 401-488, we have 9 eights.\n\nSo, total tens digit 8's: 4*10=40 (from 1-400) +9=49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 80-89: 10 numbers.\n\n180-189: 10.\n\n280-289:10.\n\n380-389:10.\n\n480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page).\n\nSo, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nSo, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nWait, so 98 eights in total.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 198 (fours) -98 (eights)=100.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, for fours:\n\n- Units place: 49.\n\n- Tens place: 60.\n\n- Hundreds place:89.\n\nTotal:49+60=109+89=198.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units place:49.\n\n- Tens place:49.\n\n- Hundreds place:0.\n\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:198-98=100.\n\nHmm, so the answer would be 100 more fours than eights.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for fours. I had 60 fours in the tens place, which came from 4*10=40 (from 1-400) plus 20 from 401-488. But wait, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409 (10 numbers) and 440-449 (10 numbers), so 20. So, 40+20=60. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the tens place, from 1-400, 4*10=40, and from 401-488, 9 eights in the tens place (480-488). So, 40+9=49.\n\nUnits place for both fours and eights is 49 each, which makes sense because in each set of 10 numbers, the digit appears once in the units place, and from 1-488, there are 48 full sets of 10 (480 numbers) plus 8 more (481-488), so 48+1=49 for each digit.\n\nWait, but for fours, in the units place, the last occurrence is 484, which is the 49th four. For eights, the last occurrence in the units place is 488, which is the 49th eight. So that's correct.\n\nSo, the total fours are 198, eights are 98, difference is 100.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit surprised it's 100. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position.\n\nFor a digit d in a given position (units, tens, hundreds), the count can be calculated as:\n\n- For units place: floor(n/10) + 1 if the units digit is >=d, else floor(n/10).\n\nWait, maybe it's better to use a more systematic approach.\n\nLet me try to calculate the number of fours and eights in each digit position.\n\nStarting with fours:\n\n1. **Units place:**\n\nNumber of fours = number of complete groups of 10, plus any extra if the last partial group has a four.\n\nNumber of complete groups: 488 // 10 =48.\n\nEach group contributes 1 four in the units place.\n\nBut wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing 1 four, so 48 fours. But wait, the last group is 481-490, but our book ends at 488, so in the last group, 481-488, the units digit 4 occurs at 484. So, that's one more four. So total units fours:48 +1=49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n\nNumber of fours in the tens place.\n\nEach hundred has 10 fours in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n\nNumber of hundreds:488 // 100=4 (since 4*100=400).\n\nEach of these 4 hundreds contributes 10 fours in the tens place:4*10=40.\n\nNow, check the remaining part:488 -400=88.\n\nIn the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), how many fours in the tens place?\n\nLooking at 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409 and 440-449.\n\nBut since we're starting at 401, 400 is included as page 400, so 400-409 is 10 numbers, but 400 is included in the previous count. Wait, no, 400 is part of the 400-499 block, which we've already partially included up to 488.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think that in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 400-409 and 440-449. So, 400-409 is 10 numbers, but since we start at 401, 400 is included as page 400, so 401-409 is 9 numbers, but wait, 400 is page 400, so 400-409 is 10 numbers, but since our range is 401-488, 400 is included as page 400, so 400-409 is 10 numbers, but 401-409 is 9 numbers. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to calculate how many times the tens digit is 4 in 401-488.\n\nThe tens digit is 4 in 400-409 and 440-449.\n\nBut since our range is 401-488, the 400-409 range includes 400, which is page 400, so 400 is included. So, 400-409 is 10 numbers, but 401-409 is 9 numbers, but 400 is included as page 400, so in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409 (10 numbers) and 440-449 (10 numbers). However, since 400 is included in the 400-409 range, which is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers, and 440-449 is another 10 numbers. So, total 20 fours in the tens place in 401-488.\n\nTherefore, total tens fours:4*10=40 (from 1-400) +20=60.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n\nNumber of fours in the hundreds place is the number of complete hundreds where the hundreds digit is 4.\n\nFrom 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. So, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89 numbers.\n\nSo, hundreds fours:89.\n\nTotal fours:49 (units) +60 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=198.\n\nNow, for eights:\n\n1. **Units place:**\n\nSame as fours, number of eights in units place.\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10:488//10=48.\n\nEach group contributes 1 eight, so 48.\n\nBut check if the last partial group (481-488) has an eight in the units place. 488 is included, so that's one more. So total units eights:48+1=49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n\nNumber of eights in the tens place.\n\nEach hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nNumber of complete hundreds:488//100=4.\n\nEach contributes 10 eights, so 4*10=40.\n\nNow, check the remaining 88 numbers (401-488).\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488.\n\nHow many numbers is that? 488-480+1=9 numbers (480,481,...,488).\n\nSo, in the tens place, 9 eights.\n\nTherefore, total tens eights:40+9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n\nNumber of eights in the hundreds place is zero because the book ends at 488, which is less than 800.\n\nSo, total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nDifference:198 fours -98 eights=100.\n\nSo, the answer is 100 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 198, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 100.\n\n\\boxed{100}"

    "text": " So, for each hundred, that's 10 fours in the tens place. How many hundreds do we have? From 1-100: 10 fours. 101-200: another 10. 201-300: another 10. 301-400: another 10. 401-488: Here, the tens digit is 4 from 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, and then 450-459, etc., but wait, up to 488. Wait, actually, in 401-488, how many blocks of 10 have the tens digit as 4? From 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 400-409 is actually part of the 400-499 range, but since our book ends at 488, the last block would be 480-489, but 488 is the end. Wait, no, the tens digit being 4 is from 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, in 1-488, the number of times the tens digit is 4 is as follows: Each hundred block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 1-100: 10, 101-200:10, 201-300:10, 301-400:10. Then, 401-488: how many? The tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 400-409 is part of the 400-488 range. So total tens place fours would be 4*10 (from the first four hundreds) plus 5*10 from the 400-488 range. Wait, but 400-488 is part of the 400-499 range, so the first four hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40 fours in the tens place. Then, from 400-488, how many tens places with 4? It's 5 blocks (400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449), each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. So total tens place fours would be 40 +50=90? Wait, but that can't be right because 400-488 is only 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). Wait, perhaps I'm overcounting. Let me think again. The tens digit is 4 in the range 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. So that's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so does the 440-449 block exist? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours in the tens place. So, units place:49, tens place:50, and hundreds place: let's see. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, the units digit is 8 every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so the units digit is 8 in 488. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers contribute one 8 in the units place. So, total number of 8's in units place is (488//10)=48.8, but since we're counting whole numbers, it's 48 full tens, but wait, 488 is the last number, so 488 is included. So, how many? From 0-488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full cycles, but since 488 is the 49th number in the units place, so units digit 8 occurs 49 times. Wait, let me check: 8,18,...,488. So, the first is 8 (1st), then 18 (2nd), ..., 488 is the 49th. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 1-100: 10 numbers (80-89), 101-200:10 (180-189), 201-300:10 (280-289), 301-400:10 (380-389), and 401-488: the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Now, how many numbers is that? From 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), but wait, the tens digit is 8 in all these, so that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 (from 1-400) +9=40+9=49. Wait, but wait, let me check: 1-100:10, 101-200:10, 201-300:10, 301-400:10, and 401-488: the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total is 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place eights:0. So total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers (from 4 to 484).\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449). There are 50 occurrences (5 blocks of 10 numbers each).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488). There are 49 occurrences (4 full blocks of 10 and 9 additional numbers in 480-488).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Well, 401-488 includes the 400-499 block, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. Each of these numbers has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, which suggests 49 numbers because 488 is included. Wait, let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except possibly the last one. Let's see: - 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10 eights. - 101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10 eights. - 201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10 eights. - 301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10 eights. - 401-488: 480-488. Here, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for this block. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9 \u2192 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, I'll do the same process for the digit 8. Let's count the number of 8's in each place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the 49th set (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 49 numbers). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488). So, adding these up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89: 10 numbers. Then, 180-189: another 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. And 480-488: that's 9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. Hmm, but wait, in the hundreds place, is there any 8? No, because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is only 1,2,3,4. So, yes, zero. So, total eights are 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my counting again. For fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 188. That seems correct. For eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** Each hundred block contributes 10 occurrences (e.g., 40-49).

    "text": " So, from 1-100: 40-49, that's 10 numbers. From 101-200: 140-149, another 10. From 201-300: 240-249, another 10. From 301-400: 340-349, another 10. From 401-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers as well. Wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's another 10. So, total tens place fours: 10 (from 1-100) + 10 (101-200) + 10 (201-300) + 10 (301-400) + 10 (401-488) = 50 fours. Wait, but 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, total number of fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Wait, let me check that addition again: 49 + 50 = 99, and 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me see: 488 is 8 in the units place, so yes, 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but the hundreds digit is 4. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-100: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. From 101-200: 180-189, another 10. From 201-300: 280-289, another 10. From 301-400: 380-389, another 10. From 401-488: 480-488. Now, in 480-488, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no: 480 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, from 480 to 488, inclusive, that's 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times, not 10. So, total tens place eights: 10 (from 1-100) + 10 (101-200) + 10 (201-300) + 10 (301-400) + 9 (401-488) = 49 eights. Wait, let me check: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, total number of eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Wait, but let me double-check that. Units: 49, Tens: 49, so total 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for fours:\n\n- Units place: 49 fours. Let me recount: from 4, 14, 24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 50 fours. From 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 fours. From 400-488, inclusive. 488-400+1=89. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nNow, for eights:\n\n- Units place: 49 eights. From 8,18,...,488. Let's see: 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 49 eights. From 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0 eights. Correct.\n\nTotal eights: 49+49=98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for fours would be 89, but let me check: from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. Yes, because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place in eights, I had 49, which seems correct because in the last block (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so adding up to 49.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in every block of 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Number of 4's: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block of 100 contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total: 5 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488) \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Number of 4's: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in every block of 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Number of 8's: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block of 100 contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (401-488), which contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " There are four such blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-500. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block (401-500) only goes up to 488. So, in each complete block (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), there are 10 numbers each with 4 in the tens place. That's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the 401-488 block, how many numbers have 4 in the tens place? From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. Each number from 400-488 has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 49 numbers because 488 is included. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count: - From 1-400: Each block of 100 has 10 numbers with tens digit 8. There are four such blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. - From 401-488: The tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

    "text": " So, from 1-100, that's 10 numbers. From 101-200, another 10, and so on. How many hundreds do we have? Let's see, 488 is the last page, so the hundreds go up to 400-488. So, the blocks are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488. Wait, but 401-488 is only part of a block. So, the number of complete hundreds is 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these has 10 numbers with tens digit 4. So, that's 4*10=40. Now, the last block is 401-488. How many numbers here have the tens digit as 4? That's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, adding that, 40 + 10 = 50. So, the tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, each number has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, I need to count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Let me go through each digit position again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? The formula is (488 - 8)/10 + 1. Let's compute that: (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-100, that's 10 numbers. From 101-200, another 10, and so on. How many complete hundreds do we have? Up to 400-488, so 4 complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, the last block is 401-488. Here, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480 is the first number, so from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers, but actually, it's 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. Wait, no: 480 is the first, 481 is the second, up to 488, which is the 9th number. So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, adding that to the previous 40, we get 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

From 401-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, total tens place fours: 5 sets of 10, so 5\u00d710=50. Hmm, but wait, from 1-400, it's four sets of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4\u00d710=40. Then from 401-488, it's another 10 fours in the tens place (440-449). So total is 40+10=50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400-488. Each number in this range has 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, hundreds place has 89 fours. Now, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me check that again. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many terms? The sequence is 8,18,...,488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. Let me set 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, (n-1)*10 = 480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets. Each block of 100 numbers has a set of 10 where the tens digit is 8. From 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. From 401-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 1-400) and 9 from 401-488. So, 4\u00d710=40 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Therefore, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds = 49 +49 +0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10.\n   - The number of terms is calculated by dividing 484 by 10, which gives 48.4. Taking the integer part gives 48, but since 484 is included, we add 1, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.\n   - The count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Similar to the 4's in the units place, this sequence has 49 terms.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 occurrences.\n   - The last block (480-488) contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = **49** occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 201-300: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 301-400: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 401-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets of 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 400-499 count? Since the book ends at 488, the 400-488 range includes 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, the tens place in 400-488: 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. The tens digit is 4 in 400-409, which is 10 numbers, and then again in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 10 + 10 = 20 fours in the tens place for the 400-488 range. But wait, from 1-400, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let me recast this. Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) has 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 fours. Then, from 401-488, how many fours in the tens place? The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total fours in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50. Hmm, but wait, 400-488 includes 400-409 as well, which is another 10 fours in the tens place. So, that would be 40 (from 1-400) + 20 (from 401-488) = 60 fours in the tens place? Wait, no, that can't be right because from 1-400, each hundred block contributes 10 fours, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409 (but 401-409 is part of 401-488, so that's 9 numbers, right? Wait, no, 400-409 is 10 numbers, but 401-409 is 9 numbers. Wait, but 400 is included in the 400-488 range, so from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409 (10 numbers) and 440-449 (another 10 numbers). So, that's 20 fours in the tens place from 400-488. So, total fours in the tens place would be 40 (from 1-400) + 20 (from 401-488) = 60. But wait, that seems too high because the total number of page numbers is 488, so the tens digit can't have 60 fours. Let me check again. Maybe I'm overcounting. Let's think differently. For each position, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated using a formula. For the tens place, the number of times a digit d appears in the tens place up to n can be calculated as follows: Let\u2019s break down the number into hundreds, tens, and units. For the tens digit, we can consider the higher part and the lower part. The formula is: count = higher_part * 10 + (if current digit > d then 1 else 0) * (lower_part + 1) + something... Wait, maybe it's better to use a different approach. Let's consider the tens place. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 exactly 10 times. How many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, there are 10 fours in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), how many fours are there in the tens place? The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 more. So, total fours in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. Okay, that makes sense. So, units place: 49 fours, tens place: 50 fours. Now, hundreds place: 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but actually, each number from 400-488 has 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so no fours in the hundreds place. From 100-399, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, so no fours. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Units place: from 1-488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. So, 484 is 484, which is the 49th occurrence (since 484 / 10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers). So, 49 fours in the units place. Tens place: as calculated earlier, 50 fours. So, total fours: 89 + 49 + 50 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, we'll check units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is 488, which is the units digit. So, 488 is the 49th number (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 49 numbers). So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but our book ends at 488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. From 401-488: 480-488 \u2192 how many? 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9). So, in the tens place, from 401-488, we have 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4\u00d710 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 401-488) = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems. Let me verify the fours count again. Units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. Total: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. For eights: Units place: 49. Tens place: 49. Hundreds place: 0. Total: 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of 4's: 49 (since 484 / 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In each hundred block (e.g., 1-100, 101-200), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49).\n   - There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - In 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (440-449).\n   - Total in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - Total in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of 8's: 49 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In each hundred block, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89).\n   - There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - In 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480-488).\n   - Total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1-100: 10 numbers (40-49). From 101-200: another 10 (140-149). Similarly, 201-300: 10 (240-249). 301-400: 10 (340-349). Then, 401-500 would have 10, but our book stops at 488, so in 401-488, how many numbers have 4 in the tens place? From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440 is included in 401-500, but since the book ends at 488, 440-449 is still within 488. So, each hundred has 10, and there are 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Wait, 301-400 is the fourth hundred, and then 401-488 is part of the fifth hundred, but only up to 488. So, in the tens place, we have 10 fours in each hundred block, and there are 4 full blocks (1-400). Then, from 401-488, how many? The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 4*10 + 10 = 50. Wait, no, that can't be right because from 1-400, it's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40, and then from 401-488, another 10, making it 50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, we have 89 fours. Wait, but that seems too high. Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. That's (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: Each hundred block has 10, so 4 blocks (1-400) contribute 4*10=40, and then from 401-488, another 10 (440-449). So, total 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The first is 8, last is 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units place. 2. **Tens place:** Each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 180-189 (10). From 201-300: 280-289 (10). From 301-400: 380-389 (10). From 401-488: 480-488, but wait, 480-489 would be the next set, but the book ends at 488. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, each hundred block contributes 10, but the last block (401-488) contributes only 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. Wait, let's see: 1-100:10, 101-200:10, 201-300:10, 301-400:10, 401-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me double-check my counting for fours and eights to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. So, 188-98=90.

Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. That's 5 blocks. But wait, the last block is only up to 488, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's fine. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 fours each = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 401-488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8, considering units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but let me check if 488 is included. 488 is the last page, so yes, 488 is included. So, starting from 8, every 10 numbers up to 488. So, 8, 18, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 201-300: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 301-400: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 401-488: 480-488. Now, how many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yes, that seems right.

    "text": " So, from 1-100: 10 numbers (40-49). From 101-200: another 10 (140-149). Similarly, from 201-300: 10 (240-249), and from 301-400: 10 (340-349). Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 401-488. So that's 10 more. So, total tens place fours: 10 (from 1-100) + 10 (101-200) + 10 (201-300) + 10 (301-400) + 10 (401-488) = 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. Each of these numbers has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, total fours = units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 0 to 488, how many multiples of 10 have 8 in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is included. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each block: - 1-100: 10 numbers (80-89). - 101-200: 10 (180-189). - 201-300: 10 (280-289). - 301-400: 10 (380-389). - 401-488: 480-488 is part of 401-488. How many numbers have 8 in the tens place here? From 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the tens place eights: 10 (1-100) + 10 (101-200) + 10 (201-300) + 10 (301-400) + 9 (401-488) = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place eights = 0. Therefore, total eights = units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in each block of 100 numbers for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).  \n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.  \n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in each block of 100 numbers for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).  \n   - The last block (480-488) has 9 occurrences.  \n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours are 10 * 5 = 50. Hmm, but wait, from 1-400, each hundred has 10, so 4 hundreds? Wait, no, let me think again. From 1-100: 10, 101-200:10, 201-300:10, 301-400:10, and 401-488:10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these numbers has 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each set of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count: From 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 101-200:180-189 (10 numbers). From 201-300:280-289 (10 numbers). From 301-400:380-389 (10 numbers). From 401-488:480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 1-400) and 1 set of 9 (from 401-488). So, 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, from 1-400, how many such blocks are there? There are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in the numbers 400-409, but wait, 400-409 is part of the 401-500 range, but since the book stops at 488, the tens digit 4 appears in 400-409 and 440-449. Wait, no, that's not correct because 400-409 is part of the 400-499 range, but the book only goes up to 488. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears in two blocks: 400-409 and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 2 * 10 = 20. But wait, from 1-400, we already counted 4 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, it's 2*10=20. So total fours in tens place would be 40 + 20 = 60? Wait, that doesn't sound right because from 1-400, each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, which is 88 numbers, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? It's in 400-409 (10 numbers) and 440-449 (another 10 numbers), but wait, 400-409 is part of the 1-400 range, so maybe I'm double-counting. Let me think again. The correct approach is to consider each hundred block separately. The hundreds blocks are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. In each of the first four blocks (1-100, etc.), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each, so 4*10=40. Now, in the 401-488 block, the tens digit 4 appears in two sets: 400-409 and 440-449. But wait, 400-409 is part of the 400-499 range, which is the fifth hundred block. However, our book only goes up to 488, so in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears in two sets: 400-409 and 440-449. Each of these sets has 10 numbers, so 2*10=20. Therefore, the total number of fours in the tens place is 40 (from the first four blocks) plus 20 (from the fifth block up to 488), totaling 60 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (60) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 60 = 109, 109 + 89 = 198. So, there are 198 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. To count how many, we can divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48, but since 488 is included, we need to check if 488 is the 49th occurrence. Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 8 in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many blocks of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, and then the 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but the book stops at 488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-400, there are four blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in this range. Therefore, total eights in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours than eights there are: 198 fours - 98 eights = 100. So, there are 100 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, how many sets is that? From 1-100: 1 set. Then 101-200: another, so that's 2 sets. 201-300: 3 sets. 301-400: 4 sets. 401-488: 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but hold on, the last set is 440-449, which is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place?

Now, adding up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484: 484 is 484, which is 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each hundred has 10, and there are 5 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488). So, 5\u00d710=50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488 with step 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is within 480-488, which is part of the 480-489 block, but since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except maybe the last one. Let's see: From 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 180-189 (10). From 201-300: 280-289 (10). From 301-400: 380-389 (10). From 401-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, how many eights? For the first four sets (1-400), each contributes 10 eights, so 4\u00d710=40. The last set (401-488) contributes 9 eights because 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place.

So, in the tens place, each hundred block up to 400 contributes 10 fours. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) would contribute 4 * 10 = 40 fours. But wait, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 401-410, 420-429, etc. Wait, no, 401-488 includes the 400s, so the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, 480-489, but our book stops at 488. So, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, which is 10 numbers, but since our book starts at 401, the first number is 401, so from 401-409, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Then, 410-419: tens digit is 1, so no. 420-429: tens digit is 2, no. 430-439: tens digit is 3, no. 440-449: tens digit is 4, so 10 numbers. Similarly, 450-459: tens digit 5, no. 460-469: tens digit 6, no. 470-479: tens digit 7, no. 480-488: tens digit 8, so no. So, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 in two blocks: 400-409 (9 numbers, since 400 is included but our book starts at 401) and 440-449 (10 numbers). So, 9 + 10 = 19 fours in the tens place in the 400s. But wait, earlier I thought each hundred block contributes 10 fours, but in reality, the 400s contribute more because the tens digit is 4 in two blocks: 400-409 and 440-449. So, perhaps my initial approach was incorrect. Let me try a different way. The number of times the tens digit is 4 is calculated by looking at each hundred block. Each hundred block (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has exactly 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49 in 1-100). So, from 1-400, there are 4 hundred blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 4 * 10 = 40 fours in the tens place. Now, from 401-488, how many more fours are there in the tens place? Let's see: 400-488 is part of the 400s. The tens digit is 4 in 400-409 and 440-449. So, 400-409: 10 numbers, but since our book starts at 401, that's 9 numbers (401-409). 440-449: 10 numbers. So, 9 + 10 = 19 fours in the tens place in the 400s beyond the initial 400. Wait, but 400 is included in the 400s, but our book starts at 401. So, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409 and 440-449. So, 400-409 is 10 numbers, but since our book starts at 401, we have 9 numbers where the tens digit is 4 in that block. Similarly, 440-449 is another 10 numbers. So, total in the 400s: 9 + 10 = 19 fours. But wait, the initial 400s would have been counted as part of the 4 hundred blocks (each contributing 10 fours). Wait, no, because each hundred block is 100 numbers, and 400-500 is another hundred block, but our book stops at 488. So, perhaps I should consider that from 1-400, there are 4 hundred blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Then, from 401-488, which is 88 numbers, how many fours in the tens place? As before, 400-409: 10 numbers, but 401-409 is 9 numbers. 440-449: 10 numbers. So, 9 + 10 = 19 fours. Therefore, total fours in the tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 19 (from 401-488) = 59 fours. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because 400-488 is part of the 400s, which was already counted in the 4 hundred blocks. Maybe I'm double-counting. Let me think again. The correct approach is to consider each hundred block separately. Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) has 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4 blocks * 10 = 40 fours. Now, in the 401-500 block, but our book only goes up to 488. In this block, the tens digit is 4 in two places: 400-409 (but since we start at 401, it's 401-409, which is 9 numbers) and 440-449 (10 numbers). So, total in this partial block: 9 + 10 = 19 fours. Therefore, total fours in the tens place: 40 + 19 = 59. So, units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 59 fours. Now, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (59) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 59 = 108, 108 + 89 = 197 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? It's the same as the number of times 8 appears in the units place, which is every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so in the 480-489 block, we only go up to 488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-400, there are 4 hundred blocks, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40 eights. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488). So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours: 197, total eights: 98. The difference is 197 - 98 = 99. Wait, that can't be right because 197 - 98 is 99, but let me double-check my counts because I might have made a mistake. Let me recount the fours in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct: 89 fours. Units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 59 fours. So, 49 + 59 = 108, plus 89 is 197. For eights: units place 49, tens place 49, so 98. So, 197 - 98 = 99. Hmm, but I feel like that might be too high. Let me check the tens place for fours again. When counting the tens place for fours, I considered 400-409 and 440-449 in the 400s. So, 400-409: 10 numbers, but since the book starts at 401, that's 9 numbers. 440-449: 10 numbers. So, 19 fours in the tens place in the 400s beyond the initial 400. But wait, the initial 400s were already counted in the 4 hundred blocks (1-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, in the 400s, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409 and 440-449. So, in the 400s, that's 19 fours in the tens place. But the initial 400s were part of the 4 hundred blocks, so maybe I should not add those 19 fours again. Wait, no, because each hundred block contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so from 1-400, that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Then, in 401-488, which is part of the 400s, we have additional 19 fours in the tens place. So, total fours in the tens place: 40 + 19 = 59. That seems correct. Similarly, for eights in the tens place, from 1-400, it's 4 * 10 = 40 eights. Then, from 401-488, it's 9 eights in the tens place (480-488). So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the total fours are 197, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 99. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check: from 400-488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? It's every number from 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: 49 (units) + 59 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 197. Eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So, 197 - 98 = 99. Therefore, there are 99 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, this happens 49 times (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers within each hundred. From 1 to 400, there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 40. In the 400-488 range, 4 appears in the tens place 19 times (401-409 and 440-449).\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\n   **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 59 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 197.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers within each hundred. From 1 to 400, this happens 40 times. In the 400-488 range, it appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8.\n\n   **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 197 - 98 = 99.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{99}"

From 401-500: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. But wait, the book ends at 488, so the last block is 401-488. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 10 (from 1-100) + 10 (101-200) + 10 (201-300) + 10 (301-400) + 10 (401-488) \u2192 that's 50 fours. Wait, but 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 50 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but wait, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-499, but since our book ends at 488, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times this happens. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. Wait, but 488 is included, so from 8 to 488, that's 49 numbers. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. From 401-500: 480-489 \u2192 but our book ends at 488, so in 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, let's add these up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours: 188, total eights: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each step again. For fours: units place, from 4,14,...484. That's 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: each 100 has 10, so 400-488 is the last block, which is 10 numbers (440-449). So, 5 blocks of 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct. For eights: units place, 8,18,...488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " So, from 1-100: 10 fours in the tens place (40-49). Similarly, 101-200: 10 fours (140-149). 201-300: 10 fours (240-249). 301-400: 10 fours (340-349). 401-488: 10 fours (440-449). Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. Each hundred block (e.g., 1-99, 100-199, etc.) has a hundreds digit of 4 only in 400-499. But since the book ends at 488, it's 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up the fours in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the fours, the 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set. From 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). 101-200: 180-189 (10). 201-300: 280-289 (10). 301-400: 380-389 (10). 401-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the first four sets (80-89, etc.) each have 10 eights, so 4*10=40. The last set has 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights in each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490), each contributing one 4 in the units place. Additionally, 484 is the 49th occurrence. Thus, there are 49 fours in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** In each hundred block (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). There are 5 such blocks up to 488 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488). Each block contributes 10 fours, totaling 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. Thus, there are 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total fours:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, similar to 4. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Additionally, 488 is the 49th occurrence. Thus, there are 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** In each hundred block, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89). There are 4 such blocks up to 400 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), contributing 40 eights. In the 401-488 block, the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Thus, there are 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, which are beyond 488.

    "text": " So, from 1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 201-300: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 301-400: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 401-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, total in tens place: 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but let me confirm. Each hundred block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, from 1-400, that's 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, from 401-488, we have another 10 fours in 440-449. So, total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-499. But our book goes up to 488, so it's 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 89 fours. Wait, but let me double-check. The hundreds digit is 4 for 400-499, but since we only go up to 488, it's 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. Total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, but let me think again. Wait, when counting the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. Units place: every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 units place fours. Similarly, tens place: each hundred block has 10 fours, and we have 5 hundred blocks up to 488 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488). Wait, but 401-488 isn't a full hundred, but the tens place still has 10 fours in 440-449. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50, which is correct. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 eights in the units place. Wait, but let me check: starting from 8, 18, ..., 488. The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. From 401-488: 480-488 \u2192 how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, total tens place eights: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me confirm. Each hundred block up to 400 contributes 10 eights, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Wait, that seems lower than I expected. Let me double-check. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. Hundreds place: 0. Total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours and eights separately.\n\nFirst, fours:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nEights:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for eights. Let me check again. In the tens place, eights occur in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's five sets. Each of the first four sets (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 eights, and the last set (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for fours in the tens place, it's 5 sets of 10, so 50.\n\nSo, the counts seem accurate. Therefore, the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 4, 14, ..., up to 484. This gives 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in each block of 100 numbers, contributing 10 occurrences per block. With 5 such blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488), we get 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 8, 18, ..., up to 488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in each block of 100 numbers, contributing 10 occurrences per block. With 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and 9 occurrences in 480-488, we get 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8, so 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, for each hundred, there are 10 such numbers. Now, from 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds do we have? We have 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, the first four hundreds (1-400) each have 10 numbers with tens digit 4, so that's 4 x 10 = 40. Now, the last part is 401-488. How many numbers here have the tens digit as 4? Let's see: 401-409: tens digit is 0. 410-419: tens digit is 1. 420-429: tens digit is 2. 430-439: tens digit is 3. 440-449: tens digit is 4. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. Wait, but 400-499 would have 50, but we're only going up to 488, so does that affect the count? Wait, no, because 440-449 is within 401-488. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. Each of these numbers has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, total number of fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: every 10 numbers have one 4, so from 1-488, there are 48 full decades (each 10 numbers) and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, units place: 48 full decades give 48 fours, and then in 481-488, the units digit is 1-8, so no additional fours. So, units place is 48 fours. Wait, earlier I thought it was 49, but maybe it's 48. Let me clarify. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 fours. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) don't include a 4 in the units place, so total units fours are 48. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by counting 49. So, units place: 48 fours. Tens place: as before, each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 x 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens fours: 40 + 10 = 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds fours: 89. Now, total fours: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187. Wait, 48+50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. Hmm, that's different from my initial 188. So, I think I made a mistake earlier in the units place count. So, total fours are 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 eights. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included, which is an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more 8. So, total units eights: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4 x 10 = 40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit is 8 in all these 9 numbers. So, total tens eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, hundreds eights: 0. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours are 187, total eights are 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\) (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, taking the integer part).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In each block of 100 numbers, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - From 1-400: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 occurrences.\n   - From 401-488: 440-449 contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - From 400-488: 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\), plus one more in 488.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = **49**.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In each block of 100 numbers, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n   - From 1-400: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 occurrences.\n   - From 401-488: 480-488 contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = **49**.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: **0**.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **89**.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **89**.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " So, how many such blocks are there? From 1-100: 10 numbers (40-49). From 101-200: 10 numbers (140-149). From 201-300: 10 numbers (240-249). From 301-400: 10 numbers (340-349). From 401-488: 10 numbers (440-449). Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-499. But since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll go through each digit position similarly. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many such numbers? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each block. From 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 201-300: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 301-400: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 401-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the hundreds place for 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. So, adding up: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, from 1-100: 10 numbers (40-49). From 101-200: another 10 (140-149). Similarly, 201-300: 10 (240-249). 301-400: 10 (340-349). Now, 401-488: 40-49 in this block would be 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 440-449 fall within 401-488? Yes, because 440 is within 401-488. So, how many blocks of 100 are there? From 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. Wait, 401-488 is only 88 numbers, but the tens digit being 4 in 401-488 would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in total, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? 5 times 10, which is 50. Wait, no, because the last block is 401-488, which only goes up to 488, but 440-449 is within that, so it's 10 numbers. So, 10 (from 1-100) + 10 (101-200) + 10 (201-300) + 10 (301-400) + 10 (401-488) = 50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers are there? The last occurrence is at 488, which is the units digit. So, starting from 8, every 10 numbers up to 488. To find how many, divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, from 1-488, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 1-100: 10 numbers (80-89). 101-200: 10 (180-189). 201-300: 10 (280-289). 301-400: 10 (380-389). 401-488: Now, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, how many in the tens place? 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit. There are 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, from 1-100, 40-49 is 10 numbers. Similarly, 101-200: 140-149 is another 10, and so on. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500. But the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 401-488. So, from 1-400, there are four blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. That's 4*10=40 fours. Now, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 401-488 is only 88 numbers, so 440-449 is within that range. So, yes, that's 10 more, making it 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. How many terms? The formula is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let's count how many blocks: 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). 101-200: 180-189 (10). 201-300: 280-289 (10). 301-400: 380-389 (10). 401-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so only 9 numbers here. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (4*10=40) plus 9 from 480-488. So, 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place eights are 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th number where the units digit is 8. Wait, but 488 is within the page numbers, so yes, it counts. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many sets there are. Each 100 numbers has one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 180-189 (10). From 201-300: 280-289 (10). From 301-400: 380-389 (10). From 401-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last one. So, that's 9 numbers instead of 10. So, how many eights in the tens place? Let's see: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check again. From 1-100: 10. 101-200: 10. 201-300: 10. 301-400: 10. 401-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 10*4 +9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts because 90 seems like a big difference. Let me recount the 4's and 8's. Starting with 4's: Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is (Last - First)/Step +1. So, (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: Each hundred block has 10, and there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, 401-488: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 +10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is the units digit 8 in 488. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers add another 8. The number of such numbers is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many tens places have 8. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. From 401-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, yes, 9 eights in the tens place for the last block. So total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

From 401-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, total tens places with 4 are 10 * 5 = 50? Wait, but let me check: 1-100: 10, 101-200:10, 201-300:10, 301-400:10, 401-488:10. That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Hmm, but wait, 400-499 would be another set, but our book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, let me add up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Hmm, 49 + 50 = 99, yes, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the units place. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count: 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. 101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. 201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. 301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. 401-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total tens places with 8 are 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, because the last block only has 9 numbers, not 10. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds places with 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake. Let me recount the fours and eights in the tens and units places. For fours: units place: 4,14,...,484 \u2192 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449 \u2192 each has 10, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488 \u2192 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488 \u2192 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488 \u2192 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total eights: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. For eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 49 in total. So, yes, 98 eights. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I thought about the tens place for fours, I considered 5 sets of 10, but the last set is 440-449, which is within 400-488, so that's correct. Similarly, for eights, the last set in tens place is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 49 in total. So, yes, 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers within each hundred (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).  \n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488).  \n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\( 49 \\) (units) + \\( 50 \\) (tens) + \\( 89 \\) (hundreds) = \\( 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers within each hundred (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).  \n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences, except the last hundred, which contributes 9 (480-488).  \n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 0 \\).\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\( 49 \\) (units) + \\( 49 \\) (tens) + \\( 0 \\) (hundreds) = \\( 98 \\).\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**  \n\\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " There are 488 pages, so let's see how many complete hundreds we have. From 1-400, there are four blocks of 100: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 401-410? Wait, no. Wait, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which would be in 401-410? No, wait, that's the units digit. Wait, no, the tens digit is the second digit from the right. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 in 401-410, 1 in 411-420, and so on. Wait, but 401-488 is from 401 to 488. Let me think differently. The tens digit is 4 in 400-409, but 400 is part of the 301-400 block. Wait, no, 400 is part of the 1-400 range. Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me think of it as each hundred block contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, from 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 40 fours. Then, from 401-488, how many tens digits are 4? The next set after 400 would be 400-499, but our book stops at 488. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 401-410? Wait, no, because 401-410 have the tens digit as 0 (since 401 is 4 0 1, 402 is 4 0 2, etc.), and 411-420 have tens digit 1, and so on. Wait, actually, in 400-499, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, right? Because 440-449 is when the tens digit is 4. But 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours would be 40 (from 1-400) plus 10 (from 440-449) = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is part of 400-499, which we've already counted in the 1-400 blocks? Hmm, maybe I'm double-counting. Wait, no, because the 400-499 block isn't fully included. Let me correct this. The 1-400 range includes 400, so the tens digit 4 in 400 is part of that. But 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's an additional 10 fours. So, total tens place fours would be 40 (from 1-400) plus 10 (from 440-449) = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is 488, so the units digit is 8. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, the number of 8's in the units place is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets we have. Each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. From 1-400, there are four blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4 * 10 = 40 eights. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. Therefore, total tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's are printed: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (4, 14, 24, ..., 484):**\n   - There are 49 occurrences (from 4 to 484, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens Place (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449):**\n   - Each hundred block contributes 10 fours, totaling 40 from 1-400.\n   - From 401-488, 440-449 adds another 10.\n   - Total: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place (400-488):**\n   - 89 numbers (400 to 488) have 4 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (8, 18, 28, ..., 488):**\n   - There are 49 occurrences (from 8 to 488, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens Place (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488):**\n   - Each hundred block contributes 10 eights, totaling 40 from 1-400.\n   - From 401-488, 480-488 adds 9.\n   - Total: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

No, 400 is part of 401-500, but since we're only going up to 488, the 440-449 is correct. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-499. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 occurrences because 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count: Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. From 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. From 401-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

    "text": " There are four such blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-500. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 401-488, so the tens digit 4 in 400-488 would only be from 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but our book stops at 488. So, in each block, the number of tens digits being 4 is 10 per block, except maybe the last one if it's cut off. Let me think: from 1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10. From 201-300: 240-249 \u2192 10. From 301-400: 340-349 \u2192 10.

But the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, 410-419, etc., but actually, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, etc., but that's not correct. Wait, no. The tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, but that's not right because 400-409 has tens digit 0, 410-419 has tens digit 1, etc. Wait, no, that's not correct. I think I made a mistake here. Let me correct that. The tens digit is 4 in numbers where the second digit is 4. So, in 1-100, it's 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10. In 201-300, it's 240-249, 10. In 301-400, it's 340-349, 10. Now, in 401-500, it's 440-449, which would be another 10, but our book ends at 488, so 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total tens digits with 4 are 10 (1-100) + 10 (101-200) + 10 (201-300) + 10 (301-400) + 10 (401-488) = 50. Wait, but 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 50 in total. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units: 4,14,...,484: that's 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens: each 100 block has 10, and there are 5 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488). Wait, but 401-488 is only 88 numbers, but the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89. So, total 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 /10 = 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count: Each block of 100 contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10. 101-200: 180-189 \u219210. 201-300:280-289\u219210. 301-400:380-389\u219210. 401-488:480-488\u21929 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9. So, total tens digits with 8 are 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits with 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counting for 4's and 8's to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: Units place: 4,14,...,484 \u2192 484 -4 = 480, 480/10=48, plus 1 for the starting number, so 49. Tens place: Each 100 block has 10, and there are 5 blocks (1-100,101-200,201-300,301-400,401-488). Wait, but in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks \u00d710=50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488 \u2192 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1=49. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last contributes 9, so 4\u00d710 +9=49. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's=49+49=98. Therefore, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

There are four complete hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40. In the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights printed: 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems off. Let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems a bit high. Let me recount the fours and eights again. For fours: Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Tens place: Each hundred has 10, so 4 hundreds = 40, plus in 400-488, the tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is 10. So 40 +10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So 49+50+89=188. For eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Tens place: Each hundred has 10, so 4*10=40, plus in 400-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So 40+9=49. Hundreds place: 0. So 49+49=98. So 188-98=90. Hmm, maybe it's correct. Wait, but when I think about the hundreds place for fours, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's a significant number. Maybe 90 is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the tens place for eights. Let me check: In the tens place, for eights, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So that's correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in each block of 100 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449). There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in each block of 100 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488). There are 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488. There are 0 occurrences.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1-100: 10 numbers (40-49), 101-200: 10 (140-149), 201-300: 10 (240-249), 301-400: 10 (340-349), and 401-488: 10 (440-449). Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, contributing 89 fours. Now, let's add up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in units place is (488 // 10) + 1 if the remainder is >=4. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so the number of 4's in units place is 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. From 1-100: 10, 101-200:10, 201-300:10, 301-400:10, and 401-488:10 (since 440-449 is within 401-488). So, 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours: 5 x 10 = 50. That's correct. Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but the last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Similar to fours, in each hundred block, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10). So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, tens place contributes 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, number of fours is 188, and number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check the counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
