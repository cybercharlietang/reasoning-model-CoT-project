    "text": " Let me see how many full blocks there are. From 1 to 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. That's correct. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is included. So, how many such numbers? Let's see, starting at 8, each 10 numbers. The last one is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full block (like 80-89) contributes 10 eights. There are 4 full blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each with 10 eights, so 40. Then, the last partial block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, 9 eights in the tens place here. So total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the eights in the tens place. The sets are 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 4 full sets and one partial. 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That's correct. So, total eights: 49+49=98. Fours: 188. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each full block contributes 10 occurrences, with the last partial block contributing 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me see how many complete sets of 100 there are in 488. There are 4 complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers (400-409). Wait, but 400-409 is 10 numbers, so that's another 10 fours. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more fours. So, total in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, 8,18,...,488: yes, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. From 1-400: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 9 eights in the tens place. So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of 4's: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{484}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - From 1-400: 4 sets of 10, totaling \\(4 \\times 10 = 40\\).\n   - From 400-488: 400-409, adding 10 more.\n   - Total in tens place: \\(40 + 10 = 50\\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, totaling \\(488 - 400 + 1 = 89\\).\n\n**Total 4's:** \\(49 + 50 + 89 = 188\\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of 8's: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - From 1-400: 4 sets of 10, totaling \\(4 \\times 10 = 40\\).\n   - From 400-488: 480-488, adding 9 more.\n   - Total in tens place: \\(40 + 9 = 49\\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\(49 + 49 = 98\\).\n\n**Difference:** \\(188 - 98 = 90\\).\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me see: from 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, 488 is included, so it's actually 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total.

    "text": " Let me see: from 1-99, the tens place 4 occurs in 40-49, which is 10 times. From 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10 times. Similarly, 240-249 is another 10, and 340-349 is another 10. Then, 440-449 is another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 times. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, let me add them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. If I divide 488 by 10, that's 48.8, so 48 full sets, which would give 48 eights. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full decades and then 8 more numbers. But 488 is included, so the number of 8's in the units place is 49. Wait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me think again: from 1 to 488, how many multiples of 10 plus 8 are there? It's the floor of (488 - 8)/10 + 1. So, (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place, except the last block, which might be cut short. So, from 1-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is another 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is another 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is another 10. Now, from 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that's 98 eights? Wait, let me check again because I might have made a mistake. For the tens place, I had 10 in each of the first four blocks (1-399) and 9 in the last block (400-488). So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49. Units place was 49, so total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of 4's was 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units place had 49, tens had 50, hundreds had 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. For the 8's: units place had 49, tens had 49, hundreds had 0. 49 + 49 is 98. So, 188 - 98 is indeed 90.

    "text": " Let's see how many complete sets of 100 there are. From 1 to 488, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each complete hundred, the tens place has 10 fours. So, 4 hundreds * 10 = 40 fours. Now, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens place has 4 in 440-449. That's 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, which would be 48 fours, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 fours because the 48th set ends at 480, and then 484 is the next one. So, units: 49. Tens place: as before, 40 (from 1-400) plus 10 (from 440-449) = 50. Hundreds place: 89 (400-488). So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which would be 48 eights, but since 488 is included, it's 49 eights. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each set. From 1-488: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, yes, that's correct. So, tens place: 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me check the tens place again. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each hundred block (like 0-99, 100-199, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-400, there are 4 such blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. So, yes, that's correct. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - From 1-400: 40 occurrences.\n   - From 440-449: 10 occurrences.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - From 1-400: 40 occurrences.\n   - From 480-488: 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No 8's in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let's see, from 1-488, how many full decades are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so it's 1-400, 401-500, but 500 isn't included. Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of how many times 4 appears in the tens place. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. From 1-400, that would be 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40 times. But wait, 400-488 is part of the 400s, so from 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, 400-488 includes 400-488, which is 89 numbers. But the tens digit in 400-488 is 0 for 400-409, 1 for 410-419, up to 8 for 480-488. So, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's are 4*10 (from 1-400) plus 10 (from 400-488), but wait, no, because 400-488 includes the 400s, which we've already counted as 4*10. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's every 100 numbers, 10 times. So, 488 divided by 100 is 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40. But wait, 400-488 is part of the 400s, so in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total tens place 4's are 4*10=40, but wait, that's only up to 400. From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is another 10 times, so total is 50. Wait, no, that can't be right because 488 is less than 500. Let me correct this. From 1-400, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, that's 5 sets of 10 numbers, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is within 1-488, so that's correct. So, total tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in page numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many terms? From 8 to 488 with a common difference of 10. The formula for the number of terms is ((last - first)/difference) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 400s. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so in each hundred, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers. From 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40 times. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, in the 400s, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 400-488) = 40+9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total tens place 8's: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (from 4 to 484).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such sets (1-400 and 400-488).\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences, except the last set which contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think: from 1-99, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then from 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10. 300-399: 340-349, 10. 400-488: 440-449, but wait, 449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? So, 10 each for 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 times, so 5*10=50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers (since 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting at 8). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. From 1-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189, 10. 200-299:280-289,10. 300-399:380-389,10. 400-488:480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " Wait, let me think. From 1-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10. So that's 10 per hundred, and how many hundreds do we have? From 1-400, that's four hundreds, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So 4 x 10 = 40. But wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10, so yes, 40 in total. So, tens place contributes 40 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can only have 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in the hundreds place, every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So that's 89 fours. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89; 89 + 89 = 178. So, total number of 4's is 178. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let's count: From 1-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is 10. From 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 178 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 80. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 40, hundreds 89. 49 + 40 = 89, plus 89 is 178. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 178 - 98 = 80. Hmm, but I feel like I might have made a mistake in the tens place for fours. Let me check that again. Tens place for fours: from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Wait, earlier I thought it was 40. Oh no, I think I made a mistake there. Wait, from 1-400, how many sets of 100 are there? 4 sets: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40. But wait, 400-488 is another set where the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. So that's another 10, making it 50. So, the tens place for fours is actually 50, not 40. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. So, units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, that's different. Let me recount the tens place for fours. From 1-99: 40-49 is 10. 100-199: 140-149 is 10. 200-299: 240-249 is 10. 300-399: 340-349 is 10. 400-488: 440-449 is 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. So, earlier I thought it was 40, but it's actually 50. So, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. Now, for the eights, let's check again. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. Hundreds place: 0. So, total eights: 49 + 49 = 98. So, the difference is 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that's different from before. So, I think I made a mistake earlier in counting the tens place for fours. It's 50, not 40. So, the correct total fours is 188, eights is 98, so the difference is 90. But wait, let me make sure about the tens place for fours. From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, that's correct. So, 5 sets of 10, 50. So, fours total is 188, eights is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. But wait, let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? It's all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, yes, that's correct. So, the total fours are 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but earlier I thought the answer was 80, but now it's 90. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial count. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcounting somewhere. Let me try another approach. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately, making sure I don't miss any. Let's do it systematically.\n\nFirst, for the number of 4's:\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n   - The first occurrence is 4, then 14, 24, ..., up to 484.\n   - To find the count, divide 488 by 10: 488 / 10 = 48.8. So, there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4, and then an additional 4 in 484.\n   - Wait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but the remainder is 8, which is less than 4, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence.\n   - So, units place: 49 fours.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4.\n   - So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours: 5 x 10 = 50 fours.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The 4 appears in the hundreds place in the range 400-488.\n   - From 400 to 488, there are 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - So, hundreds place: 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, for the number of 8's:\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, the last occurrence is at 488.\n   - So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, and an additional 8 at 488.\n   - So, units place: 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers.\n   - The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488).\n   - So, total tens place eights: 4 x 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only in 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n   - So, hundreds place: 0 eights.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the difference is 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 80, but after correcting the tens place for fours, it's 90. So, the correct answer should be 90. But let me make sure I didn't make any other mistakes.\n\nWait, let me recount the tens place for fours. From 40-49: 10 numbers. 140-149: 10. 240-249: 10. 340-349: 10. 440-449: 10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 fours, so 50. Correct.\n\nFor eights, tens place: 80-89: 10. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, 40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for fours: 49, correct. Units place for eights:49, correct.\n\nHundreds place for fours:89, correct. Hundreds place for eights:0, correct.\n\nSo, total fours:188, eights:98. Difference:90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because initially I thought it was 80, but after correcting, it's 90. So, I think 90 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can write a small program or use another method to verify, but since I can't do that right now, I'll try to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units digit:\n\n- For both 4 and 8, they appear once every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, the number of times each digit appears in the units place is floor(488/10) +1 if the digit is <= the units digit of 488. Since 488 ends with 8, for digit 8, it's 49, and for digit 4, it's also 49 because 488 >=4. So, units place: 49 each.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\n- For digit 4: it appears in the tens place in 40-49, 140-149, etc., as before, which is 5 sets of 10, so 50.\n- For digit 8: it appears in 80-89, 180-189, etc., which is 4 full sets of 10 and one partial set of 9, so 49.\n\nFor hundreds digit:\n\n- Digit 4: appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n- Digit 8: doesn't appear in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\nFours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nEights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm overcounting in the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? It's all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the correct answer is 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (1-488):** The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens Place (1-488):** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place (1-488):** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\n   **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place (1-488):** The digit '8' appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens Place (1-488):** The digit '8' appears in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place (1-488):** There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place.\n\n   **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - **Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's. \n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's printed is 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups of 10, but since 488 is the last page, it's included. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, how many numbers? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the book, so let's count each set. - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, is that right? Let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, total number of 8's printed is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. When counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488-480+1=9. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then 480-488 is 9, so total 40+9=49. That seems correct. So, 49 in tens place. Units place: 49, so total 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I overcounted the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check: hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 numbers where hundreds digit is 4. That's correct. So, yes, 89. So, total 4's: 49+50+89=188. 8's: 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, from 1-400, how many sets of 100 are there? 4 sets: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40 fours. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, adding that, 40 + 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Hmm, but wait, 400-488 includes 400-499, but the book stops at 488. So, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours are 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is 488. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers, so 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let me count each set. From 1-400, how many sets have 8 in the tens place? Each hundred has one set: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488. That's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " Let me think. From 1-99: 40-49, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, 10. From 300-399: 340-349, 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 each for five blocks, but wait, from 400-488, 440-449 is only 10 numbers, and 450-488 doesn't have another 4 in the tens place. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, totaling 5*10=50 fours. Wait, but let me check the last block: 400-488. The tens digit is 4 only from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, that's correct. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. To find how many, divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. So, 48 full groups of 10, each contributing an 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. From 1-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, 10. From 200-299: 280-289, 10. From 300-399: 380-389, 10. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89.\n   \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " Let me think: from 1 to 488, how many full decades of 100 are there? There are 4 full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, no, 400-488 is part of the fifth hundred, but it's only up to 488. So, for the tens place, in each hundred, the 40-49 range contributes 10 fours. So, how many hundreds are there? Let's see: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, that's five segments, but only the first four have a full 40-49 range. The fifth segment is 401-488, which includes 401-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. Wait, so in 401-488, the tens place is 0 for 401-409, 1 for 410-419, etc., up to 8 for 480-488. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 4 full hundreds (each contributing 10 fours) plus the 10 in 440-449. Wait, no, because 401-488 is part of the fifth hundred, but it's only up to 488. So, in each hundred from 1-100, 101-200, etc., the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times each. How many hundreds are there? Let's see: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, that's five segments, but the first four each have a full 40-49 range, contributing 10 fours each. The fifth segment, 401-488, includes 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours: 4*10 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 401-488 is the fifth hundred, but it's not a full hundred. So, does that mean the tens digit 4 appears 10 times in each of the first four hundreds and 10 times in the fifth hundred's 440-449? So, 4*10 + 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488, which is 48*10 + 8. So, how many 8's in the units place? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full hundred (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has a block where the tens digit is 8, contributing 10 eights. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: 1-100: 80-89 (10 eights). 101-200: 180-189 (10). 201-300: 280-289 (10). 301-400: 380-389 (10). 401-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but there are only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many eights in the tens place? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) each contribute 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Units place: 49 eights, tens place: 49 eights, so total 98 eights.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place was 49, but let me check that again. Units place: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, numbers are 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The last term is 488, which is 48*10 +8, so the number of terms is 49. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place: 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) each have 10 eights, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98.\n\nNow, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours. Let me recount the fours:\n\nUnits place: from 4,14,24,...,484. How many numbers? The last number is 484, which is 48*10 +4. So, the number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 fours in units place.\n\nTens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these contributes 10 fours. How many such blocks? Let's see:\n\n- 40-49: 10 fours\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249:10\n- 340-349:10\n- 440-449:10\n\nSo, that's 5 blocks, each with 10 fours, totaling 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488. How many numbers? 488 -400 +1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total fours: 49 +50 +89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor eights:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,...,488. 49 numbers.\n\nTens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nSo, total eights:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I thought about the hundreds place for fours, I considered 400-488 as 89 numbers, but does that include 400? Yes, because 400 is included. So, 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place in fours, I considered 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 50.\n\nWait, but in the case of eights, in the tens place, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so only 9 eights instead of 10. That's why it's 49 instead of 50.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to miscount. Let me try another approach for units and tens.\n\nAnother way to count the number of times a digit appears in a certain position is to use the formula for each digit place.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in units place from 1 to N is:\n\nsum = (N // 10) * 1 + min(max(d, N % 10 + 1), d + 1)\n\nWait, maybe that's too formulaic. Alternatively, for units digit, it's straightforward: every 10 numbers, the digit appears once. So, for 488 pages, the number of times 4 appears in units place is floor(488/10)=48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus if the last partial cycle has 4 or above, add 1. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is greater than 4, so add 1. So, total 48 +1=49 fours in units place.\n\nSimilarly for 8's in units place: floor(488/10)=48, and 488 mod 10 is 8, which is equal to 8, so add 1. So, 48 +1=49 eights in units place.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in tens place from 1 to N can be calculated as:\n\nhigher = N // 100\ncurrent = (N // 10) % 10\nlower = N % 10\n\nif d < current:\n    count = (higher + 1) * 10\nelif d == current:\n    count = higher * 10 + lower + 1\nelse:\n    count = higher * 10\n\nBut maybe it's easier to think in terms of blocks.\n\nFor fours in tens place:\n\nEach hundred has a block where the tens digit is 4, contributing 10 fours. How many full hundreds are there? 4 (since 488 is less than 500). So, 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10. So, total 50 fours in tens place.\n\nFor eights in tens place:\n\nEach hundred has a block where the tens digit is 8, contributing 10 eights. How many full hundreds? 4, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 +9=49 eights in tens place.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor fours: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nFor eights: 800-899, but since N=488, there are 0 eights in hundreds place.\n\nSo, total fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers contributes a 4. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, let me add them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. I'll check each digit position again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 occurrences because 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 exist? Yes, since the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 would have 8's in the tens place. Let me count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so yes, 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, 49 + 49 is 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

    "text": " Let me see: from 1 to 488, how many full tens blocks are there? The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages. In each of these 4 full hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each. So that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Now, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 more. So, total fours in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48, but wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me see: 8, 18, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. In each full hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.), the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89). There are 4 full hundreds (1-400). So, 4 * 10 = 40 eights. Now, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98.

    "text": " Let's see: - 40-49: 10 numbers - 140-149: 10 numbers - 240-249: 10 numbers - 340-349: 10 numbers - 440-449: 10 numbers So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so all those are included. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 numbers - 280-289: 10 numbers - 380-389: 10 numbers - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me calculate how many complete decades there are. From 1 to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, for each hundred, like 0-99, 100-199, etc., the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, how many hundreds do we have? Up to 488, which is 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 488. Wait, actually, 488 is in the 400-488 range. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets of 10 numbers each, so 5*10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, tens place has 50 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is the fifth set, so 5*10=50. So, units place had 49, tens place 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, 488 is the units digit 8, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets are there? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? 484 /10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449: that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me see: from 1-488, how many full decades are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full centuries (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. In each of the first four centuries, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each, so that's 4*10 = 40. Now, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188.

The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488), because 488 is the last page. So, let's count: In each full hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times. From 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40. Now, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. Let's see: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts.

    "text": " Let's see: from 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, how many complete hundreds are there? 488 is less than 500, so we have four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, actually, 401-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but we stop at 488. So, for the tens place, each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. So, 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers). 101-200: 140-149 (10). 201-300: 240-249 (10). 301-400: 340-349 (10). Now, 401-488: 440-449 (10) and then 450-488.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 89 fours in the hundreds place.

So, 0-99: 10 fours in tens place. 100-199: another 10. 200-299: another 10. 300-399: another 10. 400-488: here, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440 is the 440th page, which is within 488. So, that's another 10. So, total in tens place: 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Wait, but 400-488 is the last set, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. That occurs in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, let me add up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, looking at units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8 in the tens place. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. From 0-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189, another 10. 200-299: 280-289, another 10. 300-399: 380-389, another 10. 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, we have 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, but let me confirm: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, each of the first four hundreds contributes 10, and the last contributes 9, so total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, no eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units (49), tens (50), hundreds (89) totaling 188. For eights: units (49), tens (49) totaling 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems right. I don't think I made a mistake in the counts.

    "text": " From 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, so 4*10=40 fours in the tens place. But wait, from 400-488, the tens place is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So total tens place fours would be 4*10 + 10 = 50? Wait, no, because 400-488 includes 400-488, which is 89 numbers. The tens place in 400-488 goes from 40-49, 140-149, etc., but wait, no, 400-488 is a different set. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49). Similarly, 101-200: 140-149, another 10. 201-300: 240-249, 10. 301-400: 340-349, 10. Then, 401-488: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit in 400-488 is 0-8, but when the tens digit is 4, it's 440-449. So yes, 10 more. So total tens place fours: 5*10=50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. So, from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers. So, 484 is the last one. (484-4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So units:49. Tens place: in each hundred, 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. From 1-400, that's 4 sets, 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens:40+10=50. Hundreds place: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours:49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The last number is 488. So, (488-8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** In each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. From 1-400, that's 4 sets, 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place in 401-488. So total tens place eights:40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0. So total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check. Fours:188, eights:98. Difference:90. Yes, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place for every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   Number of 4's in units place:  \n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{484}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each set of 100 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).  \n   Number of 4's in tens place:  \n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ sets of 100} \\times 10 + 10 \\text{ (from 440-449)} = 40 + 10 = 50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.  \n   Number of 4's in hundreds place:  \n   \\[\n   488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n   \\]\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\text{ (units)} + 50 \\text{ (tens)} + 89 \\text{ (hundreds)} = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the units place for every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   Number of 8's in units place:  \n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each set of 100 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-489).  \n   However, since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488, which has 9 numbers.  \n   Number of 8's in tens place:  \n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ sets of 100} \\times 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   Number of 8's in hundreds place:  \n   \\[\n   0\n   \\]\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\text{ (units)} + 49 \\text{ (tens)} + 0 \\text{ (hundreds)} = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**  \n\\[\n188 - 98 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Let me calculate how many complete blocks of 100 there are. From 1 to 488, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times each. That's 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, adding that, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 488 is beyond 449, but the tens digit beyond 449 in 450-488 is 5, 6, 7, 8, so no more 4's in the tens place beyond 449. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is 488, which is the units place. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let me count each block. Each complete hundred (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. There are 4 complete hundreds up to 400, so 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188-98 is 90, but let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems a bit high. Let me verify the counts again. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when counting the tens place for 4's, I considered 440-449 as part of the tens place, which is correct, giving 10 more, making it 50. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, I had 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49. That seems correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. Wait, but I feel like maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. So, yes, the total 4's are 188, 8's are 98, so the difference is 90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place for 4's. Let me recount the units place for 4's. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484. So, (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in the units place, which I had correct. Similarly, for 8's in the units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49, correct. So, yes, the difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each hundred block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Up to 400: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - In 401-488: 440-449 contributes 10.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each hundred block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Up to 400: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - In 401-488: 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- 4's: 188\n- 8's: 98\n- More 4's than 8's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488.

So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, did I do that right? Let me double-check my counts.

    "text": " Let me see: from 1 to 488, how many complete decades (sets of 100) do we have? The hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. But 0 would be 1-99, 1 is 100-199, etc. So, for the tens place, each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. So, from 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10).

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, let me add them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's.

The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the tens place as well. Let me count each set. From 1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 numbers. So, the tens place has 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. This is 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This is 89 occurrences.\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. This is 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me see: From 1 to 488, how many full sets of 100 are there? 4 full sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. In each of the first four sets, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49 in each set). So that's 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial set, 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's another 10. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check how many full sets we have. Up to 488, so 4 full sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). In each set, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89). So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial set, 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 more. So, total in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, let me double-check: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So yes, 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the total eights from total fours: 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " Let me think: from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 100 are there? Well, 488 is less than 500, so we have four complete sets: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, no, that's five sets. Wait, 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, in each of the first four sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each, so that's 4*10=40. Now, in the last set, 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, then 1 for 410-419, and so on up to 8 for 480-488. So, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that adds another 10, making it 40+10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 50 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400 is the first number with hundreds digit 4, and 488 is the last. So, from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each complete hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-400, that's four sets, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Now, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers: 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, that's 9 more, making it 40+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, total eights in the tens place are 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights are there. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let's see how many full decades there are. From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, 40-49 is one set (10 numbers), 140-149 is another (10), 240-249 is another (10), 340-349 is another (10), and 440-449 is another (10). That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full times, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 times. So, units: 49. Tens place: for each hundred, 10 numbers. From 1-488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit cycles again, so 40-49 in the 400s would be 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct. Hundreds place: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, each of the first four sets (80-89, etc.) gives 10 eights, so 4 x 10 = 40. The last set, 480-488, gives 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because 188 - 98 is 90, but I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the fours and eights. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct.

    "text": " Let me see: from 0-488, how many full decades are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds, but wait, the first hundred is 1-100, then 101-200, etc., up to 401-500, but since we only go to 488, the last hundred is 401-488. So, in each hundred, the tens place has 4 from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, which means 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, no, that's not right. Each number from 400-488 has 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.

Wait, but 480-489 would be another set, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, except possibly the last one. From 0-488, how many full tens with 8 in the tens place? The first is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189 (another 10), 280-289 (another 10), 380-389 (another 10), and 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed.

Wait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is 10, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, and 440-449 is 10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but wait, from 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 = 88, so 88 +1 =89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. To find how many, divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, the book goes up to 488, so let's see: From 1-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-489, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, for the hundreds place 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 10 (from 80-89) +10 (180-189)+10 (280-289)+10 (380-389)+9 (480-488)=10+10=20, 20+10=30, 30+10=40, 40+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, resulting in 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., but only up to 488, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let's see how many complete blocks there are. The first block is 1-99, which includes 40-49. That's 10 fours. Then, 100-199 includes 140-149, another 10 fours. 200-299 includes 240-249, another 10 fours. 300-399 includes 340-349, another 10 fours. Now, 400-488: the tens place can be 4 in 440-449, which is 10 fours. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, I'm only interested in the digit 4 in the hundreds place. So, every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Now, let me check that again because sometimes I might have double-counted or missed something. Wait, in the units place, I had 49 fours, which seems correct because from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers, so 484/10 = 48.4, but since 484 is included, it's 49. In the tens place, each block of 100 has 10 fours, and there are 5 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 isn't a full block; it's only up to 488. But in the tens place, the 4's occur in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 5 blocks with 10 each, 50 fours. Then, hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8's in the tens place occur in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place. So, 0-99: 80-89, 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189, 10 numbers. 200-299: 280-289, 10 numbers. 300-399: 380-389, 10 numbers. 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the tens place, the 8's occur 10 times in each of the first four blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), and 9 times in the last block (400-488). So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** The digit '4' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). This results in 49 occurrences (from 4 to 484).\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit):** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such ranges, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit):** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for all pages from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). This results in 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit):** The digit '8' appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. Each full range (except the last) contributes 10 occurrences, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit):** There are no pages where the hundreds digit is '8' since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - **Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1-400, how many sets are there? Well, 40-49 is the first set, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's included. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 488 is included, right? So, 488 is the last page, so yes, 488 is included. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours printed: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets are there? 80-89 is one set, 180-189 is another, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last set, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is the first, 481, 482, ..., 488: that's 9 numbers. So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. The fifth set (480-488) has 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights printed: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (from 0 to 484 inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in sets like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 occurrences, with 5 sets in total.\n   - Number of occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89 (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (from 0 to 488 inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in sets like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four sets contributes 10 occurrences, and the last set contributes 9.\n   - Number of occurrences: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " From 1-488, how many full decades are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first set, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see if 480-489 is included, but since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Each full set (e.g., 80-89) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many such sets are there? From 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 sets, each with 10 eights, so 4 * 10 = 40 eights. But wait, the last set is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 eights, and then the partial set 480-488 contributing 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? So, yes, 9 eights in the tens place from 480-488. So total tens eights: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but since our book ends at 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check the tens place for eights again. From 80-89: 10 eights. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. Then 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. Yes, that's correct. Similarly, for fours in the tens place, we had 5 sets: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each set gives 10 fours, so 5*10=50. And units place for fours: 4,14,...484. 484 is the 49th number because (484-4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, yes, units fours:49. Hundreds place fours:400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. So, 98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Let's count each block: - 1-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. - 100-199: 180-189 is another 10. - 200-299: 280-289 is another 10. - 300-399: 380-389 is another 10. - 400-488: 480-488. Now, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds:89. Total 188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but let me check the tens place for fours again. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, but when counting the tens digit as 4, we have 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's correct. For eights, in the tens place, from 400-488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct. Wait, but when counting units place for fours, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers has a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49. So, 49 fours in units place. Similarly for eights, same logic: 49. So, that seems correct. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the hundreds place, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For eights, hundreds place is zero, so that's correct. So, the total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188. Eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This is 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This is 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This is 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit since the book ends at 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me see: from 1-488, how many full decades are there? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. In each of the first four hundreds, the tens place has 4 in 40-49, so that's 10 numbers per hundred. So, 4 hundreds times 10 = 40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449. That's another 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but actually, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me check how many full hundreds we have. From 1-488, we have four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. In each full hundred, the tens digit 8 occurs in 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, 4 full hundreds give 4 x 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, does the tens digit 8 occur? Yes, in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. Therefore, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. 188 - 98 = 90. Yes, that seems right. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Let me calculate how many full blocks there are. From 1-488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so we have hundreds digits 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). For each of these, except the last one, the tens place 4 occurs 10 times. So, 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 fours. 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 fours. 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 fours. 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 fours. Now, 400-488: the tens digit is 4 from 440-449. That's 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours: 10 (from 0-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 50 fours. Wait, but wait, 400-488: does 440-449 fit within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Wait, 49 in units, 50 in tens, 89 in hundreds. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting units, I thought 484 is the last occurrence, which is 484, so that's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. That seems right. Tens place: each hundred block has 10, and there are 5 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10: that's (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, since the book goes up to 488, does 480-489 exist? Yes, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers \u2192 10 eights.\n- 180-189: 10 \u2192 10.\n- 280-289: 10 \u219210.\n- 380-389: 10 \u219210.\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive) \u21929 eights.\n\nWait, because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 eights in the tens place here.\n\nSo, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens eights: 4*10 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights.\n\nSo, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights.\n\nWait, so fours are 188, eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units: 4,14,...,484. That's 484-4=480, divided by 10 gives 48, plus 1 is 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block of 100 has 10, and there are 5 blocks (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). So, 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units: 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10, and the last one has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: 0.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So that's 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188.

Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10 numbers. 300-399: 340-349, 10 numbers. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers because 449 is within 488. So, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that is. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place has 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count these. From 1-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289, 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389, 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can only be 8 if the number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This is 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This is 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think: from 1-99, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then from 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10 numbers. 300-399: 340-349, 10 numbers. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, right? Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, from 40-49, 10; 140-149, 10; 240-249, 10; 340-349, 10; 440-449, 10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is 10, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, and 440-449 is 10. So that's 5 times 10, which is 50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but our book stops at 488, so it's 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is included. So, how many such numbers are there? The first is 8, the last is 488. To find how many, I can take 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's break it down: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, actually, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for 480-488. So, total eights in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, checking the fours:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484. The last number is 484, which is 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. That seems correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, and there are 5 such groups, so 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188. That seems right.\n\nNow, checking the eights:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. The last number is 488, which is 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, since the book doesn't reach 800. Correct.\n\nTotal eights: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, that seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total Fours:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No occurrences since the book doesn't reach 800.\n   - **Total Eights:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - More 4's than 8's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
