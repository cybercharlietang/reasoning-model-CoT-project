    "text": " Wait, 5 sets, each contributing 10 except the last one which contributes 9. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9: 4*10=40 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that can't be right because 49+49=98, but I'm not sure if I missed something. Wait, let me check the tens place again. From 80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. Then 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 in the tens place. Units place:49, so total eights:49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188-98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, number of 4's: units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. Number of 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the units place for 4's. Let me recount the units place for 4's. From 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484-4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Correct. Similarly, for 8's in units place: from 8 to 488, same calculation: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=49. Correct. Tens place for 4's: each hundred block has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. From 40-49, 140-149, etc. Up to 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. Tens place for 8's: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. So, 5 blocks, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 of 9: 4*10=40 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct. Hundreds place for 8's: none, as the book ends at 488. So, 0. Therefore, total fours:188, total eights:98. Difference:188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers.\n   \n   - **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n   \n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n   **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n   \n   - **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 5 such ranges, but the last range (480-488) has only 9 numbers. So, 4 ranges of 10 and 1 of 9, totaling 49.\n   \n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.\n\n   **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   \n   Number of '4's (188) minus number of '8's (98) equals 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 more times than the digit 8.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, each of the next three decades is 10, and 480-488 is 9 because 488 is the last page. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hmm, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is included. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188.

So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. That seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Wait, but let me double-check my counting, especially for the tens place in eights. I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so that set contributes 9 eights in the tens place, right? So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49, which seems correct. And for fours, the hundreds place is 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours there. Units place for fours: up to 484, which is the 49th occurrence. Tens place for fours: 5 sets of 10, so 50. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. Eights: units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right.

So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, but wait, in the tens place for eights, I had 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page. So, 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, that's correct. So, the total eights are 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, totaling 98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the hundreds place for fours? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Yep, that's 188. For eights, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 98.
