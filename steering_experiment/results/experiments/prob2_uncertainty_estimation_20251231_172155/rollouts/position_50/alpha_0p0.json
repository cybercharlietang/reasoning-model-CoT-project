So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, let me confirm that. Units:49, tens:49, so total 98.

So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4 and 8. For fours: Units place: from 4 to 484, that's (484-4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, etc., each block has 10, and there are 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). So 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. 49+50+89=188. For eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=48+1=49. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10, and the last block has 9, so 4*10 +9=49.

Yep, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, each of the next three decades (180s, 280s, 380s) is another 10 each, so 3*10=30, then 480-488 is 9. So total is 10 +30 +9=49. That seems correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: from 4,14,...484. Let's see, 484 is 484, so 484 is the 49th occurrence because 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in tens place, and there are 5 hundreds (0-9, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is part of the hundreds place, so for the tens place, it's 10 per hundred, so 5*10=50. That's correct. Hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. That's correct. For eights: units place: 8,18,...488. 488 is included, so (488-8)/10 +1=49. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So total 49. Hundreds place: none. So total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for eights.

    "text": " Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, then each hundred block adds another 10, so 4 times 10 is 40, plus the last set from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 +9=49. That's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 188 - 98 is 90. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each step again. Counting fours: units place from 4,14,...,484. How many terms? 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, but since we include 484, it's 49 numbers. So units:49. Tens place: 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each set is 10 numbers, and there are 5 sets (40-49 is in 0-99, then 140-149 in 100-199, etc., up to 440-449 in 400-499). So 5 sets \u00d710=50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So total fours:49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now, eights: units place from 8,18,...,488. How many terms? 488-8=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So units:49. Tens place:80-89,180-189, etc., up to 480-488. So 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So total eights:49+49=98. So 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. Is there a chance I overcounted the hundreds place for fours? Because 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, which is correct. And in the tens place, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. Similarly, for eights, the tens place up to 480-488 is correct. So I think the counts are accurate.

For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. 188-98=90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Wait, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right. Similarly, for the tens place of fours, 40-49, 140-149, etc., each block of 100 has 10 fours in the tens place, and we have 5 such blocks up to 400-499, but since we're only going up to 488, does that affect the count? Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. That seems correct. For the units place of fours, 4,14,...,484. 484 is 484, so (484 -4)/10 +1=48.4, but since we can't have a fraction, it's 49 numbers. So, 49 fours in units place. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For eights, units place: 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, so 480/10=48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.
