    "text": " Each of these ranges contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. The first range is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but the last range, 440-449, ends at 449, which is within 488. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 488 include 440-449? Yes, because 440-449 is before 488. So, 50 fours here. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 99 + 89 is actually 188. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? 488 - 8 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, but we need to add 1 because both ends are inclusive. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 488 is the 49th number because 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. Let me solve for n: 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place has 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are. The first is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). Wait, but does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that range. So, how many numbers in 480-488 have 8 in the tens place? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. Wait, but in the tens place, it's 8, so 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, contributing 10 eights each. The last range, 480-488, contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place has 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits with 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that seems off because 49+49=98, but let me check again. Units:49, Tens:49, so total 98 eights. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big difference. Let me recount the fours and eights.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1. So, (488-4)=484, 484/10=48.4, floor is 48, +1=49. So, 49.\n- Tens place: Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 440-449 is within 488. So, 50.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. How many? 488-400+1=89. So, 89.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor eights:\n- Units place:8,18,...,488. How many? (488-8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49.\n- Tens place:80-89 (10),180-189 (10),280-289 (10),380-389 (10),480-488 (9). So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49.\n- Hundreds place: none, as 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for eights. Let me check again. In the tens place, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4 full blocks (each contributing 10) and one partial block contributing 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is, for the tens place, how many times does 8 appear in the tens digit up to 488? Let's see: each hundred has a block where the tens digit is 8. So, from 0-99:80-89 (10), 100-199:180-189 (10), 200-299:280-289 (10), 300-399:380-389 (10), and 400-488:480-488 (9). So, that's 5 blocks, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for fours in the tens place, we have 5 blocks: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5*10=50.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine.\n\nSo, the total fours are 188, eights are 98, so the difference is 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot, but maybe that's correct.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately in each position and then sum them up.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488-400=88, plus 1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nAnd for the eights, since the hundreds digit never reaches 8 in 488, that's zero.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10.\n   - Number of terms = ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers.\n   - Total = 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms = 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10.\n   - Number of terms = ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total = 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total = 0.\n\n**Total 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. Starting from 40-49: that's one block, contributing 10 fours. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many blocks? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 here, so each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're counting whole numbers, it's 48 full tens, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let's see: 8,18,28,...,488. Yes, because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 8. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-489 is actually 480-488, since 489 is beyond 488. So, how many blocks? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, actually, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers, but each contributes an 8 in the tens place. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights in the tens place, and the last block (480-488) has 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 fours, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 such numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 eights each, and the last block contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449? Since the book goes up to 488, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's valid. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. Let's see, 400-488 is 89 numbers, but each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Wait, no. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, inclusive. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but we have to check if 488 is included. Yes, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 10 +10+10+10+9 = 49 eights. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10*4 +9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no hundreds digits of 8 in the page numbers. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98.

    "text": " Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. Let's see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. The number of such numbers is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place for numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. Wait, let me think: from 8 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then the 488 adds another one. So, 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place has 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that range. Let me count how many such ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, no, each range contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one which contributes 9. So, 4 full decades (80-89, etc.) give 4*10=40, and 480-488 gives 9, so total 40+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that can't be right because I think I might have made a mistake in counting the units place for 4's. Let me double-check that. When I was counting the units place for 4's, I thought of numbers like 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? The formula is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct. Similarly, for 8's in the units place: 8,18,...,488. (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So that's correct. For the tens place, 4's: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, 5 ranges, so 50. Correct. For 8's in the tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 ranges, but the last one has only 9 numbers. So, 4 ranges of 10 and 1 of 9, totaling 49. Correct. Hundreds place: 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. 8's: none. So, total 4's: 49+50+89=188. 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I thought the answer might be 90, but I'm not sure. Let me check another way. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position again to make sure. For 4's: units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 188. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. Difference: 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in page numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of such numbers: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 4's in units place: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges 400-488.\n   - Number of such numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in page numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of such numbers: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four ranges contribute 10 each, totaling 40.\n   - Last range (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. So, how many such ranges are there? From 0 to 488, we have 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each contributes 10 fours, so that's 5*10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place has 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

So, total eights in the tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9, which is 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights.

That's a total of 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.

So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

Wait, but in 400-488, the tens place for 440-449 is 4, but 450-488 would have 50-88 in the tens place, which doesn't include another 4 in the tens place. So, how many blocks?

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it.

So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total.

From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 = 9). So, for the tens place, we have 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9, totaling 4*10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no numbers in the hundreds place that have an 8.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 540-549 would be beyond 488, so we don't include that. So, how many ranges is that? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 488 is included. The tens place for 440-449 is up to 449, which is within 488, so yes, all 5 ranges are valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, 400-488 is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.

The first is 8, and the last is 488. Let's see how many numbers that is. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is valid, but 489 is beyond 488. So, let's count the ranges. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 eights, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 4*10 = 40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights printed: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89 (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four ranges contribute 10 each (4 \u00d7 10 = 40), and 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in 800-899, so 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 40-49, that's 1 block. Then 140-149 is another, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. Let me count: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, I need to do the same for the digit 8. Let's go through each digit position again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48, but since 488 is included, we need to check if 488 is the 49th occurrence. Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there? From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-489 would be the next block, but since the book only goes up to 488, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, for the tens place, we have 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 eights, and one partial block (480-488) contributing 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 in numbers from 800-899, but wait, the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's are printed than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers. The last number is 488, so dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, so 48 full groups of 10, each contributing an 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last number, so does that mean 488 is included? Yes, so the units place 8's are 8,18,...,488. Let's calculate how many: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let me count how many blocks. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, as 488 -480 +1=9). So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only if the number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many such numbers? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.

Wait, that's 49. Alternatively, another way: from 0 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except possibly the last one. The first four hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each have 10 eights in the tens place. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total is 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place contributes 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (from 4 to 484, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488.\n   - This range includes 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive).\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188 fours**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (from 8 to 488, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98 eights**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 fours - 98 eights = **90**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, and so on. How many blocks are there? The hundreds digit can be 0 (for 40-49), 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks (0,1,2,3,4). Each block contributes 10 fours, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. Let's calculate 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many numbers? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 8 is the first, and 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place has 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. The hundreds digit can be 0 (for 80-89), 1, 2, 3. Wait, 480-489 would be another block, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is part of that block. So, how many complete blocks are there? 0,1,2,3: that's 4 blocks. Each contributes 10 eights, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights. But wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488), so the tens place in 480-488 is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, instead of 10, it's 9. So, for the hundreds digit 4, the tens place 8 occurs only 9 times. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, but the last block (480-488) only contributes 9, so total is 40 - 1 = 39? Wait, no. Let me think again. The hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. But for 480-488, the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit is 8, but only up to 488. So, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? Let's list them: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So total eights in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought it's 4 blocks of 10, but actually, it's 5 blocks, but the last one is only 9. So, 4 full blocks (10 each) and one partial block with 9. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

The highest number is 488, so the last block is 440-449. So, how many blocks? 40-49: first block, 140-149: second, 240-249: third, 340-349: fourth, and 440-449: fifth. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, that's 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's do the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's the 49th multiple of 10. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. So, let's count the blocks: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total eights in the tens place: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 from the last partial block. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

So, each block contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 blocks. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. Wait, no, 400-488 is the range where the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.

Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. Total number of 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. Starting from 8, each set of 10 numbers contributes one 8 in the units place. The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me calculate how many numbers this is. The last number is 488, which is 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. The number of terms can be calculated as ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place has 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Now, let's see how many such ranges there are. 80-89: yes, 180-189: yes, 280-289: yes, 380-389: yes. But wait, 480-489 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but in the tens place, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place as well, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, not a full 10. So, the tens place for 8 in 480-488 would be 480-488, which is 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, how many full ranges do we have? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10. Then, 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total for the tens place: 4 ranges of 10, which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 40+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for each, so 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds places with 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding them up: Units place: 49, Tens place: 49, Hundreds place: 0. Total number of 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Okay, that's correct. For 8's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 49, so 98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Let me check again. When calculating the tens place for 4's, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. Now, for 8's in the tens place, I had 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 eights, and then 480-488 contributing 9 eights, so 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 groups, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. The hundreds place is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place for numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10 each time. To find how many terms, I can calculate (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the last group is 480-488. Let's check how many groups there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: let's see, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, in the tens place, each of the first four groups (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 eights, and the last group contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no hundreds digits with 8 in this book. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 4 appears in page numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - This is 49 occurrences (from 4 to 484, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 4 appears in page ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 4 appears in page ranges 400-488.  \n   - This is 89 occurrences (400 to 488 inclusive).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 8 appears in page numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - This is 49 occurrences (from 8 to 488, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 8 appears in page ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.  \n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 8 does not appear in any page number since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. Yes, 488 is the last page, so it's included. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, that's 49 numbers (since 488 is the 49th occurrence). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-489 would be 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488).

So, total eights in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds places with 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Wait, let me double-check: 400 is the first, 488 is the last.

So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8.

But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place for numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place has 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count these blocks. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4\u00d710=40 and 9, so total 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place contributes 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This is 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then, 140-149: another 10, and so on. The last block would be 440-449. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included because 449 is less than 488. So, how many blocks are there? Each block is 100 numbers apart. Starting at 40-49 (which is in the 40s), then 140-149 (140s), 240-249 (240s), 340-349 (340s), and 440-449 (440s). That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is only up to 449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, units place: 49 fours, tens place: 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book ends at 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it's 488, so the units digit is 8. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. To find how many, divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. So, starting from 8 (which is 8\u00d71), up to 488 (which is 8\u00d761). Wait, 8\u00d761 is 488. So, the number of terms is 61. Because 8\u00d71=8, 8\u00d72=16, but wait, that's not the right way. Wait, actually, the numbers are 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Each of these is 8 more than a multiple of 10. So, the number of terms can be found by (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-489 would only go up to 488. So, let's see how many blocks there are. Each block is 100 numbers apart, starting at 80-89 (80s), then 180-189 (180s), 280-289 (280s), 380-389 (380s), and 480-489 (480s). However, 480-489 would only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 9 numbers? Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the 480-489 block would have 9 numbers instead of 10. So, how many blocks? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10\u00d74 + 9 = 49. So, tens place contributes 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's recheck the number of 4's: units place: 49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. But let me think again about the tens place for 4's. I had 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. That's correct. For 8's in the tens place, I had 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last block only has 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks with 10 and 1 block with 9, totaling 49. That seems correct. Units place for both digits: 49 each, which makes sense because in each digit place, the number of times a digit appears is similar, except for the hundreds place where 4 appears more because the book goes up to 488. So, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Number of 4's:**\n   - **Units Place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 such numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Number of 8's:**\n   - **Units Place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks have 10 each, and the last has 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but 488 is included, right? So, yes, 488 is part of this range. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find the count, divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full decades. But since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: from 8 to 488, each 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place has 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. Let me count how many ranges there are.

So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights, subtract the total number of eights from the total number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

From 1-488, we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. So, for each hundred, the tens place has 10 fours. That's 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 fours. Then, in the 400s, the 440-449 block is part of the 401-488 range. So, that's another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct.

That's 9 numbers. So, in the 400s, the tens place contributes 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

    "text": " Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49 is one block, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, and since the book goes up to 488, 440-449 is within the range. So, yes, 5 blocks \u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10 each time. To find how many numbers, I can calculate ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1. That's (480 / 10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this.

So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9. So total tens place eights: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits with 8. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. That's correct. And for the tens place in fours, it's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Units place for fours: 4,14,...,484. Let's see, how many terms? The last term is 484, which is 400 + 84, so 484 = 400 + 84. Wait, but 484 is 484, so the units digit is 4, and the tens digit is 8. But in the units place, we're counting all numbers where the units digit is 4. So, from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 484 is the 49th term because 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. Solving for n: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 fours in units place. That's correct. For eights, in the tens place, the last block is 480-488. That's 9 numbers, so 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place for that block. So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, totaling 49. So, 49 eights in tens place. Units place for eights: 49 numbers, as calculated. So, 49 + 49 = 98 eights. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is indeed 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 4's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers.\n   - Total blocks: 5.\n   - Total 4's: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Numbers: 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each; the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total 8's: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages in 800-899, so 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is part of the three-digit numbers, but since our book goes up to 488, 440-449 is valid. So, how many sets? Each hundred has one set. So, 40-49 is the first hundred, 140-149 is the second, 240-249 is the third, 340-349 is the fourth, and 440-449 is the fifth. Each set contributes 10 fours. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, let me add up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place for numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. To find the count, we can do (488 - 8)/10 + 1. So, (488 - 8) is 480; 480/10 = 48; 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place has 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each set contributes 10 eights. Let's count how many such sets there are. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. Now, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, 480-489 would be another set, but wait, our book only goes up to 488. So, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, 8 can appear in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, the first four sets are complete, each contributing 10 eights, and the last set contributes 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

So, each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. There are 5 such blocks, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. So, from 8 to 488, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (4, 14, 24, ..., 484):** There are 49 numbers.\n2. **Tens place (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449):** Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks, totaling 50 numbers.\n3. **Hundreds place (400-488):** There are 89 numbers (from 400 to 488).\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place (8, 18, 28, ..., 488):** There are 49 numbers.\n2. **Tens place (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488):** Each block contributes 10 numbers, except the last block which contributes 9, totaling 49 numbers.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book only goes up to 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Since we go up to 488, the hundreds digits can be 0,1,2,3,4. Wait, but 0 is only for the first hundred (1-99), so the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49 (which is in 0-99), then 140-149 (100-199), 240-249 (200-299), 340-349 (300-399), and 440-449 (400-488). So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449: does 488 include all of 440-449? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. 2. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, 401, 402,...,488. So, yes, that's 89 numbers. So, adding up all the fours: units place 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. Total fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8 occurs once every 10 numbers starting from 8. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many ranges? From 80-89: that's one range, contributing 10 eights. Then 180-189: another 10. Similarly, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, the 8's occur in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9).

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. Total eights = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8. So, let's count each range: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 +10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9 (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). So total is 10*4 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights from units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No numbers in 1-488 have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, how many blocks? 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, and so on up to 440-449. So, 5 blocks times 10 numbers each gives 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 49 numbers because 488 is included. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block.

So, total eights in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, which is 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's.

    "text": " Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 440-449, right? Because 450-459 would be beyond 440-449, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is still within 488. So, how many ranges? Each hundred has one range: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is fully included. 440-449 is within 488, yes, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me check again. Wait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. But wait, from 400-488, that's correct. So, total fours are 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let me count each range: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, but let me check: from 0-99: 80-89 is 10. 100-199: 180-189 is 10. 200-299: 280-289 is 10. 300-399: 380-389 is 10. 400-488: 480-488 is 9. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours: units place: 4,14,24,...,484. That's from 4 to 484, which is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 5x10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For eights: units place: 8,18,28,...,488. From 8 to 488, which is (488-8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 ranges, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9, total 49. Correct. Hundreds place: none. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again: in the hundreds place for fours, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers, correct. For eights, in the hundreds place, it's 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. Therefore, the difference is 90.

Now, the last range is 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the numbers here are 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, that's 9 eights. So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, yes, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

Now, adding up the eights from each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

    "text": " Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. Starting from 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. How many blocks is that? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 count? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. 2. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? 400 to 488 is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Each block like 80-89 has 10 numbers, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Let me count the blocks: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, total eights in tens place: (4*10) + 9 = 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 40-49: that's one block. Then 140-149: another. 240-249: another. 340-349: another. 440-449: another. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. To find how many such numbers there are, I can divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, 8 x 1 = 8, 8 x 2 = 16, but wait, no, I'm just counting every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is calculated by ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, let's see how many full blocks there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10 numbers. 280-289: 10 numbers. 380-389: 10 numbers. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total eights in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one block of 9 (480-488). So, 4 x 10 = 40 and 9, so total 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, each block is 10 numbers, so 80-89 is 10 eights in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189 is another 10, and so on. But 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo find this, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places:\n\n**Counting Fours:**\n1. **Units Place:** 49 occurrences (4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens Place:** 50 occurrences (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n3. **Hundreds Place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n\nTotal fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting Eights:**\n1. **Units Place:** 49 occurrences (8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens Place:** 49 occurrences (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n3. **Hundreds Place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal eights = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. The blocks are: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, the last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. Each number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, hundreds place has 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. If I divide 488 by 10, I get 48.8. So, the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is 488, which is within the range. So, units place has 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens place has 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count each block:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488)\n\nSo, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no hundreds place eights. So, hundreds place has 0 eights.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. For 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's correct. So, total eights are 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me recount the fours and eights.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units: from 4,14,...,484. How many? Let's see: the last number is 484. So, 484 / 10 = 48.4, but since we start at 4, which is the first, the count is 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each with 10, so 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units: 8,18,...,488. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct.\n\n- Tens: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). Total 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as the book ends at 488 \u2192 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
