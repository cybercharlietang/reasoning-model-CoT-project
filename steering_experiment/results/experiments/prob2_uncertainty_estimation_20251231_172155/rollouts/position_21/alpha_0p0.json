    "text": " Let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-488, how many complete hundreds do we have? Well, 488 is less than 500, so we have four complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-500. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 401-488. So, let's see: - 40-49: 10 fours in the tens place - 140-149: 10 fours - 240-249: 10 fours - 340-349: 10 fours - 440-449: 10 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. But what about 480-488? The tens digit here is 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the tens place there. So, total tens place fours: 10 (from 40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449) = 50 fours. Wait, but let me double-check. Each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, so from 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is another 10. So total is 40 +10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 +50=99, 99+89=188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: starting from 8, the last number is 488. So, 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264488. So, 8 +10(n-1) \u2264488 \u219210(n-1) \u2264480 \u2192n-1 \u226448 \u2192n\u226449. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each block: -80-89:10 numbers, so 10 eights in the tens place. -180-189:10 eights. -280-289:10 eights. -380-389:10 eights. -480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8, and the units digit goes from 0 to 8, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, eights in the tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So total is 10*4 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights:0. Total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).

    "text": " Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, the last range is 400-488, but the tens digit is 4 only up to 449, right? Because 450-488 would have a tens digit of 5 or higher. So, actually, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only from 400-449. So, that's 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, no, because 400-449 is 50 numbers (from 400 to 449 inclusive), each contributing a 4 in the tens place. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, 480-488, which is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, let's break it down: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. - 180-189: 10 eights. - 280-289: 10 eights. - 380-389: 10 eights. - 480-488: 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 eights. So total eights in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{484}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.  \n   Each range contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).  \n   However, in the 400-488 range, only 400-449 have 4 in the tens place, contributing 50 occurrences.  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   5 \\times 10 = 50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 numbers.  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   89\n   \\]\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 50 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 89 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.  \n   Each range contributes 10 occurrences, except the last range (480-488), which contributes 9.  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   0\n   \\]\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 49 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 0 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**  \n\\[\n188 - 98 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on up to 440-449. How many sets is that? Let's see: 40-49 is the first set, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers. Then 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. That's 4 sets, each with 10 eights. So, 4 * 10 = 40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 in numbers from 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, there are 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, there are 89 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, I subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 89 eights = 99. So, there are 99 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49, that's one set, then 140-149, another, and so on. The last set would be 440-449. Let's see how many full sets there are. The hundreds digit can be 0 (for 40-49), 1 (140-149), 2 (240-249), 3 (340-349), and 4 (440-449). So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is okay, but does 440-449 end before 488? Yes, 449 is less than 488, so all 5 sets are complete. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, no, actually, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48 full tens, but let's check: 8, 18, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8. Each of these ranges (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except possibly the last one if it's cut short. Let's check: 80-89: 10 numbers, all within 488. 180-189: same. 280-289: same. 380-389: same. 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, for the tens place, we have 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 eights, and one partial set (480-488) contributing 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Wait, let me double-check that addition: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Yeah, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number with an 8 in the units place is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 numbers (from 8 to 488). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

So, in the tens place, we have 4 blocks contributing 10 eights each, and the last block contributing 9 eights. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights.

    "text": " Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 40-49 (which is the first block), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find the count, divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. 8, 18, ..., 488: The count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, contributing 4*10=40 eights. Now, the last block is 480-488, which has 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more fours than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Each of these ranges contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's see how many full ranges we have. From 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, which would give 48 eights, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's 8 in the units place. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes 10 eights. Let's count the ranges: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10. That's 4 ranges, so 4 * 10 = 40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, 89 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 89 eights = 99. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389. 4 ranges, each 10, so 40. Correct. Hundreds place: none. So total eights:49+40=89. So the difference is 188-89=99. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so when counting the tens place for 8's, does 380-389 go beyond 488? Wait, 380-389 is within 488, so that's fine. Similarly, 480-489 would be beyond, but we're only counting up to 488, so the last 8 in the tens place is at 488. Wait, but 488 is in the units place. Hmm, but in the tens place, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since the book ends at 488, how many 8's are there in the tens place from 480-488? Let me check. The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book only goes to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, in the tens place, 480-488 contributes 9 eights, not 10. Wait, so earlier I thought there were 4 ranges with 10 each, but the last range only has 9. So, I think I made a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. Let me correct that. The tens place for 8's occurs in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 4 full ranges of 10 and one partial range of 9. So total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 40. So, I need to recalculate. Let me clarify:\n\nWait, in the tens place, 8's occur in:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo that's 4 full ranges and one partial. So total in tens place: 4*10 +9=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4 ranges of 10, which would be 40, but actually, it's 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and then 480-488, which is 9. So total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought the tens place eights were 40, but now it's 49. That changes things.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the tens place eights were 40, but that's incorrect because I didn't consider that the last range only has 9 numbers. So, the correct count for tens place eights is 49.\n\nBut wait, that would mean the total eights are units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the units place eights are 49, and tens place eights are 49, so total eights would be 98. But earlier, I thought it was 89. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the initial calculation.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the units place. The units place eights are 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? From 8 to 488, step 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So units place eights:49.\n\nTens place eights: as above, 49.\n\nSo total eights:49+49=98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the tens place eights were 40, but that's wrong because I didn't account for the partial range at the end. So, the correct total eights are 98.\n\nWait, but that would mean the number of fours is 188, and eights are 98, so the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because earlier I thought the tens place eights were 40, but now it's 49. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, in the tens place, 8's occur in:\n\n- 80-89:10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo that's 4 full ranges (each 10) and one partial range (9). So total tens place eights:4*10 +9=49.\n\nSo, units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0. Total eights:98.\n\nSo, fours:188, eights:98. Difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 99, but now it's 90. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial calculation of the tens place eights. Let me confirm again.\n\nWait, the tens place eights are in 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges is 10 numbers, and the last is 9 numbers. So 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place eights:49.\n\nUnits place eights:49.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nFours:188.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 99. So, where did I go wrong? Let me check the fours again.\n\nFours in units place:49.\n\nFours in tens place:50.\n\nFours in hundreds place:89.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nEights: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0. Total:98.\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the tens place eights. Because in the tens place, 8's occur in 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 ranges, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the initial calculation, I thought the tens place eights were 40, but that's wrong because I didn't consider the partial range. So, the correct total eights are 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer was 99 earlier. Let me check again.\n\nWait, let me recount the eights:\n\nUnits place:8,18,28,...,488. Number of terms: (488-8)/10 +1=48+1=49.\n\nTens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. Total:49.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nFours:188.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 99, but I must have made a mistake in counting the tens place eights as 40 instead of 49. So, the correct answer is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the number of eights in the tens place differently.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nFor each hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n\nSo, for 1-99: 10 times.\n\nFor 100-199:10 times.\n\nFor 200-299:10 times.\n\nFor 300-399:10 times.\n\nFor 400-488: how many times? The tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total tens place eights:4*10 +9=49.\n\nSo, units place eights:49, tens place eights:49, total eights:98.\n\nFours:188.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I initially thought it was 99, but now it's 90. Let me check another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of eights in each digit place:\n\nUnits place: For every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, total units eights: floor(488/10)=48 full tens, and then check if the last partial ten includes 8. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, and the last partial ten is 480-488, which includes 488, which has 8 in the units place. So, units eights:48 +1=49.\n\nTens place: For every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89). So, how many hundreds are there? 488/100=4.88, so 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 eights in the tens place:4*10=40. Now, the remaining 88 numbers (401-488) have the tens digit as 0-8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, tens place eights:40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 8 appears in the hundreds place only in 800-899, which is beyond 488, so 0.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nFours:188.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, so the correct answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. Each number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Let's count how many times 8 appears in each digit position. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is included. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488 with step 10: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these contributes 10 eights, except the last one, which is only 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive).

So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. Wait, let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Each 10 numbers contribute one 8 in the units place. So, from 0 to 488, how many tens? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is the last page, that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-489, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the hundreds place 4, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, how many full ranges? 0-399: 4 ranges, each with 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 400-488, it's 9 eights in the tens place. So total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (from 4 to 484, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - Total occurrences: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (from 8 to 488, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, totaling 40.\n   - The last range (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such blocks exist up to 488. - 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 fours. Now, let's add up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let me go through each digit position again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence in the units place is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is valid. So, each block from 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. Let's count how many full blocks and partial blocks: - 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, the first four blocks contribute 4 x 10 = 40 eights, and the last block contributes 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, checking each digit place: 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but let's check: 8, 18, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. Let's count how many such ranges fit into 488. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-489: but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488 only 9 times, not 10. So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, plus the partial range 480-488 contributing 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 98 eights.

    "text": " Let me count how many such sets there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, each hundred has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many hundreds are there up to 488? Let's see: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, there are 5 sets where the tens digit is 4. Each set contributes 10 numbers, so that's 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but the last set is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such sets there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers. Then each hundred has a set of 10 where the tens digit is 8. How many hundreds? Up to 488, we have 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, 5 sets. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 eights in the tens place. However, wait: the last set is 480-489, but our book ends at 488. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, instead of 10, it's 9. Therefore, the tens place eights are: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and 1 set of 9 (480-488). So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

Wait, in each of the first four blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), there's a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So that's 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40.

Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers.

Now, in the last block, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the last block, it's 9 eights in the tens place. So total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488.

Now, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Well, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the page numbers. So, 480-488 has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, for 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (from 0-399) plus 9 in 400-488. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights are printed. So, fours are 188, eights are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours and eights again. For fours: units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place:89. Total: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0. Total:98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. The first is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, the last range is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, 401, 402, ..., up to 488. Yes, that's 89 numbers. So, hundreds place has 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but we have to check if 488 is included. Since 488 is the last page, it's included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range has 10 numbers. Let's see how many such ranges are within 488. The first is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189 (another 10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). The next would be 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, I'm a bit confused because when I calculated the tens place for fours, I had 5 ranges (40-49, 140-149, etc.) up to 440-449, which is 5*10=50. That seems right. For eights, in the tens place, I had 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each with 10, and then 480-488 with 9, totaling 49. That seems correct. So, the difference is 90.

    "text": " Let's count how many numbers that is. Each set of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-400, that's 4 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, from 440-449, that's another 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's are 40 +10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. Let's see how many numbers that is. 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18,..., 488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 numbers. Let's see how many such sets exist within 488. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. Now, 480-489 would be another set, but since the book only goes up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, for the tens place, we have 10+10+10+9=39 eights. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89: 10. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. Then, 480-488:9. So total 10+10+10+9=39. So, 39 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: 49 (units) +39 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =88 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours -88 eights=100.

So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98.

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place, plus the last number 488, which has an 8 in the units place. Wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one.

Let's count how many such ranges exist: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the hundreds place 4, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many ranges? The first four ranges (80-89, etc.) each have 10, and the last one has 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts because 90 seems like a big difference. Let me recount the fours and eights to make sure I didn't make a mistake. **Recounting Fours:**\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. How many numbers?

This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This is 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488.

    "text": " Let's count how many such sets there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449 each add 10 numbers. How many sets are there? From 0-400, there are 5 sets (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-499). But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set (440-449) is complete, but 450-488 doesn't include another full set. Wait, actually, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place. There are 5 sets, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's indeed 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's count how many. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. Wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me count how many sets. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is another 10. Similarly, 280-289 and 380-389 each add 10. Now, 480-489 would be another set, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of the last set. So, how many sets do we have? From 0-399, we have 4 sets: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens place is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, the tens place has 40 +9=49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 4 sets \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, let me add up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers. The last one is 488, which is 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, adding up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. So, total eights are 49+49=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me make sure I didn't overcount. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, which is correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? Let me check: 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. Starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, each of the first four ranges has 10, and the last has 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.

So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9.

So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have a 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? Let's subtract 400 from 488 and add 1 (since both ends are inclusive). 488 - 400 = 88, so 88 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.

Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48.

Then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 4 ranges \u00d7 10 numbers = 40 eights in the tens place. Wait, does 480-489 count? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, but the tens digit is 8. Let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, right? So, 480-488 has 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place. But earlier, I considered ranges like 80-89, which have 10 numbers. So, for the tens place, I have 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, did I make a mistake earlier? I think so. Initially, I thought it was 4 ranges \u00d710, but actually, there's an additional partial range at 480-488. So, the correct count is 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 eights, and the 480-488 range contributing 9 eights. So, 4\u00d710=40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have an 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus the last partial set, which is 484, so that's 49. So units place: 49. Tens place: as above, 50. Hundreds place: 89. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus the last number 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So units place: 49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range has 10 numbers. From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-489, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. Wait, so in the hundreds place 4, the tens place 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, how many ranges have 10 numbers? The first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 numbers. The last one, 480-488, has 9. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me check again because I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. Specifically, in the tens place, for 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, in the tens place, it's 4 full ranges (each 10 numbers) plus 9, totaling 49. So, yes, 49 in tens place. Units place: 49. Hundreds: 0. So total 8's: 98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90 more fours. Wait, but earlier when I thought about the hundreds place for 4's, I had 89 fours. Let me check that again. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So that's correct. So, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188. 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. So 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in numbers 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (since 484 is the 49th number in this sequence).\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in numbers 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, for each hundred, there's one block of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-488, how many hundreds do we have? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. Wait, but the 4 in the tens place can also occur in 400-488. Let me think again. The tens digit cycles every 100, so in each 100 numbers, there's a block where the tens digit is 4. So, in 1-100, it's 40-49 (10 numbers). In 101-200, it's 140-149 (10 numbers). Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Now, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many blocks? 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is only up to 449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " Let's count how many numbers that is. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-488, how many hundreds do we have? Well, 488 is less than 500, so we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. Wait, but the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, meaning 48 occurrences, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488 is the 49th number. Wait, no: 8 is the 1st, 18 the 2nd, ..., 488 would be the (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count these. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (including both ends). So, for the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) gives 40, and then 480-488 is 9, so total 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check the tens place for eights again. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. And units place: 49. So, 98 total eights. Fours: 188. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours.

    "text": " Each of these decades contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's count how many such decades there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers) From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers) From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers) From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 decades, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488, which is the units place. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but including 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these decades contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's see: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers) From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers) From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers) From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the hundreds place, 480-488 gives 9 eights in the tens place, not 10. So, the tens place eights are: 4 decades with 10 each (40-49, etc.) and 1 decade with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, no, let me correct that. Wait, actually, in the 400-488 range, the tens place 8 occurs in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488, so 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens place eights are: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, total is 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights are units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that can't be right because in the hundreds place, 8 doesn't appear, so total eights would be 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 0-99: 80-89 (10) From 100-199: 180-189 (10) From 200-299: 280-289 (10) From 300-399: 380-389 (10) From 400-488: 480-488 (9). So, yes, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Now, the fours were 188 and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the fours or eights. Let me recount the fours. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The formula is (last - first)/step +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now for eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four contributes 10, and the last contributes 9, so 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range. Let me count how many such sets there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it starts at 8. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place has 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count how many sets there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. So, that's 4 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is within range, but 480-489 would be next, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of the tens place. Wait, no, the tens digit in 480-488 is 8, right? Because 480 is 4 8 0, 481 is 4 8 1, up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive). So, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount the tens place for 8. The sets are: 80-89: 10 eights. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. And then 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Hmm, I think that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since our book only goes up to 488, it's 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does that mean 488 is included? Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, starting at 8 and adding 10 each time. The number of terms can be calculated as ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289:10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights are printed. So, fours are 188, eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check my calculations again because 188-98=90 seems correct, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit again for both fours and eights. For fours: units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for fours. I had 5 ranges: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours in the tens place. That seems correct. For eights, in the tens place, I had 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, that's 5 ranges, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 4 ranges with 10 each, and one with 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, that's correct. Units place for fours: 49, correct. For eights, units place: 49, correct. So, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights, so 90 more fours. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-499, there are 5 ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-499). But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 440-449 and then 450-488, where 450-488 doesn't have a full set of 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Wait, no, 440-449 is the last full range with 4 in the tens place before 450. So, how many full ranges do we have? Let me think. The first range is 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: 10. 340-349: 10. 440-449: 10. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, it's fully included. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. To find the count: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place with 8. Let's count each range: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total eights in the tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4x10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the Number of 4's:**\n1. **Units Place (4, 14, 24, ..., 484):**\n   - There are 49 occurrences (from 4 to 484, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens Place (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449):**\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges, totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place (400-488):**\n   - There are 89 numbers from 400 to 488, each with a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the Number of 8's:**\n1. **Units Place (8, 18, 28, ..., 488):**\n   - There are 49 occurrences (from 8 to 488, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens Place (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488):**\n   - Four full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 40, and the partial range 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:** \n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 more. So, total is 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, each contributing one 4. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block of 100 contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks, so 4*10=40. Now, from 400-488, does the tens digit ever reach 8? The next would be 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.

So, 4x10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

So, yes, that's 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me double-check. The hundreds digit is 4 in 400-499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 400-488. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me recalculate. 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99. 99 + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Hmm, but wait, when I'm counting the hundreds place, I'm including numbers where the hundreds digit is 4, which is correct. But let me make sure I didn't double-count any numbers where both tens and units have 4, like 444. No, because I'm counting each digit separately, so each occurrence is counted once. So, 188 fours in total. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, meaning 48 numbers, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, 8, 18, ..., 488. How many terms? Let me calculate: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (including both ends). So, how many blocks? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 480-488 is correct. 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 eights in the tens place for that block. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98 eights. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I feel like I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let's recalculate the fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.

Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with an 8. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find the count, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 49 numbers (since 8 is the 1st, 18 the 2nd, ..., 488 the 49th). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's check each range. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers).

Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the 9th number in this range (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the hundreds place, for 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many ranges have 10 numbers? The first four ranges (0-399) each contribute 10 eights in the tens place. The last range (400-488) contributes 9 eights.

    "text": " Each of these ranges contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49: that's one set. Then 140-149, another set. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets in total. Each set contributes 10 fours, so 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which would give 48 eights. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges we have. 80-89: yes, 180-189: yes, 280-289: yes, 380-389: yes. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4\u00d710=40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 89 (eights) = 99. So, there are 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 40.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 40 = 89.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 89 (8's) = 99.\n\n\\boxed{99}"

That's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 89. So, total eights are 89. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 89 (eights) = 99. Wait, that's 99 more fours than eights. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 40, hundreds 0. Total 89. Difference is 188 - 89 = 99.

Then 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.

The next would be 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488. That's 9 numbers, not 10. So, in the tens place, we have 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9.
