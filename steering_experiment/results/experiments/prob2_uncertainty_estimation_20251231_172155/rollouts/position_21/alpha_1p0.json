    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds place can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, let's see. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 exactly 10 times (e.g., 40-49). So, for hundreds 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? Wait, actually, page numbers start at 1, so the first hundred is 1-100, then 101-200, etc. Wait, no, actually, page 1 is 1, page 100 is 100, page 200 is 200, etc. So, in the tens place, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times. So, from 1-100: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 101-200: 140-149 is 10 numbers. Similarly, 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but page 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, total 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me add that again: 49 +50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. Wait, because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. Wait, let's see: For each hundred, the tens digit is 8 in 10 numbers. So, from 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 180-189 (10). From 201-300: 280-289 (10). From 301-400: 380-389 (10). From 401-488: 480-488. So, that's 5 sets, but the last set is only 9 numbers because 489 is beyond 488. So, for the first four hundreds, each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, and the last hundred contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but let me think again. From 0-99: 80-89 (10). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299:280-289 (10). 300-399:380-389 (10). 400-488:480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, so total 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each hundred contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This gives 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. Each hundred contributes 10, except the last which contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n   \nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me see how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so that's 10 per hundred. Since the book goes up to 488, which is less than 500, we have 4 full hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is not a full hundred. So, in each full hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each. So that's 3 hundreds * 10 = 30. Now, in the 400-488 range, how many numbers have 4 in the tens place? From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, 410-419, ..., up to 480-488. Wait, no, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, which is 10 numbers, and then 410-419 is tens digit 1, so actually, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 400-409, which is 10 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-409) = 40 fours. Wait, but 400-488 includes 400-409, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 10 more. So, 30 + 10 = 40. So, 40 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, total number of fours is units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89; 89 + 89 = 178. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484: that's 484 /10 = 48.4, but since 484 is included, it's 49 numbers. Tens place: 10 per hundred for 3 full hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) = 30. Then in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, which is 10 numbers. So total 40. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 49 + 40 + 89 = 178 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. The last number is 488. So, how many? 488 /10 = 48.8, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 numbers - 280-289: 10 numbers - 380-389: 10 numbers - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last, but 480-489 would be 10, but we only go up to 488, so 9). So, total in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. Wait, 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10*4=40 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49 +49=98. Now, the number of fours is 178, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 178 -98=80. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 40, hundreds 89. 49+40=89, 89+89=178. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 178-98=80. So, there are 80 more fours than eights. But wait, let me check the tens place for fours again. I thought in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only from 400-409, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours in the tens place in that range. But 400-409 is 10 numbers, so that's correct. And in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place: 49 fours. So, 49+40+89=178. For eights, units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds:0, so 98. 178-98=80. So, the answer should be 80 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 400-409. There are 40 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 40 + 89 = 178.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

There are 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 178 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 80.\n\n$\\boxed{80}$"

    "text": " Let's see. For each hundred, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 1-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Hmm, but wait, does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll go through each digit position. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: Here, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 numbers instead of 10. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let me check how many times 4 appears in the tens place. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 exactly 10 times (e.g., 40-49). How many hundreds do we have? From 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, 400-488 is only 88 pages, so the tens digit in 400-488 would be 0-8, but 400-409 is part of it. So, for the tens digit, let's see:\n\n- 1-99: 10 times (40-49)\n- 100-199: 10 times (140-149)\n- 200-299: 10 times (240-249)\n- 300-399: 10 times (340-349)\n- 400-488: Here, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 400-409 is 10 numbers, but 410-488 would have tens digits from 1 to 8. So, does the tens digit 4 appear again? Yes, 440-449. So, that's another 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, right? So, that's another 10 fours in the tens place. So, total tens place fours would be 10 (1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 50 fours. Wait, but 400-488 is up to 488, so does 440-449 fall within that? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 10 fours in the tens place here. So, total tens place fours: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in pages 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me check if I did that correctly. Wait, units place: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Okay, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range. Let's count each hundred:\n\n- 1-99: 80-89: 10 eights\n- 100-199: 180-189: 10 eights\n- 200-299: 280-289: 10 eights\n- 300-399: 380-389: 10 eights\n- 400-488: 480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8, but how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 eights in the tens place here.\n\nSo, total tens place eights: 10 (1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 49 eights. Wait, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place eights: 0. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 188\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so in the hundreds place, the maximum is 4, so 400-488. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's break it down: - From 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. So, 10 fours. - From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10 fours. - From 200-299: 240-249 is another 10 fours. - From 300-399: 340-349 is another 10 fours. - From 400-488: 440-449 is another 10 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 fours. So, total in tens place is 10 (from 0-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-449). That's 50 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is only up to 449, but the book goes up to 488, so does that affect the count? No, because we're only considering the tens place. So, 10 fours in each hundred, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). But wait, 400-488 is a partial hundred, but since we're only looking at the tens place, 440-449 is still 10 numbers. So, 5 times 10 is 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many such numbers are there? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. To find how many terms, we can use the formula: number of terms = ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each: - From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. So, 10 eights. - From 100-199: 180-189 is another 10 eights. - From 200-299: 280-289 is another 10 eights. - From 300-399: 380-389 is another 10 eights. - From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only from page 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, did I do that right? Let me double-check the counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. Yes. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's it.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Number of '4's:**\n   - **Units Place (Ones Place):** '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** '4' appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each hundred has 10 such numbers, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). This gives 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** '4' appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Number of '8's:**\n   - **Units Place:** '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** '8' appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each hundred has 10 such numbers, except the last range (480-488) which has 9 numbers. This gives 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no '8's in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the number of '8's from the number of '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are \\boxed{90} more '4's printed than '8's."

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds place is 4 only up to 488. Let me think. For the tens place, the 4's occur in 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me check how many times that is. The first 8 is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the Number of 4's:**\n1. **Units Place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Each set contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**.\n\n**Counting the Number of 8's:**\n1. **Units Place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " Wait, does 488 go beyond 480? Yes, 488 is the last page. So, let me list the ranges where 4 is in the tens place. - 40-49: 10 numbers. - 140-149: 10 numbers. - 240-249: 10 numbers. - 340-349: 10 numbers. - 440-449: 10 numbers. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, each of these ranges contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49 up to 440-449, that's 5 ranges. So, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, is 440-449 within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place is where the number is 100 or more. The hundreds digit can be 4 in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me check if I did that right. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. Adding them up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms can be calculated as ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. Let me check each range:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers.\n- 180-189: 10 numbers.\n- 280-289: 10 numbers.\n- 380-389: 10 numbers.\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers).\n\nWait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10, because 488 is the last page. So, for the tens place, each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 10 eights each, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 10 eights. Similarly, 180-189 is another 10. 280-289 another 10. 380-389 another 10. Now, 480-488 is from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, each of these contributes 10 except the last one, which contributes 9. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0. So, 49 + 49 is 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 is 90, but I'm not sure if I counted correctly. Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, counting the fours:\n\n- Units place: 49 fours. Correct because from 4, 14, ..., 484, which is 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49.\n- Tens place: 5 ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 fours, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, counting the eights:\n\n- Units place: 49 eights. Correct because from 8, 18, ..., 488, which is 488 - 8 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49.\n- Tens place: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one range of 9 (480-488). So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct because the book doesn't reach 800.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Yes, correct. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd for the tens place, in the hundreds, 440-449 is included, which is correct because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 10 fours in the tens place there.\n\nFor the eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 (from four ranges of 10) + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference between their counts.\n\n**Counting the number of '4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** \n   - Pages: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total '4's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Pages: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 '4's.\n   - Number of ranges: 5.\n   - Total '4's: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages: 400-488.\n   - Number of pages: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total '4's: 89.\n\n**Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of '8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Pages: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total '8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Pages: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Ranges with 10 '8's: 4 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).\n   - Range with 9 '8's: 480-488.\n   - Total '8's: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages: None, as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total '8's: 0.\n\n**Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\nNumber of '4's - Number of '8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9, so in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 exactly 10 times. So, for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, how many hundreds do we have? From 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, 1-99 is two-digit numbers, so in 1-99, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, in 100-199, the tens digit is 4 for 140-149, which is another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10 numbers. 300-399: 340-349, 10 numbers. And 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers because 449 is within 488. So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, total in tens place: 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. So, let's count each: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

    "text": " Wait, up to 488, so the hundreds place can go up to 4. Let me think. For the tens place, each hundred has a set of numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99, it's 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, from 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. From 200-299, 240-249, 10 more. From 300-399, 340-349, another 10. From 400-488, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10. So, total for the tens place: 10 (0-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 50 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 488 is beyond that, so maybe that's okay. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's.

So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 80-89 is in 0-99, 180-189 in 100-199, 280-289 in 200-299, 380-389 in 300-399, and then 480-488 in 400-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, for the tens place, each hundred has 10 numbers except the last one. So, 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189: 10. 200-299: 280-289: 10. 300-399: 380-389: 10. 400-488: 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the number of 4's and 8's. For 4's: Units place: 4,14,...,484: that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449: each hundred contributes 10, and there are 5 hundreds (0-400), but wait, 400-488 is the fifth hundred, but from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488: same as 4's, 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,...,480-488: as before, 49 numbers. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each hundred contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. This contributes 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. This contributes 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds place can only go up to 4. So, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see: From 1 to 99, the tens place has 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, from 100-199, the tens place has 4 in 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for the hundreds place, 4 appears in pages 400-488. How many times does 4 appear here? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in each of these, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but does the hundreds digit only start at 400? Yes, so 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's count how many times. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights =90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, did I count correctly? Let me double-check. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yes, that seems correct.

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds place can go up to 4. Let me think. For the tens digit, it cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). How many hundreds are there? From 1 to 488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. That's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? The difference is 488 - 8 = 480, and since we're counting every 10 numbers, that's 480 / 10 = 48. But we need to add 1 because both endpoints are included. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. But since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89). There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the 400-488 range, does the tens digit 8 appear? Yes, in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 eights in the tens place here. So, total tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. Correct. For the 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. Correct. So, 188 - 98 = 90.

From 101-200: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, and 340-349: 10. Now, 400-488: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10. So, total for tens place: 10 (from 1-100) + 10 (101-200) + 10 (201-300) + 10 (301-400) + 10 (401-488). Wait, but 401-488: the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers.

So yes, 5 sets, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.

So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers, right? Because from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place, so 49 times. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count each hundred: - 1-100: 80-89: 10 numbers. - 101-200: 180-189: 10. - 201-300: 280-289: 10. - 301-400: 380-389: 10. - 401-488: 480-488: how many? 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers because from 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers (480 is the first, 488 is the last, so 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, for the tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so that's 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488.

So, total fours in tens place: 30 + 10 = 40. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours. Wait, no, that's not correct. The hundreds digit is 4 for each number from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, but each of these contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89; 89 + 89 = 178. So, total fours: 178. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the hundreds digit 4. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. For each hundred, the tens digit is 8 in 10 numbers. So, for hundreds 1, 2, 3, each contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, 3*10=30. Then, for hundreds 4, which is 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for hundreds 4. So, total eights in tens place: 30 + 9 = 39. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (39) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 39 = 88. So, total eights: 88. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 178 fours - 88 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484. This gives 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). For the first three hundreds (100-399), this is 3 \u00d7 10 = 30. In the 400-488 range, it appears 10 times (440-449). Total: 40.\n3. **Hundreds place:** From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **178**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8 to 488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). For the first three hundreds, this is 3 \u00d7 10 = 30. In the 400-488 range, it appears 9 times (480-488). Total: 39.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 39 (tens) = **88**.\n\n**Difference:** 178 (4's) - 88 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds place can only be up to 4. So, the hundreds place for 4's would be 400-488. But when considering the tens place, it's every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, from 1 to 488, how many hundreds are there? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. Wait, no, actually, 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds go up to 4. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 fours in the tens place. But wait, does the last hundred (401-488) have a full set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4? Let's see: 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's a full 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours are 4*10=40. Hmm, but wait, is that correct? Let me think again. From 1-100: 40-49 (10 fours). From 101-200: 140-149 (10 fours). From 201-300: 240-249 (10 fours). From 301-400: 340-349 (10 fours). From 401-488: 440-449 (10 fours). So, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Since 488 is beyond 400, the 400-488 range includes another set of 440-449, so that's 5 sets, making it 50 fours in the tens place. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours from units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but including 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, 488 is the 49th number because 8,18,...,488 is every 10 numbers starting at 8. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last). So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place contributes 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights from units and tens places: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 484 / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10, and there are 5 such sets.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, for each hundred, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99, 40-49: 10 numbers. From 100-199, 140-149: 10 numbers. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249: 10 numbers. 300-399: 340-349: 10 numbers. Now, 400-488: 440-449: 10 numbers, but wait, 488 is the last page. So, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers.

That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me check: 400, 401, ..., 488. Yes, that's 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds place again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many sets of 100 have 8 in the tens place. From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189: 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289: 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389: 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, that's 9 numbers because 488-480=8, so 9 numbers including both ends. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 0-399) and 1 set of 9 (from 400-488). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

Let me check each hundred: - 1-99: 40-49 has 10 fours in the tens place. - 100-199: 140-149 has another 10. - 200-299: 240-249, another 10. - 300-399: 340-349, another 10. - 400-488: 440-449 has 10, but wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, 449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 fours. So total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? Let's see: The first is 8, the last is 488. The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms can be calculated by (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each: - 1-99: 80-89, 10 numbers. - 100-199: 180-189, 10 numbers. - 200-299: 280-289, 10 numbers. - 300-399: 380-389, 10 numbers. - 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, adding up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Similarly, 200-299: 240-249 (10), 300-399: 340-349 (10), and 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total in tens place: 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50.

How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89.

    "text": " Wait, up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449. Let me calculate how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). From 1-400, that's 4 blocks of 100, so 4*10=40 fours. Then, from 401-488, the tens place can be 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in page numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last occurrence is at 488, which is the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we include 488, it's 49 occurrences. Wait, let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see: from 1-488, how many blocks of 100 have 80-89? There are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the next block would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, that's 9 eights. So total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in page numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights. I think that's the answer. Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. That seems correct. For eights, in the tens place, from 401-488, I thought it was 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 eights in the tens place in that range. So, 40 (from 1-400) + 9 = 49. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Yes, that's correct. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (from 4 to 484, inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block of 100 contributes 10 occurrences, so 4 blocks (1-400) give 40.\n   - From 401-488, 440-449 adds another 10.\n   - Total: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (from 8 to 488, inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389.\n   - Each block of 100 contributes 10 occurrences, so 4 blocks (1-400) give 40.\n   - From 401-488, 480-488 adds 9.\n   - Total: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, up to 488, so the hundreds place can go up to 4. Let me check each hundred. - In 1-99: 40-49, that's 10 numbers. So, 10 fours in the tens place. - In 100-199: 140-149, another 10 fours. - In 200-299: 240-249, another 10 fours. - In 300-399: 340-349, another 10 fours. - In 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 fours. So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? Let me confirm: 488 - 400 = 88, so 88 + 1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is included. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let's check each hundred. - In 1-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. So, 10 eights in the tens place. - In 100-199: 180-189, another 10 eights. - In 200-299: 280-289, another 10 eights. - In 300-399: 380-389, another 10 eights. - In 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place of 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, for 400-488, it's 9 eights instead of 10. So, adding up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. Difference is 90. Hmm, seems right. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. For the tens place in 4's, 10 in each hundred up to 400-488, which is 5 hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 10 in each hundred, but 400-488 is not a full hundred, but in the tens place, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, yes, 50 in the tens place. Similarly, for 8's, in the tens place, in 400-488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 49 in the tens place. Units place is 49 for both. So, yeah, the calculations seem correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488 \u2192 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 count as a full block? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in each of these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's.

So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 count? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many blocks of 100 have 8 in the tens place? From 1-400, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, in the tens place, we have 40 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

    "text": " Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds place can only go up to 4. So, the hundreds place for 4 is from 400-488. Let me think. For the tens place, the 4 can be in the tens digit regardless of the hundreds digit. So, for each hundred, there's a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers).

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, that's 89 fours.

Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so 8, 18, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can be in the tens digit. So, from 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last one. So, 480, 481, ..., 488: that's 9 numbers.

But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let's count: From 1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers). So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800-899, but our book goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99; 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that's correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each hundred contributes 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This totals 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds place goes up to 4. Let me see. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds do we have? We have 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, four sets. Each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40 fours. But wait, 400-488 is only 88 numbers, but the tens digit still cycles through 0-9 for each hundred. So, 400-488 includes the tens digits 0-8, but does it include 4? Yes, 400-409, 410-419, etc., up to 480-488. Wait, but 400-488 includes the tens digit 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds, 10 each, so 40 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 40 + 89 = 178 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, 480-488, which only has 9 numbers (480-488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so 9 eights. Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all, so 9 eights in the tens place for that range. So, let's break it down: - 80-89: 10 eights - 180-189: 10 eights - 280-289: 10 eights - 380-389: 10 eights - 480-488: 9 eights So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, but let me confirm: from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers. So, for 1-99: 80-89: 10 eights. 100-199: 180-189: 10 eights. 200-299: 280-289: 10 eights. 300-399: 380-389: 10 eights. 400-488: 480-488: 9 eights. So, total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 178 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 80.

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last number with a 4 in the tens place is 484, but actually, 484 is a three-digit number where the tens digit is 8, not 4. Wait, no, 484 is 4 in the hundreds place, 8 in the tens, and 4 in the units. So, for the tens place, the numbers would be 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count each set: Each set has 10 numbers, so 10 per hundred. From 1-400, how many hundreds? 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). So, in each hundred, there's one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, 40 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89, plus 89 is 178. Wait, 49 + 40 is 89, plus 89 is 178. So, 178 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's the 48th multiple plus 8. Wait, 8 \u00d7 61 = 488, so 61 times? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's the number of complete groups of 10, which is 488 // 10 = 48, plus if the remainder is >=8, we add 1. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, which is exactly 8, so we add 1. So, 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these sets contributes 10 numbers, except possibly the last one if it's cut short. Let's see: From 1-488, how many sets of 100 are there? 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). In each hundred, the tens digit is 8 in one set: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, instead of 10, we have 9. So, total tens place eights: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait: 400-488 includes 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, yes, 9. So, 40 from the first four hundreds, plus 9 in the last partial hundred, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's are 178, total 8's are 98. The difference is 178 - 98 = 80. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 40, hundreds 89. 49+40=89, plus 89 is 178. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 178-98=80. Hmm, but wait, earlier I thought the tens place for 8's was 49, but let me recount that. In the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 eights, except the last one which contributes 9. So, 4 hundreds \u00d710 =40, plus 9, total 49. That seems correct. Units place: 49, correct. Hundreds place: 0, correct. So, 98 eights. 178 fours. 178-98=80. So, the answer should be 80 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, correct. Units place for fours: from 4,14,...,484. 484 is the 49th occurrence. Correct. Tens place for fours: 40-49,140-149, etc., each 10 numbers, 4 sets, so 40. Correct. So, 49+40+89=178 fours. For eights, units: 49, tens:49, hundreds:0, total 98. So, difference is 80. So, the answer is 80 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   Total occurrences: 49 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   Each set contributes 10 numbers, and there are 4 such sets (1-400).  \n   Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears from page 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).  \n   Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **178**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   Total occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   Each set contributes 10 numbers, and there are 4 such sets (1-400).  \n   The last set (480-488) contributes 9 numbers.  \n   Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 178 - 98 = **80**.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{80}"

    "text": " Let me check up to 488. So, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. For hundreds digit 0 (pages 1-99), the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. For hundreds digit 1 (100-199), the tens digit 4 is in 140-149, another 10 numbers. Similarly, for 200-299, it's 240-249 (10 numbers). For 300-399, 340-349 (10 numbers). For 400-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 400-488. So, that's 10 numbers. So, in total, how many? 10 (for 40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449) = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 only in pages 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? Let's divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. So, 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me check: 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 = 8 + (49-1)*10 = 8 + 480 = 488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, since the book ends at 488, does 480-489 exist? 480-488 is within the book, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8 in the tens digit. So, let's count: - 80-89: 10 numbers (80-89) - 180-189: 10 numbers - 280-289: 10 numbers - 380-389: 10 numbers - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no hundreds digits of 8 in the page numbers. So, hundreds place eights: 0. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units place 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds place can't go beyond 4. Let me think. For the tens place, the 4 can be in 04-09 (but since page 1 is 1, the first 4 in the tens place is 40). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. But 440-449 is within 488, right? So, from 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 include page 449, which is less than 488? Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. How many such numbers? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first is 8, the last is 488. To find how many terms, we can calculate (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many sets of 10 there are. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers, since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, for the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each has 10 numbers, so 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above. But the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, did I do that right? Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I missed anything. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This is 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488.

    "text": " Wait, the book goes up to 488, so the hundreds place can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let me check how many times 4 appears in the tens place. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). How many hundreds are there? From 1 to 488, the hundreds digits go from 1 to 4. So, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit still cycles through 0-9 for each hundred. So, for each complete hundred, there are 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. There are 4 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-499, but the last one only goes up to 488). So, for the first three hundreds (100-399), each contributes 10 fours in the tens place. That's 3*10=30. Now, for the 400-488 range, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 fours. So, total fours in the tens place would be 30 +10=40. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, 40 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. But the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49+40=89, 89+89=178. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49+40=89, then 89+89=178? Hmm, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 40 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. So total fours: 49+40=89, 89+89=178. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 is the last page. So, how many 8's in the units place? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, the book goes up to 488, so the hundreds digits are 1,2,3,4. So, for each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers. So, for hundreds 1,2,3, each contribute 10 eights in the tens place. That's 3*10=30. Now, for the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for the 400-488 range. So, total eights in the tens place: 30+9=39. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (39) + hundreds (0) = 49+39=88. Now, the number of fours is 178, and the number of eights is 88. So, the difference is 178-88=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units place: 49, tens:40, hundreds:89. 49+40=89, 89+89=178. For eights: units:49, tens:39, hundreds:0. 49+39=88. 178-88=90. Hmm, so the answer would be 90 more fours than eights. But I'm a bit unsure because 178 fours seems high. Let me recount the fours in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. Tens place: in each hundred, 10 numbers with 4 in tens. So, 100-199: 40-49, 10 numbers. 200-299: 240-249, 10. 300-399: 340-349, 10. 400-488: 440-449, 10. So, 10*4=40. That's correct. Units place: every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see: the first is 4, then 14, 24,..., 484. How many terms? The nth term is 4 +10(n-1). So, 484=4+10(n-1). 480=10(n-1). n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in the units place. That's correct. So, 49+40+89=178 fours. For eights: units place is 49, as 8,18,...,488. That's correct. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, for 100-199: 80-89, 10 numbers. 200-299: 180-189, 10. 300-399: 280-289, 10. 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+9=39. So, 39 eights in the tens place. So, total eights: 49+39=88. So, the difference is 178-88=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of 4's: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred:\n     - 100-199: 40-49 (10 numbers)\n     - 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers)\n     - 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers)\n     - 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers)\n   - Total: 10 * 4 = 40.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers 400-488.\n   - Total: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 178.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of 8's: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred:\n     - 100-199: 80-89 (10 numbers)\n     - 200-299: 180-189 (10 numbers)\n     - 300-399: 280-289 (10 numbers)\n   - In 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers).\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 39 (tens) = 88.\n\n**Difference:** 178 (number of 4's) - 88 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 450-459 would be beyond 488, but 440-449 is okay. Let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. From 1-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10 fours. From 200-299: 240-249 is another 10 fours. From 300-399: 340-349 is another 10 fours. From 400-488: 440-449 is another 10 fours. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 count as 10 numbers? Yes, because 440 is included and 449 is the 10th number. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Let me count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. - 180-189: another 10 eights. - 280-289: another 10 eights. - 380-389: another 10 eights. - 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check. Did I count correctly? For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49 + 49 = 98.

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last three-digit number is 488. So, the hundreds place can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let me think: For the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Each time the tens digit is 4, the number will have a 4 in the tens place. For each hundred, like 0-99, 100-199, etc., the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, for each hundred, there are 10 fours in the tens place. Now, how many hundreds do we have? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So that's 5 sets. Wait, but 400-488 is only 88 numbers, so the tens digit in 400-488 can be 0-8, but 400-409 would have 4 in the tens place. Wait, no, 400-409: the tens digit is 0, and the units digit is 0-9. Wait, no, I'm confused. Let me correct that. The tens digit is the second digit from the right. So, for example, in 400-409, the tens digit is 0, and the units digit is 0-9. So, in the range 400-488, the tens digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, when the tens digit is 4, it's from 440-449. That's 10 numbers, right? Because 440, 441, ..., 449. So, in each hundred, like 0-99, 100-199, etc., the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, how many hundreds are there? From 0-99: 100 numbers. 100-199: another 100. 200-299: another 100. 300-399: another 100. 400-488: 89 numbers. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, in each complete hundred (like 0-99, 100-199, etc.), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, in 0-99: 10 fours in tens place. 100-199: another 10. 200-299: another 10. 300-399: another 10. Now, 400-488: the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's 10 fours in the tens place. So, total fours in tens place: 10 (0-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 50 fours. Wait, but wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 10 fours. So, total tens place fours: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The last number is 488, so 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, which means 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, for each hundred, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? In 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189: 10 numbers. 200-299: 280-289: 10 numbers. 300-399: 380-389: 10 numbers. 400-488: 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488). So, total tens place eights: 10 (0-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place eights: 0. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for fours. Let me check again. For fours in tens place: 0-99: 40-49: 10 numbers. 100-199: 140-149:10. 200-299:240-249:10. 300-399:340-349:10. 400-488:440-449:10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in tens place. That seems correct. For eights in tens place: 0-99:80-89:10. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. So, 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting the hundreds place, maybe I missed something. Let me check the hundreds place for fours: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Correct. For eights, hundreds place is 0, correct. So, yes, the difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484) \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488) \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488 \u2192 0 times.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nThe answer is \\boxed{90}."

Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 50 fours? Let me confirm: 40-49: 10 fours in the tens place. Similarly, each subsequent set adds another 10. So, 10 * 5 = 50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but I'm only considering the hundreds place. So, yes, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours in total. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. So, starting at 4, each 10 numbers, so 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, considering units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many times that is. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's break it down: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: since 488 is the last page, this set has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, for the tens place, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, but let me check the tens place again. For 480-488, that's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place, right? So, 480 has 8 in tens, 481 has 8, etc., up to 488. So, 9 eights in the tens place for that set. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, totaling 49. So, yes, 49 eights in tens place. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. The hundreds place for fours is from 400 to 488. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For eights, hundreds place is zero. Units place for eights: 8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so how many? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is the 49th occurrence, units place has 49 eights. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 eights in tens place. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, fours:188, eights:98. Difference:90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences (from 4 to 484, stepping by 10).\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences (from 8 to 488, stepping by 10).\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four sets have 10 each, and the last set has 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds place can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let me check for each hundred. - 100-199: 140-149 has 10 fours in the tens place. - 200-299: 240-249, another 10 fours. - 300-399: 340-349, another 10 fours. - 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 fours, but 449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 4 sets of 10, which is 40 fours in the tens place. So, 40 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89, plus 89 is 178. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 40 is 89, plus 89 is 178. Hmm, but let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. That's (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So that's correct. Tens place: 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, so 4 sets: 40. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, total fours: 49 + 40 + 89 = 178. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is the range for the 8 in the tens place. Let's see how many sets we have. - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me count again. Each of the first four sets (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) has 10 eights in the tens place. So that's 4*10=40. Then, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So total is 40+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. So total eights: 49+49=98. Now, the number of fours is 178, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 178 - 98 = 80. Wait, but I'm not sure if I counted correctly. Let me verify the counts again. For fours: units=49, tens=40, hundreds=89. Total=178. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. So, 178-98=80. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Wait, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. But 400-488 is 89 numbers, so that's correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, 49+40+89=178 fours. For eights, units=49, tens=49, so 98 eights. So, 178-98=80. So, the answer should be 80 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10 fours, totaling 40.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. This range includes 89 page numbers with a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **178**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 eights each (40), and 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers fall in 800-899, so there are 0 eights here.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 178 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **80**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{80}"

    "text": " Let me check if 444 is included, but since we're only going up to 488, 444 is fine. How many times does 4 appear in the tens place? For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, in 100-199, the tens digit is 4 for 140-149, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 200-299, it's 240-249, another 10. Same for 300-399 and 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is only up to 488, so does that affect the count? Let me see: from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, it's 10, and there are 4 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). So that's 4 times 10, which is 40. Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's fine. So, 40 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, adding up the hundreds, tens, and units: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 49 (units) = 178 fours. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but let's check the last one. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 100-199: 10 numbers (180-189), 200-299: 280-289, another 10, 300-399: 380-389, another 10. Now, 400-488: does the tens digit 8 occur? Let's see, 480-489 would be the next, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times here. So, total in tens place: 3 hundreds (100-399) contribute 10 each, so 3*10=30, plus 9 in 400-488. So, total 39 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times. So, 30 + 9 = 39. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (39) + hundreds (0) = 88 eights. Now, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 178 fours - 88 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so the hundreds place can go up to 4. Let me think. For the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10. In 201-300, 240-249, another 10. In 301-400, 340-349, another 10. Now, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 more. So, total in tens place: 10 (from 1-100) + 10 (101-200) + 10 (201-300) + 10 (301-400) + 10 (401-488) = 50 times. But wait, does 401-488 include 440-449? Yes, because 440 is greater than 401 and less than 488. So, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in page numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but the hundreds digit is only 4 in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total number of fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? 1-100: 80-89, 10 numbers. 101-200: 180-189, 10. 201-300: 280-289, 10. 301-400: 380-389, 10. 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

The tens digit is 4 for 400-409, which is 10 numbers, and then 410-419, etc., but wait, no, the tens digit is 4 only for 400-409, 410-419, etc., but actually, in the hundreds place, it's 4, so the tens digit can be 0-9. Wait, no, from 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8, but in the 400s, the tens digit can be 0-9, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit can go up to 8. So, in the 400s, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's 10 times for each hundred, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit in the 400s goes from 0 to 8, so the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50 fours. Wait, but actually, from 1-400, the tens digit is 4 in each block of 100, so 1-100: 10 fours, 101-200: 10 fours, 201-300: 10 fours, 301-400: 10 fours, totaling 40 fours. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 fours. So total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in page numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 page numbers. Therefore, the total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. Total: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is included. So, starting from 8, the last number is 488. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. From 1-400: Each block of 100 contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, 1-100: 10, 101-200:10, 201-300:10, 301-400:10. That's 4*10=40 eights. Now, from 401-488: The tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last three-digit number is 488. So, in the hundreds place, 4 can appear from 400 to 488, but that's for hundreds place. For the tens place, it's only up to 488. So, let's see: The first set is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10. Then 240-249, another 10. Then 340-349, another 10. Then 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many numbers? Starting from 8, every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many terms there are. The first term is 8 (which is 8*1), the last term is 488 (which is 8*61). Wait, 8*61=488, so that's 61 terms. So, 61 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800 to 899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (61) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 61 + 49 = 110. So, there are 110 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 110 eights = 78. So, there are 78 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last three-digit number is 488. So, let me list the ranges where the tens digit is 4: - 40-49: 10 numbers - 140-149: 10 numbers - 240-249: 10 numbers - 340-349: 10 numbers - 440-449: 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, each of these ranges contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but wait, does 440-449 include numbers beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because 8*49=482? Wait, no, 8*50=400, but 488 is 8*61. Hmm, maybe a better way is to calculate how many times 8 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. Since every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place, the number of 8's in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and then check if there's an extra 8 in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488). The units digits from 481-488 are 1-8, so 8 is included once more. So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8. Let me count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 numbers - 280-289: 10 numbers - 380-389: 10 numbers - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's)=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, up to 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see. From 1 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so 10 per range. How many such ranges are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, we add 1, so 49 times. Wait, let me check: starting at 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. We need 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. So, (n-1)*10 \u2264 480 \u2192 n-1 \u2264 48 \u2192 n \u2264 49. So, 49 times. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Let me check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10 eights. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: here, the tens digit is 8, but the numbers are from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, how many eights? For the first four ranges, each contributes 10 eights, so 4*10=40. The last range, 480-488, contributes 9 eights. So total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in the numbers from 800 to 899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, did I do that right? Let me double-check the counts. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

    "text": " Let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. From 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers (like 40-49). So, from 1-100, there are 10 fours in the tens place. Similarly, from 101-200, another 10, and so on. How many hundreds are there? Since the book goes up to 488, that's four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, there are 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4*10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, how many fours in the tens place? The tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on. Wait, actually, the tens digit is 4 only when the tens digit is 4, so that would be 440-449. So, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. So, total fours in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, no, because 401-488 includes 400-488, but 400 is already counted in the 401-488? Wait, no, 400 is in the 401-488 range? Wait, 400 is actually part of the 400-499 range, but since the book ends at 488, 400 is included. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. From 1-488, how many times does the tens digit equal 4? It's every 100 numbers, so 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Okay, that seems right. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many terms? The sequence is 8, 18, ..., 488. The difference between terms is 10, so the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes 10 eights. Let's count how many such blocks are there up to 488. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four blocks, each with 10 numbers. So, 4*10 = 40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 89. So, total eights: 89. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 89 = 99. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check the counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 40, hundreds 0, total 89. Difference is 99. Hmm, that seems a bit high, but let me verify each part again. Units place for fours: from 4, 14, ..., 484. How many? (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place for fours: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389. Each has 10, so 4*10=40. Correct. Hundreds place: none, since 800 is beyond 488. So, 89 eights. So, 188 -89=99. Yes, that seems correct. So, there are 99 more fours than eights in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, up to 488, so the hundreds place can go up to 4. Let me see. From 1 to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. For example, 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Therefore, the number of 4's is the sum of units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which gives 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the range for the hundreds digit 4. So, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except for the last hundred, which only goes up to 488. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=188-98=90. Yes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers except the last, which contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = **49**.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
