    "text": " So, total eights are 49 +49=98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours -98 eights =90. Wait, that can't be right because 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I thought the answer was 90, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, correct? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in hundreds place. And in the tens place, 50 fours, correct. Units place 49. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I thought about the tens place for fours, I considered 440-449 as the last set, which is correct because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 sets of 10, which is 50. So, that's correct. Similarly, for eights in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 49 in total. So, yes, 98 eights. So, the difference is 90.

This results in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nAdding these together: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188 fours**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).

This totals 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nAdding these together: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98 eights**.\n\n**Calculating the difference:**\n\nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\nSo, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Hmm, but I feel like I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place.

Therefore, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me think again. When counting the hundreds place for fours, 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. For tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers.
