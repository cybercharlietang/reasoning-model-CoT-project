For the tens place eights: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds. So, 98 eights.

Wait, but I thought the answer might be 90, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes in these problems, the hundreds place might not have as many as I think. Let me check again. For example, in the hundreds place for fours: from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. Yes, because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours. Tens place: 5 sets of 10, so 50. Units:49. So, 188. Eights: units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the number of eights in the hundreds place. Since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit can't be 8, so 0 eights there.

    "text": " So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check my calculations again. Wait, I think I made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me recount the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers, so that's 4 sets \u00d710=40. The last set, 480-488, has 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 40 +9=49. So, that's correct. So, 49 in tens place, 49 in units place, 0 in hundreds, totaling 98 eights. For fours, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188. So, 188-98=90. Wait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me make sure I didn't overcount somewhere. For units place of 4's: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. 484 is 484, so how many terms? Let's see, 484 \u00f710=48.4, so 49 terms, correct. For tens place of 4's: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50, correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place:49, correct. Tens place:49, correct. So, 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, that's correct. So, yeah, 90 seems right.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10th number, resulting in 49 occurrences (from 4 to 484 inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is every 10th number, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. Difference is 188 -98 =90. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me double-check the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 -400 =88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place. And for the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's five sets of 10, so 50 fours. Units place: 49 fours. So, 49+50+89=188.
