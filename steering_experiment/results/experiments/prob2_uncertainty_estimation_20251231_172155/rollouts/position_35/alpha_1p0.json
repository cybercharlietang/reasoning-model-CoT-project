Again, I'll check each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. How many such numbers are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's see how many sets we have. Each 100 numbers has 10 numbers with tens digit 8. So from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Maybe I should think again about the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, that seems right. Now, moving on to counting the number of 8's. Let's do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, meaning 48 eights in the units place, but wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Yes, because 488 is included. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the 8th digit in the units place. Wait, actually, 488 is the last page, so the units digit 8 appears at 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, how many such numbers? From 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would mean 49 occurrences, right? Because 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 count? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that range. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 = 8, but including both ends, it's 9 numbers). Wait, so that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 in 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 40 (from the first four blocks) +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, total 98. Difference is 90.

So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me make sure. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. Yes. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me verify the fours again: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block of 100 contributes 10, so 5 blocks give 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each full block contributes 10, and 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Occurrences: 0.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the units digit. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. How many terms? The first term is 8, which is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets of 10 we have. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counting to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

The first is 8, and the last is 488. To count how many: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many full sets there are. Each hundred block (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm wondering if I counted correctly in the tens place for both fours and eights. Let me re-examine the tens place for fours. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 10 each, 50. That's correct. For eights, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks are 10 each, so 4*10=40, and the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. That's correct. So, the difference is indeed 90.

    "text": " Maybe I should recount the hundreds place because from 400 to 488 is indeed 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but we need to include 488, so that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one more. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, but earlier I thought units place had 49 eights and tens place had 49, so total eights would be 98. But let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFor fours:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor eights:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. And for the tens place, 4 in the tens digit occurs in 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. That's correct. Units place for 4's: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so up to 484, which is the 49th occurrence. Correct.\n\nFor eights, units place: up to 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488, which is 49 eights. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, the difference is indeed 90. Hmm, but I feel like maybe I'm missing something. Let me try a different approach to verify.\n\nAlternative approach: For each digit position, calculate the number of 4's and 8's.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - For 4's: The pattern repeats every 10 numbers. So, in 488 numbers, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4, and then in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), there's a 4 in 484. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 fours.\n   - For 8's: Similarly, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, and in the remaining 8 numbers, 488 is the last one, which is an 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - For 4's: The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each range has 10 numbers. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: one range (40-49), 100-199:140-149, 200-299:240-249, 300-399:340-349, 400-488:440-449. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours, except the last one which is 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50 fours.\n   - For 8's: The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, and the last one has 9 numbers (480-488). So, total eights: 4*10 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - For 4's: The hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n   - For 8's: The hundreds digit is 8 in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 0 eights.\n\nAdding up:\n- 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188\n- 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nOkay, so I think I did it correctly both ways, so the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me add them again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Yeah, that seems right. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is included, so how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would mean 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 count? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, that's 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) contributing 9 eights. So total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me check again. Units: 49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Yep, 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's. For 4's: Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. That's every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in units place? The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1. Wait, that's another way to compute it. So, (488 - 4)/10 = 484/10 = 48.4, floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in hundreds place. So, 89. Total: 49+50+89=188. Correct. For 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. So, same as above, (488-8)/10=480/10=48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9 is 49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0, as 800-899 is beyond 488. So, 0. Total eights: 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10 fours, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. This range includes 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " Let me add them again. 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. Yes, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number with an 8 in the units place is 488. So, starting from 8, every 10 numbers. The count would be (488 - 8)/10 + 1. That's (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 count? But the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such blocks are within 488. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers), 100-199: 180-189 (10), 200-299: 280-289 (10), 300-399: 380-389 (10), and 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many 8's in the tens place here? Each full block (like 80-89) has 10 eights. But the last block (480-488) only has 9 eights because it stops at 488. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks with 10 eights each (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial block with 9 eights (480-488). So that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So that's correct. Tens place: as above, 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 49+50=99, plus 89=188. So, 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 count? Yes, because the last page is 488. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, how many sets of tens place 8? Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, yes, 9. So, 4*10=40 plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers, since 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, each block except the last one has 10 numbers. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for fours. When I was counting fours in the tens place, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. That's correct. And in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many? Let's see, 484 is the last one. So, 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers, as the first one is 4, then every 10. So, 49 fours in units place. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, and the last set (480-488) has 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

Yes, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, let's see how many complete blocks we have. Each block is 100 numbers, and in each block, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 eights in the tens place here. So total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

That's 5 blocks of 10, so 50. Units place for fours: from 4,14,...,484. How many? 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 49 numbers. Similarly, for eights in units: 8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers.

    "text": " Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. For the units place, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place.

So that's correct, 49 fours in the units place. For the tens place, each hundred has a block of 10 where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99: 40-49, 10 numbers. Then 100-199:140-149, another 10.

Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, so let's count how many blocks we have. Each block of 100 numbers has a 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, 0-99:80-89:10 numbers, 100-199:180-189:10, 200-299:280-289:10, 300-399:380-389:10, and 400-488:480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (from 0-399) and one block of 9 (from 400-488). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me make sure I didn't overcount in the tens place for fours. For tens place in fours: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct. For eights in tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Units place: both 4 and 8 have 49 occurrences. So, fours: 49+50+89=188. Eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.

    "text": " Maybe I should recount the units place. Let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 numbers after that. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? The last term is 484, which is 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 484 -4 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 480 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So yes, 49 fours in the units place. Okay, that seems correct. Now, for the tens place: each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct. Hundreds place: from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Okay, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many terms? 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 488-8=480=(n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let me count how many sets of 10 there are. Each hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, right? Because 488-480=8, but including both ends, it's 9 numbers. So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights in the tens place. The last set, 480-488, has 9 eights. So total eights in the tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Wait, let me double-check the tens place. Each hundred has 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which has 9 because the book ends at 488. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, is that correct? Let me check the calculations again. Fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. Eights:49 (units)+49 (tens)=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

    "text": " Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems right. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers are there? The last number with an 8 in the units place is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which would give 48 eights. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488. Let me count: 8 is the 1st, 18 the 2nd, ..., 488 is the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, let's see: each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we stop at 488, it's 9. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, etc.) plus 9 from 480-488. That's 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me check my counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the tens place for fours again. I said from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. That seems right. And for the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. For eights, in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 4 full sets (each contributing 10 eights) and one partial set contributing 9 eights, totaling 49. Units place: 49 eights, as 8,18,...,488. So, 49 eights. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90.

I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last page is 488, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. To find how many times 8 appears in the units place, we can take 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full groups, which would give 48 eights. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8,18,...,488. The first is 8 (1), then 18 (2), ..., 488 would be the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8. Let's see how many sets there are. Each hundred has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. To find how many, we can do (488 - 8)/10 + 1. That's (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place is from 480-488. So, let's count how many sets. Each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, from 480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, for the tens place, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40 and 9, so total 49 eights in the tens place.

Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

So, from 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers), 100-199: 180-189 (10), 200-299:280-289 (10), 300-399:380-389 (10), and 400-488:480-488. Now, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so that's 9 instead of 10. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences (from 0 to 484).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block of 100 has 10 such numbers, totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - This is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks each have 10 numbers, and the last block (480-488) has 9.\n   - Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should recount. For units, every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Tens place: each hundred has 10, and there are 4 hundreds (1-400, 401-800, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so actually, the hundreds digit is 4 only in 400-488. Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-499, but since the book is only up to 488, it's 400-488. So, the tens digit being 4 occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems right. Hundreds digit: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, we'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many. The last number is 488, which is 48*10 +8. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full steps, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book stops at 488, it's only 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems right. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that's a big difference. Let me think again about the tens place for eights. When I was counting the tens place eights, I considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributing 10, and then 480-488 contributing 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct. Similarly, for fours in the tens place, I had 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. And in the hundreds place, 89 fours. So, yes, 188 fours. Eights: 49 units, 49 tens, 0 hundreds. So, 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

There are 49 such numbers.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Let me recount the units place. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That would be 48 fours. But wait, the 48th set ends at 480, and then from 481 to 488, the units digit is 1-8, so no additional 4 in the units place. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 49. Hmm, maybe I was wrong. Let me think again. The first 4 in the units place is at 4, then 14, 24, ..., 484. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The nth term can be expressed as 10n - 6, where n starts at 1. So, 10n - 6 = 484. Solving for n: 10n = 490, so n = 49. So, there are 49 fours in the units place. So, that's correct. So, units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total fours:49+50=99, 99+89=188. Okay, so 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The last term is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, n where 10n - 2 = 488. 10n = 490, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Each of the first four sets (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so that's 4 sets \u00d710=40. The last set, 480-488, is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 +1=9. So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total tens place eights: 4\u00d710 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Wait, that's 49+49=98. So, number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Yeah, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. - 180-189: 10 eights. - 280-289: 10 eights. - 380-389: 10 eights. - 480-488: How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, each of these blocks contributes 10 eights except the last one, which contributes 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4*10=40, plus the last block 480-488 which has 9 eights, so total 40+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights.

I'll go through the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first is 8, the last is 488. How many? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, each block of 100 has 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks we have. From 0-99: 80-89: 10 eights. 100-199: 180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488: let's see, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, we have 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights? Wait, no. Wait, the first four blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contribute 10 eights in the tens place. The last block, 400-488, has 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, but let me check the tens place again. For each hundred block, except the last one, it's 10 eights. The last block is 400-488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, 4 blocks before that: 0-399, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40, plus 9 in the last block, totaling 49. So, units place is 49, tens place is 49, so total eights are 49 +49=98. Wait, no, wait: units place is 49, tens place is 49, so total eights are 49 +49=98? Wait, no, that can't be right because units and tens are separate. Let me clarify: units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. So, total eights are 49 +49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, total fours:188, total eights:98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount the fours. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? Let's see, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 full groups, but 484 is the 49th. So, 49 fours in units. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, eights: units place:8,18,...,488: same as fours, 49 eights. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set is only 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 (40 eights) plus 9, totaling 49 eights. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 -98=90.

    "text": " Maybe I'm overcounting somewhere. Let me think again. For units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus the 4 in 484, making it 49. That seems correct. Tens place: For each hundred, there's a block where the tens digit is 4, like 40-49, which is 10 numbers. How many hundreds are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so the tens digit in the hundreds place for 400-488 would be 4 in 400-409, 410-419,... up to 480-488. Wait, but the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, etc., but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so the tens digit 4 in 480-488 would be from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. Wait, but in each hundred, like 0-99, 100-199, etc., the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times. So, up to 400-499, there would be 5 sets of 10, but since we only go up to 488, the last set is only 9 numbers. So, for 0-399, there are 4 sets of 10 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), which is 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409 (10 numbers), 410-419 (another 10), 420-429 (another 10), 430-439 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10), but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, and 440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place from 400-488. But earlier, from 0-399, we had 4 sets of 10, so 40 fours. So total tens place fours would be 40 + 50 = 90? Wait, no, that can't be right because from 0-399, each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 hundreds (0-399) would have 4*10=40. Then from 400-488, we have 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50. So total tens place fours would be 40 + 50=90. But earlier I thought it was 50, but that was incorrect because I didn't account for the first four hundreds correctly. Wait, but the hundreds go up to 400-488, so actually, the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, 540-549, etc., but since the book only goes up to 488, 540-549 isn't included. So, actually, from 0-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. So, maybe my initial thought was correct, that the tens place has 50 fours. Wait, but earlier I thought from 0-399, it's 4 sets, but actually, 400-488 includes another set. Wait, no, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is another set. So, actually, from 0-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. So, units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. So total fours:49+50=99+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each set: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers:480,481,...,488). So, total tens place eights:10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, hundreds place eights:0. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. So, number of fours is 188, number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I think I might have overcounted the hundreds place for fours. Wait, in the hundreds place, numbers from 400-488 have a 4 in the hundreds digit. That's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, 89 fours in hundreds place. That seems correct. Units place: from 1-488, every 10 numbers has a 4 in the units place. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, and then the 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 units fours. Tens place: as discussed, 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For eights: units place, same logic, 49 eights. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 +9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. Units:49, tens:49, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for fours. Let me recount the tens place for fours. For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, from 0-99:10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, and 400-488:10 (since 440-449 is within 488). So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. So, that seems correct. Similarly, for eights in the tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4 full sets of 10, and the last set has 9, so 4*10 +9=49. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the difference is 90. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 484 is the 49th occurrence).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (including 440-449 within 488).\n   - Number of occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 488 is the 49th occurrence).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block which has 9 numbers (480-488).\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me add them again: 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. Yeah, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. If I divide 488 by 10, I get 48.8, so there are 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, 8 to 488 in steps of 10: the count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many full sets we have. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that right? Let me see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yep, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, with 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each full block contributes 10, with the last block (480-488) contributing 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should recount the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4. But wait, does 488 include an extra 4 in the units place? Let me see: the last number with a 4 in the units place is 484, which is 484, so that's the 49th occurrence because 484 is 48*10 + 4. So yes, 49 fours in the units place. Okay, that seems correct. Now, for the tens place: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is another 10, and so on up to 440-449, which is another 10. That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. And the hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, which would give 48 eights, but since 488 is included, that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. Wait, but let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. The count is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit being 8. So, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 10*4 +9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 +89=188.

Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no: from 8 to 488, how many numbers? The formula is (last - first)/step +1. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. How many such numbers? Let's see, starting from 8, each 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. To find how many, we can take 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. So, 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is okay, but 480-489 is beyond 488, so the last set is 380-389. Each set has 10 numbers, so how many sets? Let's see: 80-89 is the first set, 180-189 is the second, 280-289 third, and 380-389 fourth. So, 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 x 10 = 40 eights. Wait, but does 480-489 exist? Since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of the page numbers, but the tens digit is 8 only from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, so in the tens place, the 8's would be in 480-489, but since we stop at 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. So, the tens place 8's are in 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, that's 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that seems off because earlier I thought units place had 49, tens had 40, but now I'm getting tens as 49. Let me check again. For units place, 8 appears every 10 numbers up to 488. So, 8,18,...,488. How many? Let me calculate (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. For tens place, as I corrected earlier, it's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, that's 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. Wait, but earlier I thought units and tens each had 49, so 98 total. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because I'm a bit confused. Let me recount the 4's and 8's separately. Starting with 4's: Units place: every 10 numbers, so from 4,14,...,484. How many? 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 full sets, but since 484 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, 49 fours in units. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50. So, 50 fours in tens. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total 4's: 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now, for 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, plus the 488, making it 49. So, 49 eights in units. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, and the last block has 9 (480-488). So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in tens. Hundreds place: none, as the book ends at 488, so 0. Total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 8's. Let me think again. When considering the tens digit, for each hundred block, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 exactly 10 times (e.g., 80-89). So, for 1-400, how many hundreds are there? Well, up to 400, it's four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Wait, but 400 is included in 400-488. So, in each of these four hundreds, the tens digit is 8 exactly 10 times. So, 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's:40+9=49. That's correct. So, total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Number of blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89 (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Number of full blocks: 4 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 occurrences.\n   - Partial block: 480-488 contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is the 49th occurrence, right? So, units place has 49 eights. Wait, but wait: from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. So, how many terms? The formula is floor((488 - 8)/10) + 1. Let's compute: (488 - 8) = 480, 480/10=48, so 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so yes, 9 eights in the tens place for that set. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's.

I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? Each full set (like 80-89) has 10 numbers, so that's 4 full sets: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. Now, the last set is 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, in the tens place, 480-488 has 9 eights. So total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 488-480+1=9.

Hmm, so for the tens place, each hundred block from 0-99, 100-199, etc., has 10 eights in the tens place except the last one, which has 9. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total eights in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, is that right? Let me check. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 10*4 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Wait, but let me double-check. Units place: 8,18,...,488. How many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, total eights:49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. That seems correct. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 484 is included).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89 (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 488 is included).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences except the last, which contributes 9.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = **49**.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should recount. For units place, starting at 4, every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The formula is usually floor((n - digit) / 10) + 1. So, for digit 4, it's floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1 = floor(484/10) +1 = 48 +1 =49. So that's correct. For tens place, it's similar. The number of times 4 appears in the tens place is calculated as: for each hundred, 10 times. So, from 1-488, how many hundreds are there? 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488). Wait, but 401-488 is part of the 400s. So, in each hundred, except the last one, we have a full set of 10. So, 1-100: 10, 101-200:10, 201-300:10, 301-400:10, and 401-488: how many? From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. So that's correct. For the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 +89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, 8,18,...,488. Let me check: 488 \u00f710=48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is the last, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 fall within 488? 480-489 is up to 489, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-488, how many such blocks? Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, we have 10 +10 +10 +10 +9=49 eights. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Each hundred has 10 eights in the tens place except the last one, which is incomplete. So, from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total eights in tens place:40 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Let me recount. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 numbers after that. So, the number of fours in units place is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 ends with 8, the last 4 in units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 is correct. Tens place: as above, 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds place: from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The first is 8, last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences.

Each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, but the last one (480-488) has 9 numbers (480 to 488 is 9 numbers). So, how many? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total eights in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me recount the eights in the tens place. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Units place: 49, tens:49, so total eights 98. Fours:188. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again about the units place for eights. The last page is 488, which ends with 8, so the units digit 8 occurs at 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place:49, correct.

    "text": " Let me add 49 + 50 first, which is 99, then 99 + 89 is 188. That seems right. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is included, so how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many terms? From 8 to 488 with a step of 10. The formula is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1. Let's compute that: (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Each set from 80-89, 180-189, etc., gives 10 eights in the tens place. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 +1 = 9 numbers. So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, so that's 4*10=40. Then, the last set, 480-488, contributes 9 eights.

Each full hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4, 14, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8, 18, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences (including 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."
