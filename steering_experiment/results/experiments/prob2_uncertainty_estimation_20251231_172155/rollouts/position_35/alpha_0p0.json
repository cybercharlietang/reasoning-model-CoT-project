    "text": " 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. Okay, that seems right. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, 8, 18, ..., 488: that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count each set: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 10 +10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but let me double-check the tens place for eights. I had 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. For fours in the tens place, I had 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10, so 5 sets, 50. That's correct. For hundreds place in fours, 400-488: 89 numbers. Correct. For units place in fours, 4,14,...,484. 484 is 48*10 +4, so 49 numbers. Correct. Similarly, units place for eights: 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. Correct. So, the difference is indeed 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yeah, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, how many sets of 10 are there? From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but wait, when counting the tens place for 8's, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me recount the tens place for 8's. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, so that's 4*10=40. The last set, 480-488, is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 40+9=49. That's correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. When I counted the units place for 4's, I went up to 484, which is 484, so that's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Similarly, for 8's, units place up to 488, which is 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. That's correct. For the tens place, 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. For 8's, tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. So, 5 sets, but the last one has 9 numbers, so total 49. So, that's correct. Hundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. For 8's, hundreds place: 800-899, but the book only goes to 488, so 0. So, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights. The difference is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to miss a number or count an extra. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately for each digit position and then sum them up. Let's do that again. **Number of 4's:**\n\n- **Units place:** For each 10 numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, in every block of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 is included, we have 48 full decades and then 8 more numbers (481-488). In the 48 full decades, there are 48 fours. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so no additional 4's. So, total units place 4's: 48. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 49. Hmm, which is correct? Let me see: The first 4 is at 4, then 14, 24,..., 484. So, how many terms are there? The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The nth term is 10n - 6. Wait, let's see: 4 = 10*1 - 6 = 4, 14=10*2 -6=14, etc. So, the last term is 484=10n -6. So, 10n=490, so n=49. So, there are 49 terms. So, units place has 49 fours. So, my initial count was correct. So, 49 fours in units place. Similarly, for 8's in units place: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many terms. The last term is 488, which is 10n -2=488. So, 10n=490, n=49. So, 49 terms. So, units place for 8's is 49. So, that's correct.\n\n- **Tens place:** For 4's, the tens digit is 4 in numbers 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-488, how many hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full hundreds and a partial. So, 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) each contribute 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449. So, that's another 10 numbers (440-449). So, total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50. So, 50 fours in tens place.\n\n- **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, 89 fours in hundreds place.\n\nTotal fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Number of 8's:**\n\n- **Units place:** As above, 49 eights.\n\n- **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many:\n\n  - 80-89: 10 numbers\n  - 180-189:10\n  - 280-289:10\n  - 380-389:10\n  - 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n  \n  So, 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in tens place.\n\n- **Hundreds place:** As above, 0 eights.\n\nTotal eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any numbers. For example, in the tens place for 8's, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, but since we're only counting the tens digit, it's okay. Similarly, in the hundreds place for 4's, 400-488 is correctly counted as 89.\n\nI think this is correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This totals 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. Okay, now let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 8 is the first, then 18, 28,...488. Let me check: 488 is 8 + 10*(n-1). So, 488 = 8 + 10(n-1). Subtract 8: 480 = 10(n-1). Divide by 10: 48 = n-1. So n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

So, how many 8's in the units place? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. To find how many, let's see: the last number is 488, which is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the number of 8's in the units place is 49, same as the 4's. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, let's count how many sets of 100 have 8 in the tens place.

So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, 188-98=90? Let me check: 188-98. 188-90=98, then -8 more is 90. Yeah, that's correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which would give 48 eights. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, is that correct? Wait, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, for the tens place, we have 4 full blocks (80-89, etc.) each contributing 10, and the last block contributing 9. So, that's 4*10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that's a big number. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for eights. Let me check that again. For the tens place, eights: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Yeah, that's correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488-8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place is 49. So, total eights:49+49=98. Fours:188. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\quad \\text{(full decades)}  \n     \\]\n     Since 484 is included, we add 1 more:  \n     \\[\n     48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n   \n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.  \n   - Number of such blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   - Total occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     5 \\times 10 = 50\n     \\]\n   \n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n     \\]\n   \n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 50 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 89 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\quad \\text{(full decades)}  \n     \\]\n     Since 488 is included, we add 1 more:  \n     \\[\n     48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n   \n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - Each full block contributes 10 occurrences.  \n   - Number of full blocks: 4 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).  \n   - The last block (480-488) contributes 9 occurrences.  \n   - Total occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\n     \\]\n   \n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: 0\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 49 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 0 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**  \n\\[\n188 - 98 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would give 49 occurrences (since 488 is included). So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So, how many sets of 100 are there? Each set contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's see: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9). Wait, so for the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8, but the units digits go from 0 to 8, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me recount. Each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, up to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? 0-99: 80-89:10. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9. So that's 4 complete hundreds (each contributing 10) and the last partial hundred contributing 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

To find how many, I can do 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. So, the integer part is 48, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 exist? But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such blocks we have. From 1-400, we have 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place in the 400-488 range. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for eights. In the tens place, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 full decades and a partial one with 9 numbers. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. That seems right. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 49, as 488 is included. So, 49 units, 49 tens, 0 hundreds: total 98 eights. So, 188-98=90.

So, starting at 8, every 10 numbers up to 488. How many? Let's see: The last occurrence is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is the number of times 8 occurs from 1 to 488. The first is 8, then 18, 28,...,488. To find how many terms there are, we can consider that each term is 10k + 8, where k starts at 0. The last term is 488, which is 48*10 + 8, so k goes from 0 to 48. That's 49 terms. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is the last set.

So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, is that right? Let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9.

Units place: 49, tens:49, so total eights: 98. That seems right. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8. Let's count each block: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is included, but 489 is beyond the book's pages). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, 49+49 is 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences (with 480-488 contributing 9).\n   - **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. Okay, now I'll do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but including 488, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be the next, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many full sets we have. Each 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), so 9 eights in the tens place. So total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 plus 9, which is 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49+49=98. Hmm, but let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct.\n- Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188. That seems right.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 mod 10. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n- Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 0, as the book ends at 488. Correct.\n\nTotal eights: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed any numbers in the tens place for 8's. For example, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 eights in the tens place. So, yes, 49 in tens place. Units place is 49, so total 98. Yes.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Wait, the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that right? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 89. The difference is 188 - 89 = 99. So, there are 99 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's to confirm. For 4's: Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. That's from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49 (10),140-149 (10),240-249 (10),340-349 (10),440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488. 488-400+1=89. Correct. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units place:8,18,28,...,488. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89 (10),180-189 (10),280-289 (10),380-389 (10). That's 4 sets, so 4*10=40. Correct. Hundreds place: none, as 800 is beyond 488. So total eights:49+40=89. Therefore, 188-89=99. So, the answer should be 99. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. Correct. And for the tens place, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. Similarly, for 8's, 480-489 would be beyond 488, so only up to 389. So, the counts seem accurate. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389.\n   - Each block contributes 10, so 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages with 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 40 (tens) = 89.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 99.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{99}"

    "text": " 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8*49=482? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 8,18,28,...,488. The last number is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, how many terms? The sequence is 8,18,...,488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. Subtract 8: (n-1)*10=480. So, n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's see how many numbers have 8 in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers:480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, that's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 =49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check that again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 +49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Wait, but let me check again because I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place. When counting the tens place, I considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 10 eights each, so that's 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total is 40 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. So, total eights are units (49) + tens (49) =98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

I'll do the same approach, looking at each digit position. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, each block except the last one has 10 numbers. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 fall within 488? Yes, up to 488. So, how many sets? From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but since the book goes up to 488, that's 480-488. So, let's count how many sets of 100 have 8 in the tens place. From 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9.

Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, starting from 8, every 10 numbers. So, the count would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Wait, let me count how many full sets there are. Each 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, fours are 188, eights are 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. That's correct. For eights, in the tens place, I had 49, which comes from 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. Units place for eights: 49, same as fours. So, yes, the difference is 90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for fours. Let me check that again. For fours in the tens place, it's every block of 100, so 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50. That's correct. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. So, the total fours are 188, eights are 98, difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Number of occurrences: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Number of occurrences: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

I'll do the same for 8's, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 is 488, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. How many such numbers are there? Starting from 8, each 10 numbers. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers is that? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8. Let's count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, but let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90.

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers are there? The last page is 488, so the last occurrence in the units place is 488. So, starting from 8, every 10 numbers. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So, let's see: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. But wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many eights in the tens place? Let me calculate. For each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, etc.), except the last one, there are 10 eights in the tens place. So, 0-99: 80-89:10 eights, 100-199:180-189:10, 200-299:280-289:10, 300-399:380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, did I count correctly for the tens place in eights? Let me check again. For eights in the tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. And units place: 49. So, 49+49=98. For fours, units:49, tens:50 (because 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449: that's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50), and hundreds:89 (from 400-488). So, 49+50+89=188. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, 480-489 would be another set, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, how many sets do we have? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last one). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488.

The last number is 488, so how many 8's in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, which would give 48 eights, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488.

But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place, except the last block. Let me count them: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for each of those, so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that's 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counts. Let me recount the 4's and 8's. Starting with 4's: Units place: from 4,14,...,484. The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) +1. So, (488-4)=484, 484/10=48.4, floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 in units. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89. 49+50+89=188. Correct. For 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. So, from 8 to 488, step 10. Number of terms: ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 in units. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, total 49 in tens. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.

Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which would be 48 eights. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 eights in the units place. Let me check: 8,18,...,488. Yes, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, that's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through the eights again. Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. That's 49 numbers, correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights:49+49=98. For fours, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188-98=90.

I'll go through the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the last occurrence is 488. So, how many numbers? Starting at 8, each 10 numbers. So, 8,18,28,...,488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, each full hundred block (like 0-99, 100-199, etc.) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book ends at 488, we have only 9 numbers here. So, that's 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98.

Wait, but 480-489 would be another set, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such blocks we have. From 1-400: there are four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389). Each contributes 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 more eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except maybe the last block.

    "text": " 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488, so how many 8's in the units place? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488 with a step of 10. The number of terms can be calculated as ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. So, how many sets do we have? 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me make sure. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights here. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. This is 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This is 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yeah, that seems right. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Let's count the number of 8's in each digit position. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The last occurrence is 488, which is the units place. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers, and the last set (480-488) has 9. So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188-98 is 90, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That's correct. For the eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but I thought maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place. And for the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, which is 10 per hundred block, and there are 5 hundred blocks up to 400, but wait, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, no, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers), 100-199:140-149 (10), 200-299:240-249 (10), 300-399:340-349 (10), and 400-488:440-449 (10). Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, right? So that's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. That seems correct. Similarly, for the eights in the tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. So, the total fours are 188, eights are 98, difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.
