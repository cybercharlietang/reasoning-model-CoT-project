    "text": " 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Okay, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it does. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count each block. Each block (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one block of 9 (480-488). So, that's 4*10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49 =98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488.

How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let's count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my counts again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I thought the answer might be different. Let me verify the hundreds place for fours: from 400 to 488 inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers, so 89 fours. That seems right. For eights in the tens place, I had 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 488 is the last page. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 10 each for 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 9 for 480-488: 10*4 +9=49. That's correct. Units place for eights: 488/10=48.8, so 49 eights. So, total eights: 49+49=98. Fours: 49+50+89=188. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yep, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 would have 8 in the tens place. So, each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's see how many full blocks there are. From 0-100: 80-89:10, 100-200:180-189:10, 200-300:280-289:10, 300-400:380-389:10. Now, from 400-488: the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, in the tens place, we have 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, the 480-488 contributes 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Wait, that's 98 eights in total. Let me double-check: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights: 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Let me recount the units place for 4's: from 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 89. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct. Now for 8's: units place:8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488-8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4*10=40. Then, 480-488:9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none. So, total eights:49+49=98. Correct. So, 188-98=90.

Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. To find how many, I can do 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers.

Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block.

I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that happens. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences? Wait, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me check: the number of terms in this sequence is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1= 48 +1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 380-389 is included, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. So, let's count how many sets of 100 we have. From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. From 100-199:180-189:10. From 200-299:280-289:10. From 300-399:380-389:10. From 400-488: The tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total tens place eights: 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (180-189) +10 (280-289) +10 (380-389) +9 (480-488) = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no hundreds digits of 8 in this book. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 =90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, eights: units place:8,18,...,488. Number of terms: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, eights:49+49=98.

So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many numbers in each set. Each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, so that's 4 sets \u00d710=40. Now, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So total in tens place is 40 +9=49. Wait, but wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book stops at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This is 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488.

    "text": " 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The last occurrence is 488, which is the units digit. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but wait, 8 is the 1st, 18 is the 2nd, ..., 488 is the 49th. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. But wait, the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is within 488, but 480-489 is beyond 488. So, how many sets? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 89. So, there are 89 eights in total. Wait, let me check again. Units: 49, tens:40, hundreds:0. 49 + 40 is 89. That seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 89 (eights) = 99. So, there are 99 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. For eights: units 49, tens 40, hundreds 0. 49 + 40 = 89. So, 188 - 89 = 99. That seems right.

I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens. But wait, 8 appears 49 times because from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, 488 is the 49th 8 in the units place because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8 is the first, 18 the second, ..., 488 is the 49th because 488 = 8 + 10*(48-1) = 8 + 470 = 478? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 8,18,28,...,488. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. Wait, that can't be right because 188-98=90. But let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the tens place, 4 in the tens digit: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Correct. Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct. For eights: units place:8,18,...,488:49 numbers. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets is 10 numbers, last set is 9. So, 4*10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: no eights. So, total eights=98. Therefore, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly? Let me recount the units place for fours. From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. For eights, units place: same logic, 49 terms. Correct. Tens place for fours: 5 sets of 10, so 50. Correct. Tens place for eights: 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers, so 49. Correct. Hundreds place: fours have 89, eights have 0. Correct. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90.

From 1-488, the blocks are 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), and 380-389 (10). So that's 4 sets of 10, which is 40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, but 480-488 is within the book. So, 480-488 has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's an additional 9 eights in the tens place.

Yes, it's the last page. So, how many 8's are in the units place? The first is 8, then every 10 numbers. So, from 8 to 488, how many?

For the tens place, I had 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, units:49, tens:49, total eights:98. So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9, totaling 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

How many? The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would mean 49 numbers, right? Because 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, except maybe the last one. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, so total 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. When I was counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers. Let me verify that: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, correct. So, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9. So, 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. That's correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. And fours are 188. So, 188-98=90.

So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480 is included and 488 is the end. So, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. So, 4*10 + 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me just go through that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but wait, 488 is included, so it's 49 numbers. Let me check: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so the last set is 380-389. Each of these sets has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, how many sets are there? From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights. So, 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 89. Wait, 49+40 is 89. So, there are 89 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights, I subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 89 eights = 99.

    "text": " So, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. Okay, moving on to counting the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the units digit. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. The number of such numbers is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8 is the first, then 18 is the second, and so on. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks with 10 each and one block with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers (since 488-480+1=9). So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts because it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. Difference:188-98=90.

    "text": " 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence in the units place is 488. How many such numbers? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find the count, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place where 8 appears. These are numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, let's count each set. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 10 +10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9=49. That's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 188 - 98 is 90? Let me check the calculations again because I feel like I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recalculate the fours first. Units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. Now, eights: Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. Hundreds place: 0. 49+49=98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place for eights. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9=49. Correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting the hundreds place, I might have missed something. Let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. That's correct. For the eights, since the book only goes up to 488, there's no 8 in the hundreds place. So, yes, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, the difference is indeed 90.

Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488. That's 4*10 +9 = 49.

So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me make sure. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. That seems correct. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.

Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so the number of 8's in the units place is 49. Because from 8 to 488, each 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place, and 488 is the 49th occurrence. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets are there? 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last one). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40 plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.

Let's go through the same process. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, 8 is the first, so 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me count how many. The number of terms is given by ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Wait, let me check. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, the tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds digits that are 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high.

From 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's five sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place. That's correct.

Let's count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1=9). So, adding these up: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This is 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488.

Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is calculated by (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit being 8. So, how many numbers is that? Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with tens digit 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 because 488 is the last page. So, 10*4 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it's 488, so the units digit is 8. So, how many such numbers? The first occurrence is 8, then every 10 numbers. The last one is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full set (like 80-89) gives 10 eights. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 full sets of 10 (40) plus 9, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, let me check the calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but let me double-check the tens place for eights. I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers. So, 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. Yep, that's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 4 full sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49. So, that seems correct. For fours in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. Units place for fours: from 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers, so 49 fours. Tens place for fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. So, 50 in tens, 49 in units, 89 in hundreds: 188. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0: 98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right.

So, let's count how many full sets we have. Each full set (like 80-89) has 10 numbers. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 40 eights. Now, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for fours, I included 440-449, which is correct because 449 is less than 488. And for eights, in the tens place, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights there. That seems right. So, the difference is indeed 90.

So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights in the tens place, totaling 40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. Wait, but let me think again. When the tens digit is 8, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except maybe the last one. So, up to 488, how many hundreds are there? The hundreds go up to 4 (since 488 is in the 400s). So, for hundreds 0-3, each has a full 10 numbers with tens digit 8, so that's 4 hundreds (0,1,2,3) times 10, which is 40. Then, in the 400s, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488, so that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, 9 more. So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights:98.

Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480-489 would be 10, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, let's count each block: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems right. I think I did everything correctly. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,... up to 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Let me count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me verify the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers, so 89 fours. That's correct. For the tens place of fours, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. That's correct. Units place for fours: 488/10=48.8, so 49 fours. Correct. For eights, units=49, tens=49. Wait, in the tens place, I had 5 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, etc.), but the last one was 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks of 10 (40 numbers) and one block of 9, so 49. That's correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, how many such numbers are there? The first is 8, the last is 488. Let me calculate how many numbers: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that range. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks we have. From 0-99: 80-89:10 numbers. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, so each of the first four blocks (0-99, 100-199, etc.) have 10 eights in the tens place, and the last block (400-488) has 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.

The last number is 488, so the units digit is 8 there. To find how many, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, no, because from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers.

    "text": " 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Yeah, that seems right. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence? Let me think. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488.

Yes, but since the book only goes up to 488, we have 480-488 as part of the tens place 8. So, each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count how many full blocks we have. From 1-100: 80-89 is 10 numbers. 101-200: 180-189 is another 10. 201-300: 280-289 is another 10. 301-400: 380-389 is another 10. Then, 401-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the end. Wait, so in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (from 1-400) and 9 from 401-488. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49+49=98. Hmm, but wait, let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188-98 is 90. But let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in the tens or units places. Let me recount the fours. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. ((488-8)/10)+1=(480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, eights total 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. When I counted the hundreds place for fours, I included 400-488, which is 89 numbers. But for eights, in the hundreds place, there are none. So, that's correct. So, the final answer should be 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any numbers. For example, in the hundreds place, fours are from 400-488, which is correct. For eights, since the book ends at 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s, so no eights in the hundreds place. So, yes, 90 seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None (since the book ends at 488).\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but including 488, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, 8,18,...,488. Let me confirm: 8 is the first, then every 10 numbers. The number of terms is floor(488/10) + 1 if 488 is included. Wait, 488/10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, plus 1 gives 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me count again: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts because 90 seems a big difference. Let me recount the fours and eights. Starting with fours: Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, and there are 5 such sets, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now for eights: Units place:8,18,...,488. Using the same formula: (488-8)/10 +1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. Hmm, that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This totals 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's appear here.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
