So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many sets of 10 there are. Each full set (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers, but the last set might be incomplete. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 full sets (each contributing 10 eights) and one partial set with 9 eights. So, 4*10 =40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That's correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when counting the tens place for eights, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488-480+1=9. So, that's correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Wait, 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8, so how many numbers is that? Each full block (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488).

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98 eights. Wait, let me check: units 49, tens 49, so 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.

So, from 1 to 488, how many full tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the 49th number with an 8 in the units place because 8,18,...,488. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence.

But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page).

So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there? From 1-100: 80-89, that's 10. 101-200: 180-189, another 10. 201-300:280-289, another 10. 301-400:380-389, another 10. Then, 401-488:480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, how many eights? Each block except the last one has 10. So, 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) is 40, and then 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 more. So total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that can't be right because I think I might have made a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place. Let me double-check. When counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). That adds up to 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. And fours are 188. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Alternatively, maybe I overcounted the fours in the hundreds place. Let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488, inclusive. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 =89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. Units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digit occurrences, especially in ranges, it's easy to make off-by-one errors. Let me verify the units place for fours. Units place: every 10 numbers, starting at 4. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484. So, the sequence is 4 + 10*(n-1) =484. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Correct. Similarly, for eights in units place:8,18,...,488. 488=8+10*(n-1). So, 10*(n-1)=480, n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Correct. Tens place for fours: from 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block is 10 numbers, and how many blocks? From 0-99:40-49 (10), 100-199:140-149 (10), 200-299:240-249 (10), 300-399:340-349 (10), 400-488:440-449 (10, since 440-449 is within 488). Wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? 440,441,...,449. So that's 10. So, that's 5 blocks of 10, so 50 fours in tens place. Correct. For eights in tens place:80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 50 fours in tens place, 49 eights in tens place. So, total fours:49+50+89=188, eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, in the tens place for eights, I counted 49. Let me check that again.

From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, because 488-480+1=9. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 8's in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, total in tens place is 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{484}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   Each block contributes 10 occurrences, so:  \n   \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in 400-488.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.  \n   First four blocks contribute \\( 4 \\times 10 = 40 \\).  \n   Last block (480-488) contributes 9.  \n   Total: \\( 40 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\( 49 + 49 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**  \n\\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let's see: starting at 8, each 10 numbers adds one 8 in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's the same as the number of times 8 appears in the units digit up to 488. The formula is floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48.9, which we take as 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. Wait, let me count: 8 is the first, 18 the second, ..., 488 is the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each full set (like 80-89) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many full sets we have. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So that's 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Let me just quickly check if I made any mistakes. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Seems correct. I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does that mean the units digit 8 occurs 49 times? Let me list a few: 8,18,28,...,488. So from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let me count how many sets. Each set is 10 numbers, so 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1=9). So, adding up: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. Wait, let me make sure. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 10*4=40, plus 9 is 49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, 188 - 98 is 90? Let me check: 188 - 98. 188 - 90 is 98, then minus 8 more is 90. Yep, that's correct. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each step again. For fours: units place had 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. 188 - 98 = 90. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check that again. Hundreds place for fours: from 400 to 488 inclusive. 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. For eights, in the tens place, I had 49. Let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Units place: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, which is 49 numbers. Correct. So, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights, difference is 90.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many numbers that is. Each full block (like 80-89) has 10 numbers, so 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9 is 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. Difference is 188-98=90.

Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included, so units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is included, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so we only have up to 488. So, how many sets are there? From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40 eights. But wait, does 480-488 have any 8's in the tens place? Yes, 480-488: the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, right? Because 480 is 4 8 0, 481 is 4 8 1, up to 488. So that's 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, that's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, that adds 9 more eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

    "text": " The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would suggest 49 occurrences, just like the 4's in units place. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 9 numbers (480-488). So, each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which only has 9. Let me count them: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. When I considered the tens place for 8's, I had 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Similarly, for the units place, I had 49 eights. So, 49+49=98 eights in total. And for fours, it was 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. So, 188-98=90.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Let's count how many full sets we have. Each set of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Then, 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does that count as the 49th occurrence? Let me list a few: 8,18,28,...,488. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1 =49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Wait, but 489 isn't included. So, let's count how many full sets we have. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. Wait, let me make sure. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me check that again. Units:49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. Yep. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the hundreds place, I might have made a mistake. Let me verify the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488 inclusive. That's 488 - 400 +1 =89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. That seems right. For the tens place, fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Units place fours: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so up to 484, which is 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units place: 8,18,...488: 49 numbers. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

It's the integer division of 488 by 10, which is 48, plus 1 if the remainder is >=8. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, which is exactly 8, so we add 1. So, 48 +1=49.

So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers. Let me just quickly go over my counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yep, that looks correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and then finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488), which has 9. Total = 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

How many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, because 8*1=8, 8*2=16? Wait no, that's not right. Wait, actually, each step is +10, so starting at 8, the next is 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many terms? The nth term is 8 + 10(n-1). We want the nth term \u2264488. So, 8 +10(n-1) \u2264488 \u2192 10(n-1) \u2264480 \u2192 n-1 \u226448 \u2192 n \u226449. So, 49 terms. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers because 488-480=8, so 8+1=9. So, the first four blocks give 4*10=40, and the last block gives 9. So total tens place eights:40+9=49. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's appear here as the book ends at 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would mean 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included, so units place 8's would be 49. Wait, but let me check: from 8, 18,..., 488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. Solving for n: (n-1)*10 = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, total eights in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 =49. Wait, that's 49. Wait, let me recount: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, total 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Counting fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188. Counting eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the tens place for fours again. I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Let me confirm: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50. Correct. For the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. 484 is the 49th term because 484 = 4 + (49-1)*10 = 4 + 480 = 484. So, 49 fours in units place. That adds up to 188 fours. For eights, units place: 49, tens place:49, so 98 eights. So, 188 -98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Let's count how many sets of 10 numbers have 8 in the tens place. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Units: 49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Yep, that's 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me check again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.
