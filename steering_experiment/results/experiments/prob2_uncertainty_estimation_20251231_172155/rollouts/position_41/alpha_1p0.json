    "text": " The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the tens digit being 8, right? So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many full blocks we have. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and then 480-488:9 numbers because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check the counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right.

Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each set from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 has 10 numbers, but the last set, 480-488, has 9. So, how many sets? From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is included, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many sets? From 0-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 sets, but the last set is only 9 numbers instead of 10. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's to confirm. For 4's: Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each set is 10 numbers, so 5 sets: 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 488-400+1=89 numbers. Correct. So total 4's: 49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units place:8,18,...,488. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

Wait, no: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49.

So, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights. Wait, is that correct? Let me count again: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10=40, plus 9 is 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I thought maybe the hundreds place for fours was 89, but let me confirm that. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, each of those has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. For the tens place in fours, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Units place: 49. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place for fours. I considered 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's five blocks of 10, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50. That seems right. Similarly, for eights, in the tens place, I had 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488, which is five blocks, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. That also seems correct. Units place for both digits: 49 each, which is correct because from 1 to 488, each digit from 0-9 appears roughly 48 times in the units place, but since 488 is included, it's 49. So, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. This is 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Wait, 8, 18, ..., 488. So starting at 8, each step is +10. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. Let's solve for n: (n-1)*10 = 480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8 in the tens place. So, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 9 numbers (480-488). So, that's 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 eights, and the last block from 480-488 contributing 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. Wait, but let me make sure. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed. Wait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. Correct. 188-98=90.

    "text": " The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full steps, which would give 49 numbers (since starting at 0: 0*10 +8=8, 1*10+8=18, ..., 48*10+8=488). So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is within range, but 480-489 is beyond 488, so we can only go up to 488. So, how many sets of 100 have the tens digit as 8? Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 40 eights. But wait, in the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's an extra 9 eights in the tens place. Wait, no, because 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book only goes up to 488, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, in the hundreds place, 400-488: the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. From 0-488, the tens digit is 8 in the following ranges: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Wait, but earlier I thought the units place had 49 eights, and the tens place had 49, so total 98 eights. Let me check that again. Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The last term is 488, which is 48*10 +8. So, starting from 0*10 +8=8, up to 48*10 +8=488. That's 49 numbers, so 49 eights in the units place. Tens place: as calculated, 49 eights. So, total eights: 49+49=98. Now, the number of fours was 188, and eights were 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place. When I considered the tens digit, I had 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. That's 4 full sets of 10 and one partial set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place:49, so total eights 98. Fours:188. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. So, fours are 188, eights 98, difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488. \n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484, totaling 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449, totaling 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488, totaling 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90. \n\n\\boxed{90}"

Wait, 8,18,...,488. Let's check: 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is 48*10 + 8, so yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be another set, but since the book ends at 488, we have 480-488. Let me count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, except maybe the last one. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me confirm. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98. That seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit position again for both digits to check.\n\n**Checking the fours again:**\n- Units place: from 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct.\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, 5 blocks, so 50. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. 488-400+1=89. Correct. So, total fours:49+50+89=188.\n\n**Checking the eights again:**\n- Units place:8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct.\n- Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 sets, but 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n- Hundreds place:0. Correct. So, total eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Wait, but 488 is the 49th number after 8, right? Because 8 is the first, 18 the second, and so on, up to 488 which is the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let me check each block. - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289:10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488:9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488).

So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits with 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Wait, that seems a bit low. Let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so 98 total. Okay, that seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours or the eights. Let me recount the fours. Units place: from 4,14,24,...,484. How many? The last number is 484, which is 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: Units place:8,18,...,488:49. Tens place:80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, but the last set (480-488) has only 9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49.

Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book ends at 488, that set only goes up to 488. So, how many sets do we have? Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). Wait, no, actually, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 in 480-488. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, let me check that again. Units:49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. So, 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I feel like maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me check the units place for eights again. From 8,18,...,488. How many terms? The last term is 488. The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 +10(n-1)=488. So, 10(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in units place, correct. For tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. So, 49 in tens place. So, total eights:98. Fours:188. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the hundreds place, it's easy to miscount. Let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. That's correct. Tens place for fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Correct. Units place for fours: 4,14,...,484. How many? Let's see: 484 is the last one. So, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 49 numbers, which gives 49 fours. So, that's correct. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but let me think again. Wait, in the hundreds place for fours, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, correct. But when counting the tens place for fours, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. Now, for the eights in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, which is correct. So, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the difference is 90.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.

Let me check: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights.

So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 89. So, there are 89 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 fours - 89 eights = 99. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours and eights again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 40, hundreds 0. 49+40=89. So, 188-89=99. So, there are 99 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place. For the tens place in fours, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Units place, 49. That seems right. For eights, units place: 49, tens:40, so 89. Yeah, so the difference is 99. Wait, but let me think again. When I count the units place for fours, I included 484, which is correct, but does 484 count as a four in the units place? Yes, because it's 484. So, 4 in the hundreds, 8 in the tens, 4 in the units. So, that's two fours in that number, but I'm only counting each occurrence once. So, in the units place, every 10 numbers, so 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, that's correct. Similarly, in the tens place, each set of 100 numbers has 10 fours, so 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets, so 50 fours. And hundreds place, 89 fours. So, 188 fours. For eights, units place: 49, tens place:40, so 89. So, 188-89=99.

So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, that would make it 49 numbers. Wait, let me count: 8,18,28,...,488. The first is 8, which is 8=8, then 18=18, up to 488=488. So, how many terms? The formula for the nth term in an arithmetic sequence is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d. Here, a_1=8, d=10, a_n=488. So, 488=8 + (n-1)*10. 488-8=480= (n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49.

So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-489: but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). Wait, no: 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers? Wait, 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, right? So, for the 480-489 block, only 480-488 are present, which is 9 numbers.

But the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Wait, let me check that again. Units:49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. Yes, that's correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers. Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's. For 4's: Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10 =48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each set is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units place:8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 sets, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms (from 4 to 484, stepping by 10).\n   - **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

There are 89 numbers here, each with a 4 in the hundreds place.\n   \n   Total 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Count the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 terms.\n   - **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks each contribute 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights, totaling 49.\n   \n   Total 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1-100: 80-89, that's 10. 101-200:180-189, another 10. 201-300:280-289, another 10. 301-400:380-389, another 10.

So, in the tens place, the 8 appears 10 times in each of the first four blocks (1-400), and 9 times in the last block (401-488). So total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, no, because 480-488 is part of the 401-500 block, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers.

So, the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) give 10 each, and the last block gives 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.

Wait, but earlier, when I was counting the fours, I had 188 fours. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but let me double-check the counting for eights because I might have made a mistake. Let's go through each digit place again for 8's. **Units place:** From 8, 18, 28,...,488. How many terms? The last term is 488, which is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Correct. **Tens place:** 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, fours are 188, eights are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check if I counted correctly for fours. **Units place for fours:** 4,14,...,484. The last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1)=484. So, 10*(n-1)=480, n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Correct. **Tens place for fours:** 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So, 5 blocks of 10, which is 50. Correct. **Hundreds place for fours:** 400-488: 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Correct. So, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any numbers. For example, in the hundreds place, fours are from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. And in the tens place, 440-449 is included, which is correct because 440-449 is within 488. So, yes, 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 fours. So, 50. Units place: 49. Hundreds:89. So, 188.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's see how many full sets we have. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit being 8. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page).

Let me go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's to check. For 4's: Units place: from 4,14,...484. That's (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...440-449. Each is 10 numbers, and there are 5 sets (40-49 is the first, then each subsequent hundred), so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. Correct. For 8's: Units place: 8,18,...488. That's (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) is 10 numbers, and the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So 4*10 +9=49. Correct.
