    "text": " So, total 8's: 49+49=98. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly? Sometimes when counting in ranges, it's easy to make an off-by-one error. Let me check the units place for 4's: 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 10(n-1)+4=484. So, 10(n-1)=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. Correct. For the tens place, 40-49: 10 numbers, same for each hundred. 5 hundreds (0-400), but wait, from 0-400, 40-49 is in the first hundred, then 140-149 in the second, etc., up to 440-449 in the fifth hundred (400-499). But since our book ends at 488, the 440-449 is included, so 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. For the hundreds place, 400-488: 89 numbers. Correct. For the 8's, units place: 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 mod 10. So, starting at 8, adding 10 each time until 488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10) +1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9=49. Correct. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Number of 4's:**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit):** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit):** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, giving 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Number of 8's:**\n   - **Units Place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488), totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488 (9 numbers), totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No occurrences since page numbers don't reach 800.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the hundreds place for 4's was 89, which is correct, but maybe I miscounted somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4. That's correct. For the 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, correct. So, 49 units, 49 tens, 0 hundreds: total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can write a small program or use another method to confirm. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as each digit position separately. Let's try that. For 4's: - Units place: floor(488/10) =48, but since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so add 1, so 49. - Tens place: floor(488/100)*10 =4*10=40, but then we have to add the numbers from 400-488 where the tens digit is 4. Wait, no, maybe it's better to think as: for each position, the number of times a digit appears. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me stick to my initial count.
