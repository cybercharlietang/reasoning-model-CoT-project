For the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the 8's in the tens place, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10, because 489 is beyond 488. So, 9 instead of 10. So, 49 in tens place. Units place, 49, so total 98.

When counting the units place for 4's, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? No, 488 is 4-8-8, so the units digit is 8, not 4. So, the last 4 in the units place would be 484, which is correct. Similarly, for the tens place, 480-488: 480 has a 4 in the hundreds place and 8 in the tens. So, when counting the tens place for 4's, we had 440-449, which is correct, as 440-449 is within 488.

    "text": " So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can check a smaller example to see if my method works. Let's say a book with page numbers 1 to 20. How many 4's and 8's? Let's list them: 4,14, and 8,18. So, 4's: two (4,14), 8's: two (8,18). Difference is 0. Now, according to my method: Units place: 4 and 14: 2 fours. Tens place: 40-49, but in 20, it's only 40-49, which is beyond 20, so 0. Hundreds place: 0. So total 4's:2. Units place for 8's:8,18:2. Tens place:80-89, which is beyond 20, so 0. Hundreds place:0. So, 8's:2. Difference 0. Correct. Now, another example: pages 1-100. How many 4's? Units:10 (4,14,...,94), tens:10 (40-49), hundreds:0. Total 20. 8's: units:10 (8,18,...,98), tens:10 (80-89), hundreds:0. Total 20. Difference 0. Wait, but in reality, in 1-100, 4's and 8's are the same. So, my method works here. Now, let's try pages 1-110. 4's: units:11 (4,14,...,104), tens:10 (40-49), hundreds:0. So, 21. 8's: units:11 (8,18,...,108), tens:10 (80-89), hundreds:0. So, 21. Wait, but in reality, in 1-110, the 8's in units place would be 11 (8,18,...,108), and in tens place 10 (80-89). So, 21 eights. 4's: units 11, tens 10, hundreds 0: 21. So, same. So, the method works.

I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   \n   **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is '8' since the book ends at 488.\n   \n   **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
