    "text": " So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188 -98=90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility I double-counted any numbers? For example, in the tens place for 4's, 440-449 is within the hundreds place count as well. But when I counted the hundreds place, I included all numbers from 400-488, which includes 440-449. But when I counted the tens place, I included 440-449 as part of the tens digit being 4. So, does that mean that the 440-449 numbers are being counted twice? Wait, no, because in the hundreds place, I'm counting the hundreds digit as 4, and in the tens place, I'm counting the tens digit as 4. So, each number can have multiple digits, and each digit is counted separately. So, for example, 444 has three 4's, so it's counted once in units, once in tens, and once in hundreds. So, in that case, each digit is counted separately, so it's correct. Similarly, for 8's, if a number has both units and tens digit as 8, like 188, it would be counted once in units and once in tens. So, the counting is correct. Therefore, the difference is 90.

    "text": " So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can think of each digit position separately and see if I missed anything. Alternatively, perhaps I can write a small table for each digit position and count. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a formula for counting digits in each position. The formula for counting how many times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor(N/10) + 1 if the units digit is >=d, but I think I did it manually here and got 49 for 4 and 49 for 8 in the units place. Wait, but for 4 in the units place, up to 488, the last number is 484, which is 484. So, 484/10=48.4, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, plus the 484, which is the 49th. So, 49. Similarly, for 8 in the units place, up to 488, the last 8 is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49. So, that's correct. For the tens place, 4's: each hundred has a block where the tens digit is 4, so 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these contributes 10 numbers, so 5 blocks (since 400-488 includes 440-449, which is another block). So, 5 blocks *10=50. Correct. For 8's in the tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 49. Correct. So, the counts seem accurate.

Let me check the tens place for 8's. 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, total 98. 4's are 188. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 400-488.\n   - This range includes 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (488 - 8 \u00f7 10 + 1 = 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 eights each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = **49**.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

Is there a possibility that I've double-counted any numbers where both units and tens have 4 or 8? For example, in the number 44, both units and tens are 4, but I counted both digits separately, so it's correct because each occurrence is counted in their respective digit positions.

Wait, in the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. But in the tens place for 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10, because 489 is beyond 488.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as for each digit position, count the number of 4's and 8's separately. Let's try that approach to confirm.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10)=48, but since 488 is included, it's 49. Wait, no, actually, the formula is (n - digit + 10) // 10. Wait, maybe a better way is to think that for each digit position, the count is determined by how many times the digit appears.\n\nWait, maybe a more systematic way is better.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: For each complete set of 10 numbers, there's one 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4, so 48. But wait, the last number is 488, which is 488, so the units digit is 8, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place:49 fours.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: same logic, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 488/10=48.8, so 48 complete sets, each with one 8, so 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49. So, units place:49 eights.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: In the tens place, 4 can be in positions 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many blocks of 100 are there in 488? 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours:40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place: In each block of 100, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, total tens place eights:40+9=49.\n\nFor hundreds digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: The hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nNumber of 8's: The hundreds digit is 8 only in 800-899, which is beyond 488, so 0 eights.\n\nSo, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 188.\n\nTotal eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that confirms the earlier result.

There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place in the range 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges each contribute 10 numbers, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 times more than the digit '8'.
