    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-400, how many such blocks are there? Well, 400 divided by 100 is 4, so there are 4 blocks. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40 fours. But wait, the last block is 400-499, but our book only goes up to 488. So, in the 400-488 range, how many numbers have 4 in the tens place? From 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-489, but we only go up to 488. Wait, actually, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. Wait, no, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. Wait, but 400-499 would have 10 fours in the tens place for each hundred, but since we only go up to 488, the last hundred is 400-488. So, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? Let me think differently. The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers. Now, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 < 488. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours, so 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 40 fours. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me clarify: Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500) would have a tens digit of 4 in the range 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 4 x 10 = 40 fours. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens fours would be 40 + 10 = 50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me recount the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, starting at 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, the sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms can be calculated as ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 fours. That's correct. Tens place: As above, I think 50 fours. Let me confirm: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Correct. Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many terms. The last term is 488, which is 8 in the units place. The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 x 10 = 40 eights. Then, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so it's 9 numbers. So, total tens eights: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Each hundred block from 1-100, 101-200, etc., has 10 numbers with tens digit 8: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, 4 blocks x 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check the counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. Difference: 188-98=90. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for fours. Let me check again. For fours in the tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Correct. For eights in the tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49. Correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488. Occurrences: 0.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - More '4's than '8's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-488, how many hundreds do we have? 488 is less than 500, so we have four complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. Wait, actually, 401-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but since we stop at 488, we only have 401-488. Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently. The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many times this happens. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is 488, so let me check: 8, 18, ..., 488. How many terms? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many ranges: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers because 488 is the last). So, that's 4 ranges with 10 each and 1 range with 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-488, how many full hundreds are there? There's 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's five blocks, but the last block only goes up to 488, not 499. So, for each full hundred, we have 10 fours in the tens place. So, 0-99: 10 fours (40-49). 100-199: 10 fours (140-149). 200-299: 10 fours (240-249). 300-399: 10 fours (340-349). 400-488: Here, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's 10 numbers as well because 440-449 is within 488. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 49 numbers, just like the 4's. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488. So, how many blocks? Let's see: 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, for the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that's correct.

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. So, from 1-100, that's 10 numbers (40-49). From 101-200, another 10 (140-149). Similarly, 201-300: 240-249 (10), 301-400: 340-349 (10), and 401-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let's check: starting at 8, each 10 numbers adds one. So, 8, 18, ..., 488. The number of such numbers is 49 because 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would be the next, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers.

So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't miss anything. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. Difference is 90. Hmm, that seems right.

Wait, the tens digit in 400-488 is 0 in 400-409, 1 in 410-419, etc. Wait, no, actually, in 400-409, the tens digit is 0, then 410-419 has 1 in the tens place, and so on. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. The tens digit is the second digit from the right. So, for 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. So, that's another 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, total tens place fours are 4*10 (from 1-400) plus 10 (from 440-449), totaling 50 fours. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, so I think that's correct. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that happens. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count these. Each set of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-400, that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 more eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, correct. So, tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. Units place is 49, so total eights are 49 + 49 = 98. So, number of 4's is 188, and number of 8's is 98. Now, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8 to 488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number up to 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers as well because 449 is within 488. So, that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's.

So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, no, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me confirm: from 8 to 488 with step 10, that's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers because 488 is the last, but 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let's see: From 1-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, adding up: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours -98 eights=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: Units place: 4,14,...,484. 484 is the 49th number because (484 -4)/10 +1=48.4, but since it's inclusive, it's 49. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For eights: Units place:8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th. Tens place:80-89,180-189,...,480-488. That's 5 sets of 10 except the last one, which is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49+49=98 eights.

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 4. So, in 1-100, there are 10 numbers (40-49). Similarly, in 101-200, another 10 (140-149), and so on. So, how many such blocks are there? From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Now, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, that's 10 more fours. So, total in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Actually, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the 400-499 range, but since the book ends at 488, it's 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. Wait, no: 8, 18, ..., 488. How many terms? It's an arithmetic sequence starting at 8, ending at 488, with a common difference of 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, so from 1-400, there are four blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, that's 9 more eights. So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, let me confirm that. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 480, 481,...,488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, yes, 9 more. So, total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens place:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for fours. Let me check that again. The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right. Similarly, for eights, the hundreds digit is 0 because the book doesn't go beyond 488. So, no eights in hundreds place. So, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total blocks up to 400: 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) \u2192 4\u00d710=40.\n   - In 401-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total blocks up to 400: 4 blocks \u2192 4\u00d710=40.\n   - In 401-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 numbers. That's 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's correct.

Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488.

So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: Units: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total 188. For the 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total 98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, so yes, hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 is correct. Similarly, for the tens place of 4's: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, that's 5 blocks of 10, so 5*10=50. So, 50 is correct. Units place for 4's: 4,14,...,484. How many? 484 is the 49th number because 484 = 4 + 10*(n-1), so n = (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 is correct. For 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is 8 + 10*(n-1). So, 488-8=480, 480/10=48, so n=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, yes, the difference is 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 1-488, how many hundreds do we have? The hundreds digit goes from 0 (for 1-99) to 4 (for 400-488). So, for each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. But wait, for the hundreds digit 4, the tens digit 4 would be from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 488. So, total tens place 4's would be: 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? So yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but does 400-488 include 488? Yes, so 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Let's calculate: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many sets of 10 we have. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So: 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, not 10). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, for the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So total is 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place contributes 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10. 300-399: 340-349, 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers as well because 449 is within 488. So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, total 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. How many such numbers? Let's see: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, the first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. To find how many, we can compute (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me check each set. - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, each of the first four sets gives 10 eights, and the last set gives 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. Wait, is that correct? Let me count again: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - There are 49 such numbers (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - There are 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - There are 49 such numbers (since (488 - 8) \u00f7 10 + 1 = 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four sets contributes 10 numbers, and the last set contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has a block where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers each. How many such blocks are there? From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 fours. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is part of the 400-499 range, which is the fifth block. So, actually, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours are 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. Hmm, but wait, 400-409 also has the tens digit as 0, so the fours in the tens place in 400-488 are only from 440-449, right? So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. So, total number of fours is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me check: from 1-99, how many fours? Units place: 9 (4,14,...,84) and tens place: 9 (40-49). Wait, no, earlier I thought units place from 1-488 is 49 fours, but that's not correct because from 1-99, units place has 9 fours (4,14,...,84). Similarly, tens place from 1-99 has 10 fours (40-49). Wait, so maybe my earlier count was wrong. Let me correct this. Maybe I should break it down more carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position separately, from 1 to 488.\n\nLet me try this again, more carefully.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's:\n\n1. Units place (ones place):\n\nIn every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1 four, so 48 fours. But wait, the 49th block would be 481-490, but our book ends at 488, so we have 488 numbers, so the last block is 481-488. So, in the units place, the number of 4's is 48 (from 4,14,...,484) plus any additional in the incomplete block. Since 488 is less than 490, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 fours.\n\n2. Tens place:\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-400, we have 4 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours are 4\u00d710 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99 + 89 = 188 fours.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\n1. Units place (ones place):\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's calculate:\n\nNumber of complete blocks of 10: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1 eight, so 48 eights. Now, check the incomplete block: 481-488. The units digit 8 occurs at 488, so that's one more. So, total units place eights: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place:\n\nIn the tens place, 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except possibly the last one.\n\nLet's count:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the end)\n\nSo, total tens place eights: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n\nIn the hundreds place, 8 would appear from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place eights: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights.\n\nNow, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49+50=99+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49+49=98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 8's. Let me recount:\n\nFrom 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 (since 488 is included)\n\nSo, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place:\n\n- 40-49:10\n- 140-149:10\n- 240-249:10\n- 340-349:10\n- 440-449:10\n\nWait, but from 400-488, the 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5\u00d710=50. That's correct.\n\nAnd hundreds place for 4's is 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, I think my counts are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but the hundreds place is only the first digit, so yes, each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first occurrence is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The nth term can be represented as 10n - 2. Let's see: when n=1, 10*1 - 2=8; when n=k, 10k -2=488. So, 10k=490, so k=49. So, there are 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let me count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This is 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This is 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in any page number up to 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, let's see: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in each of these 89 numbers, the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one. So, 8,18,28,...,488. That's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488.

Wait, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, so 4*10=40 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Similarly, 201-300: 240-249 (10), 301-400: 340-349 (10), and 401-500: 440-449. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so in the 401-500 range, we only go up to 488. So, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 450-488 doesn't include another 4 in the tens place. So, total tens place fours: 10 (from 40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449) = 50 fours.

Wait, but 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188.

So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for the 401-488 range. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. Wait, but let me check again. The first four blocks (1-400) each contribute 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 fours, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place, so 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n**Final Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has a block where the tens digit is 4. From 1-100, it's 40-49: 10 numbers. From 101-200, it's 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, and 340-349: 10. Then, 440-449: another 10. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, and there are 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500). Wait, but 401-500 isn't fully included because the book ends at 488. So, in the 400s, 440-449 is within 488, but 450-488 doesn't have a full set. But in the tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's another 10. So, total for tens place: 10 (from 40-49) + 10 (140-149) +10 (240-249) +10 (340-349) +10 (440-449) = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. From 1-100: 80-89: 10. 101-200: 180-189:10. 201-300:280-289:10. 301-400:380-389:10. 401-500:480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 488 is the last page). Wait, no: 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the 400s, it's 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has a block where the tens digit is 4. From 1-400, there are four such blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, actually, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So that's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 numbers = 40 fours. But wait, the book goes up to 488, which is beyond 400. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 450-488 would have tens digits from 5 to 8, so no more 4's in the tens place beyond 449. So, from 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought up to 400, but since 488 is beyond 400, does that add another block? Yes, because 440-449 is within 488, so that's an extra 10 fours. So, total tens place fours: 5\u00d710=50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, contributing 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours from units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such blocks are within 488. Each block is 10 numbers. From 1-488, how many blocks of 100 have the tens digit as 8? The first block is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 eights. So, that's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 eights. Wait, but does 480-489 have the tens digit as 8? Yes, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is part of the book. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's an additional 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, no, because the first four blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10 eights, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, the next block would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. Units place: 8,18,...,488: 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers, correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, total eights: 49+49=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my counting again. For fours: units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place for fours. When I counted the tens place for fours, I considered 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's five blocks, each with 10 fours, so 50. Correct. For eights, the tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's five blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49. Correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, especially in the hundreds place, I might have made a mistake. Let me recount the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Correct. So, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights. Difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

There are four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit is 4 in 10 numbers each. That's 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the last set, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, but wait, 401-488 includes 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. So, total in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50? Wait, no, because 401-488 is only part of the fifth hundred. Let me think again. From 1-400, there are four complete hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 40 +10=50. Hmm, that seems correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, total number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 +50=99, 99+89=188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10, and there are 4 full hundreds (1-400), so 4\u00d710=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 89. So, total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set. From 1-488, the sets are: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is included). So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, let me verify: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10\u00d74=40, plus 9=49. Correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check. 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188. 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. Difference:188-98=90.

    "text": " Each set of ten numbers (like 40-49) has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. How many such sets are there? From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in the first 100 pages (1-100), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49). Similarly, in 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. Then 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. 400-488: 440-449, another 10. Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does that count as the 49th occurrence? Let me list a few: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would be the next set, but the book ends at 488. So, let's see how many sets there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, how many sets? The first three sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289) each have 10 numbers. The next set, 380-389, also has 10. The last set, 480-488, has 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9=49. So, tens place:49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me check: units and tens each have 49, so 49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. The difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This totals 49 numbers.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " For each hundred, there's a block of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99: 40-49: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149: another 10. From 200-299: 240-249: another 10. From 300-399: 340-349: another 10. From 400-488: 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, no, that's not right. The hundreds digit is 4 for each number from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which would give 48 eights, but wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480s, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, how many sets? From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189: 10. From 200-299: 280-289: 10. From 300-399: 380-389: 10. From 400-488: 480-488: 9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right. For the tens place in eights, I had 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. That seems correct. Units place for both digits had 49 each, so that's correct. So, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:**\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\n- **Total:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488.\n   - There are 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:**\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\n- **Total:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's: 188\n- Number of 8's: 98\n- **More 4's than 8's:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

From 300-399: 340-349: 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449: 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, let me check 440-449: 440 is the first, and 449 is the last. So, yes, 10 numbers. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me check: 400 is the first, 488 is the last. So, the count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 times. So, units: 49. Tens place: in each hundred, 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99: 10 numbers, 100-199: 10, 200-299: 10, 300-399:10, and 400-488:10. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, but the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 50. So, tens:50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 times. So, units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see: 0-99:80-89:10 numbers. 100-199:180-189:10 numbers. 200-299:280-289:10 numbers. 300-399:380-389:10 numbers. 400-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers:480,481,...,488). Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, the tens place for 8's would be 4 sets of 10 (from 0-399) and one set of 9 (from 400-488). So, total tens place:4*10 +9=49. So, tens place:49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, I'm only concerned with the hundreds digit being 4, so each of these numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me check: 400 is the first, 401, 402,... up to 488. So, yes, that's 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. How many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. So, each of these ranges contributes 10 eights in the tens place except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). Let me confirm: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check if 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, right? Because 488-480=8, so 9 numbers. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but wait, the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (from 4 to 484, inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.  \n   - Number of occurrences: 5 sets of 10 numbers each, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: 89 (from 400 to 488, inclusive).\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188 fours**\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (from 8 to 488, inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.  \n   - The range 480-488 contributes 9 numbers.  \n   - Number of occurrences: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98 eights**\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 fours - 98 eights = **90 more fours than eights**\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

From 301-400: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 401-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but including 488, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8, but the hundreds digit is 4. Let me count each block: - 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). - 101-200: 180-189 (10 numbers). - 201-300: 280-289 (10 numbers). - 301-400: 380-389 (10 numbers). - 401-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, how many eights? Each of the first four blocks gives 10, and the last block gives 9. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the difference between the number of fours and eights is 188 - 98 = 90.

Similarly, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 count fully? Since 449 is less than 488, yes, it does. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers with 8 in the units place? The first is 8, and the last is 488. The total count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let me check each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: Since 488 is the last page, this set has 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, adding up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me make sure. From 80-89: 10. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So, total 10*4 +9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99; 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. And in the tens place, from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, so 50. Units place: 4,14,...484, which is 49 numbers. So, 188 fours. For eights: units:49, tens:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, for the hundreds place 4, the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times instead of 10. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 1-399) and 9 from 480-488.

How many such blocks are there? Up to 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, the blocks would be 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid.

Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th multiple. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (including both ends). Let me count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers.

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 140-149 (10). From 201-300: 240-249 (10). From 301-400: 340-349 (10). From 401-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so the number of 8's in the units place is 49. Because starting from 8, every 10th number has an 8 in the units place until 488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, each hundred except the last has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, and the last hundred (400-488) has only 9. So, how many sets? From 1-100: 80-89 (10). 101-200: 180-189 (10). 201-300: 280-289 (10). 301-400: 380-389 (10). 401-488: 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers each. So, from 1-488, how many such blocks are there? Well, 40-49 is the first block, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10. 240-249, another 10. 340-349, another 10. And 440-449, another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 188 fours. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but including 488, that's 49 numbers. Wait, 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me check: 8 is the 1st, 18 is the 2nd, ..., 488 is the 49th. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Let me count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, total eights in the tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, let me add that again: 10+10=20, +10=30, +10=40, +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

The book goes up to 488, so we have the blocks 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 include 440 to 449? Yes, and since 449 is less than 488, that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book stops at 488, it's 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours = 188. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48 full sets, but does 488 count? Yes, because 488 is the last page, so the units digit 8 appears in 488. So, how many times? From 8, 18, ..., 488. The first is 8, the last is 488. To find the count, subtract 8 from 488: 488 - 8 = 480, then divide by 10: 480 / 10 = 48. Then add 1 for the first term: 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many blocks there are. Each 100 numbers have a block where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks. Now, each block except the last one has 10 numbers. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 488 - 480 +1 = 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks have 10 each, and the last block has 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check that. From 80-89: 10 eights in the tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Then 480-488: 9 eights in the tens place (since 480-488 is 9 numbers). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " For each hundred, the tens place is 4 for 10 numbers (like 40-49). So, from 1-488, how many hundreds are there? The hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. For each hundred except the last one, the tens place 4 occurs 10 times. So, 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 fours. 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 fours. 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 fours. 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 fours. Now, 400-488: The tens place 4 occurs in 440-449. That's 10 fours. So, total for tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's 10. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is included. Wait, 8, 18, 28,..., 488. How many terms? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488 \u2192 (n-1)*10 = 480 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. For each hundred except the last one, it's 10 numbers. So: 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 eights. 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 eights. 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 eights. 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 eights. Now, 400-488: The tens place is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total for tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8? But the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can only be 0,1,2,3,4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has a block where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-400, there are four such blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, no, actually, from 1-400, each hundred block has one such set. So, 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five sets. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 5 sets, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. So, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have a tens digit of 8? Yes, 480-489. But our book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. So, how many sets? Each hundred block has one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. But wait, did I count correctly? Let me check the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place. That's correct. For tens place in fours: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Correct. Units place for fours: 4,14,...,484. 484 is 484, which is 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct. For eights: units place is 8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's five sets, but the last set has only 9 numbers, so total 4\u00d710 + 9=49. Correct. So, the difference is 188-98=90.

    "text": " For each hundred, like 0-99, 100-199, etc., the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each. So, from 0-99, that's 40-49: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149: 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249: 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349: 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449: 10 numbers. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but that's not correct because the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, but each of these contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Hmm, that seems high. Wait, let me check again. Wait, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. Now, moving on to the 8's. Let me do the same approach, counting the number of 8's in units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers is that? Let's divide 488 by 10, which gives 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is 488, so 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: - 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. - 100-199: 180-189: 10 numbers. - 200-299: 280-289: 10 numbers. - 300-399: 380-389: 10 numbers. - 400-488: 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place contributes 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, so total fours are 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but wait, did I count correctly? Let me double-check the fours. Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 484 / 10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, 10 each, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4. So, 89. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 /10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (1s):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (1s):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four sets contributes 10, and the last set contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = **49**.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has a block where the tens digit is 4. For example, in 1-100, it's 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10. In 201-300, it's 240-249, another 10. In 301-400, it's 340-349, another 10. Then, in 401-500, but since the book only goes up to 488, the 440-449 is within 401-488. So, that's another 10. So, total tens places with 4 are 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Wait, but wait a minute, does 440-449 fall within 401-488? Yes, because 440 is less than 488, so that's correct. So, 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours from all places: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's printed is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many? If I divide 488 by 10, I get 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let's see: 8, 18, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let's count how many sets we have. From 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). 101-200: 180-189 (10). 201-300: 280-289 (10). 301-400: 380-389 (10). 401-500: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total tens places with 8 are 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights from all places: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's printed is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, adding those up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

Taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. That's from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.

Now, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, so numbers are 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 488-480=8, so 9 numbers. So, for the hundreds place 4, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488. So, that's 4*10 +9=40+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.
