    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has a block where the tens digit is 4. From 1-100: 40-49, that's 10 numbers. From 101-200: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, and 340-349: 10. Then, 440-449: 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if these fall within 488. 80-89 is okay, 180-189 is okay, 280-289 is okay, 380-389 is okay, and then 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8. So, how many sets do we have? From 1-400, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 4 sets, totaling 40 eights. But wait, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, and that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 more eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me think again. From 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 fours, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's appear here since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 201-300: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 301-400: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 401-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, each hundred has 10, and there are 4 full hundreds (1-400), plus the 440-449 in the 401-488 range. Wait, actually, 401-488 is part of the 400-488 range, so it's the fifth set. So, 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: from 1-488, how many hundreds? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, 401, 402,... up to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 ends with 8, so that's included. How many such numbers? Let's see: The first is 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. To find how many, I can think of it as starting from 8, then adding 10 each time up to 488. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let's check: 80-89 is 10 numbers. 180-189 is another 10. 280-289 is 10. 380-389 is 10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, each hundred contributes 10, except the last one which contributes 9. So, how many hundreds? From 1-488, the hundreds where the tens digit is 8 are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 sets. The first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights in the tens place, and the last set (480-488) has 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for fours, I considered 440-449 as part of the 400-488 range, which is correct, giving 50 fours in the tens place. For eights, in the tens place, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 4\u00d710 +9=49. That seems correct. So, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

From 301-400: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 401-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in the hundreds place, every number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but wait, 400 is included, so 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the book. Let's count: Each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 1-100: 80-89 (10). From 101-200: 180-189 (10). From 201-300: 280-289 (10). From 301-400: 380-389 (10). From 401-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), but wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, the 400-488 block contributes 9 eights, not 10. So total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (from 1-400) plus 9 in 480-488. So, 4*10 +9 = 49. Wait, but wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-488, how many complete sets of 100 are there? There are 4 complete sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. In each of the first four sets, the tens place is 4 for 10 numbers each, so that's 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial set, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449. That's 10 numbers again, so that's another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 more. So, total in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Adding them up: Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. Total fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Let's count the number of 8's in each place. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me check: 8*1=8, 8*2=16? Wait, no, that's not right. Each occurrence is every 10 numbers, so it's 8, 18, 28,..., 488. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The nth term is 10n - 2. So, 10n - 2 \u2264 488. Let's solve for n: 10n \u2264 490 \u2192 n \u2264 49. So, n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each set. Each full hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so from 1-400, there are 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Adding them up: Units place: 49, Tens place: 49, Hundreds place: 0. Total eights = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours: 188, total eights: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations, especially for the units and tens places. For fours: Units place: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total 188. For eights: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. That seems right. For the tens place, 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each hundred has 10, so 4 hundreds would be 40, plus 10 in 440-449, total 50. That's correct. Units place: 49. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units place: 49, tens place: 49. So, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count each block: From 1-100: 80-89, 10 numbers. From 101-200: 180-189, 10. From 201-300: 280-289, 10. From 301-400: 380-389, 10. From 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 480, 481,...,488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 =9). Wait, no: 480 is the first, 488 is the last. So, 488 - 480 =8, plus 1 is 9. So, 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks each have 10 eights in the tens place, and the last block has 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Wait, but 400-499 is only up to 488, so in that block, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, let's calculate: - 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers\n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total number of times 4 appears in the tens place is 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 times. Hmm, but wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: The last number is 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: - 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. That's 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but wait, when I counted the tens place for fours, I considered 400-488 as having 10 fours in the tens place (440-449), which is correct because 440-449 is 10 numbers. Similarly, for eights in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).

Similarly, 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, I need to count the number of 8's in the same way. Let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so integer part is 48, but including 488, it's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place.

So, each of the first four sets contributes 10 eights, and the last set contributes 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488, so how many 8's in the units place? The first occurrence is 8, then every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488). Let's count each block. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers). So, that's 4 blocks with 10 numbers each, and one block with 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-488, how many complete hundreds are there? 488 is less than 500, so we have four hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, actually, 0-99 is the first hundred, then 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488 is part of the fifth hundred but not complete. Now, in each of the first four hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times each. So that's 4 times 10, which is 40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, adding that, we have 40 + 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 440-449 include up to 449? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 10 numbers here. So, total tens place fours are 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but let's check: 8, 18, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each block. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 9 numbers instead of 10. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. There are 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). So, how many such blocks are there? From 1-400, there are four blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes 10 fours, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens place is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds place has 89 fours. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, which is indeed 89 numbers, so each of those contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. To find how many, divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the 49th number because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1-400, there are four blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 40 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and then 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, to find how many more fours than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 4,14,...,484: that's 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. From 1-400, that's four blocks, each 10 numbers, so 40. Then 440-449 is another 10, so total 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488: 488/10 = 48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks is 10 numbers, so 40. Then 480-488 is 9 numbers, so total 49. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total eights: 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again: from 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, each of those 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. For eights, the hundreds place is indeed 0. So, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of fours printed is 90 more than the number of eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has a block where the tens digit is 4. For example, 40-49 is the first block, which has 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149 is another 10, and so on. Let me figure out how many such blocks there are. The hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1, 2, 3, or 4. But wait, for 4 in the tens place, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. However, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can go up to 8 because the book ends at 488. Wait, no, the tens digit is 4, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, how many blocks? From 0 to 4 in the hundreds place, but 4 in the hundreds place only goes up to 449, which is within 488. So, that's 5 blocks (0-4 in hundreds place). Each block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? Let me check: 488 - 400 = 88, so adding 1 gives 89. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it does. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but the last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 exist? The book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the page numbers. So, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes how many eights? Let's see: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, same for 280-289 and 380-389. But 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, total eights in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49). So, from 1-488, how many complete blocks of 100 do we have? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so we have 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401-488. Each complete block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 fours. Now, in the partial block 401-488, how many numbers have 4 in the tens place? That's 440-449, which is 10 numbers.

Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.

Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, which would give 48 eights. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 0, 8, 18,..., 488 is the 49th number. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 1-488, how many complete blocks? 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 eights, so 4\u00d710=40. Now, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488). So, adding that, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

Hmm, so the answer would be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the tens place for 4's? For the tens place, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 blocks of 10, so 50 fours. That seems right. And in the hundreds place, from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units:49, tens:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90.

From 1 to 488, this occurs 49 times (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times (5 blocks of 10 numbers each).\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n   **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times (4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9 numbers).\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n   **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - **Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (like 40-49). So, from 1-488, how many complete blocks of 100 are there? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. In each of the first four blocks, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each. So that's 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial block, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's another 10. So total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but wait a second, 401-488 includes 401-409, 410-419, etc., up to 488. So the tens digit being 4 occurs only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So yes, 10 more. So total tens place fours are 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, the total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. Wait, when counting the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. Now, let's check the units and tens again. Units place: Every 10 numbers, so from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first 4 is at 4, then 14, 24,..., 484. So, how many terms? It's an arithmetic sequence starting at 4, with a common difference of 10, up to 484. The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, 4 +10(n-1)=484 \u2192 10(n-1)=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 times in units place. Correct. Tens place: For each hundred, 10 times. So, 4 hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is another 10. So, 40+10=50. So, total 50 in tens place. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The last one is 488. So, from 8 to 488, step 10. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, 8 +10(n-1)=488 \u2192 10(n-1)=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each complete hundred has 10 occurrences (like 80-89). So, from 1-488, how many complete hundreds? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because 188-98 is 90, but I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. Let me recount the fours and eights. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. Difference: 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 4 up to 484, totaling 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, etc., with each hundred contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 8 up to 488, totaling 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, etc., with each hundred contributing 10 occurrences, plus 9 more in 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-488, how many complete hundreds do we have? Well, 488 is less than 500, so we have four complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-500. But since we only go up to 488, the last block is 401-488. So, in each of the first four blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), there's exactly 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. That's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 fours. Now, in the last block (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Therefore, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th multiple of 10, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 count? But the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-488, how many complete hundreds do we have? Four complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each has 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, in the last block (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, the total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

From 301-400: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 401-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each block. From 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 201-300: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 301-400: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 401-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, the first four blocks give 4*10 = 40 eights, and the last block gives 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, that's 10 numbers as well because 449 is within 488. So, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours from the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, no, maybe I overcounted. Let me think again. Wait, in the units place, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would mean 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, and then an extra 4 in 484. So, 49 fours in the units place. That seems correct. In the tens place, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contribute 10 fours, but wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours. That seems correct. In the hundreds place, numbers from 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that happens. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then an extra 8 in 488. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the book. So, how many sets of 10 are there? From 1-99: 80-89, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, 10. From 200-299: 280-289, 10. From 300-399: 380-389, 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, eights in the hundreds place: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that can't be right because I think I might have made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me double-check. Wait, when counting fours in the hundreds place, I considered numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Then, units place: 49 fours, tens place: 50 fours. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. For eights, units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. So, 98 eights. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but I'm not sure if I counted correctly. Let me think again. Maybe I should use a different method, like counting digit positions separately.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position. For numbers from 1 to 488, let's consider each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place.\n   - Total numbers: 488\n   - Number of 4's in units place: floor(488 / 10) + (if 488 % 10 >= 4, then 1 else 0)\n   - 488 / 10 = 48.8 \u2192 floor is 48\n   - 488 % 10 = 8, which is >=4, so add 1\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers have 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 4 (40-49, 140-149, etc.)\n   - Number of complete hundreds: 4 (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399)\n   - Each contributes 10 fours, so 4 * 10 = 40\n   - Now, check the incomplete hundred: 400-488\n   - In 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers\n   - So, total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488\n   - That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89)\n   - So, 89 fours\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Same as 4's: floor(488 / 10) + (if 488 % 10 >=8, then 1 else 0)\n   - 488 /10 =48, 488%10=8, so 48 +1=49\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers have 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 8 (80-89, 180-189, etc.)\n   - Complete hundreds: 4 (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399)\n   - Each contributes 10 eights: 4*10=40\n   - Incomplete hundred: 400-488\n   - Tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive)\n   - So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488\n   - So, 0 eights\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. But I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot. Let me verify with a smaller example to see if my method is correct.\n\nSuppose we have a book with 20 pages. Let's count 4's and 8's.\n\nPage numbers: 1-20\n\n4's: 4,14 \u2192 2 fours\n8's:8,18 \u21922 eights\nDifference: 0\n\nUsing my method:\n\nUnits place: floor(20/10)=2, 20%10=0, so 2 fours. Wait, but 4 and 14 are correct, so 2 fours.\n\nTens place: 40-49 etc., but in 1-20, there's no tens digit 4, so 0.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal fours:2\n\nUnits place for 8's: floor(20/10)=2, 20%10=0, so 2 eights (8,18)\n\nTens place: 80-89 not in 1-20, so 0.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal eights:2\n\nDifference:0. Correct.\n\nAnother test: 50 pages.\n\n4's:\n\nUnits: 4,14,24,34,44 \u21925\n\nTens:40-49 \u219210\n\nHundreds:0\n\nTotal fours:15\n\n8's:\n\nUnits:8,18,28,38,48 \u21925\n\nTens:40-49: no, 80-89 not in 1-50, so 0\n\nHundreds:0\n\nTotal eights:5\n\nDifference:10 fours more.\n\nUsing my method:\n\nUnits fours: floor(50/10)=5, 50%10=0, so 5.\n\nTens fours: 40-49 \u219210\n\nHundreds:0\n\nTotal fours:15\n\nUnits eights: floor(50/10)=5, 50%10=0, so 5.\n\nTens eights: 80-89 not in 1-50, so 0.\n\nTotal eights:5\n\nDifference:10. Correct.\n\nSo, my method works for smaller numbers. Therefore, applying it to 488 pages, the difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has a block where the tens digit is 4. Each such block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers) From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers) From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers) From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 488 include 440-449? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. The count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. Total fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 ends with 88, so the last number with 8 in units place is 488. How many such numbers? Let's see: The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. To find how many terms, we can consider it as an arithmetic sequence starting at 8, ending at 488, with a common difference of 10. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. Solving for n: 8 + 10(n-1) = 488 \u2192 10(n-1) = 480 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 8, contributing 10 numbers. So, from 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers) From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers) From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers) From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: Units place: 49, Tens place: 49, Hundreds place: 0. Total eights = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of eights from the total number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term 4, common difference 10, and last term 484. The number of terms is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of terms} = \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n   So, 49 fours in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such ranges:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 10 = 50\n   \\]\n   So, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. The count is:\n   \\[\n   488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n   \\]\n   So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n\\[\n49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term 8, common difference 10, and last term 488. The number of terms is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of terms} = \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n   So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 eights each, and the last range contributes 9 eights:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\n   \\]\n   So, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n\\[\n49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**\n\\[\n188 - 98 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

There's 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. So yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position separately. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has one such block. So, 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 blocks with 10 each, and one block with 9. So, 4*10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-400, that's 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, no, that's not right. Because from 1-400, each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers, so total is 40 + 10 = 50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but I think I'm making a mistake here. Because the hundreds digit is only 4 in the numbers where the hundreds place is 4, which is from 400 to 499. But since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, the number of fours in the hundreds place is 89. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so yes, 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. Hmm, but I think I might have overcounted somewhere. Let me double-check. Maybe I should use a formula or a better method. Alternatively, I can think of each digit position separately and calculate how many times 4 appears in each position from 1 to 488. Let me try that again. For the units place: In every block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1 four in the units place, so 48 fours. But wait, the last number is 488, which is the 489th number. So, the units digit 4 appears 48 times in the complete blocks, and then we have to check if the 489th number has a 4 in the units place. The 489th number is 488, whose units digit is 8, so no additional 4. So, units place has 48 fours. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 49. Hmm, which is correct? Let me list some numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. How many numbers is that? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The formula for the number of terms is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 fours. So, my initial calculation was correct. So, units place: 49 fours. Now, tens place: In each block of 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 ten times each. So, in each block of 100, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens fours: 40 + 10 = 50. So, tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, hundreds place: 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, in every block of 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488/10 = 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1 eight, so 48 eights. But wait, the last number is 488, which is the 489th number. The units digit of 488 is 8, so that's an additional eight. So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 eights. Alternatively, using the formula: numbers ending with 8 from 1 to 488. The first is 8, last is 488. Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** In each block of 100 numbers, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, how many complete blocks of 100 are there? 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens eights: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, yes, 9 eights. So, tens place: 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems a big difference. Let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. And for the tens place, 50 fours, which includes 10 in each hundred up to 400, and then 10 more in 440-449. So, that's correct. For eights, in the tens place, in the last partial block, 480-488 gives 9 eights, which is correct because 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, yes, 49 in units, 49 in tens, total 98 eights. So, the difference is indeed 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference between their counts.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in numbers 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.

From 301-400: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 401-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is only 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but does 488 have a hundreds digit of 4? Yes, because 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, yes, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 1-488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. That's correct.

Then from 401-488, another 10 fours (440-449). So, total tens place fours: 40 +10=50. That's correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 +89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8's in the tens place occur in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count each block. From 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 180-189 (10). From 201-300: 280-289 (10). From 301-400: 380-389 (10). From 401-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but let me confirm. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place eights:49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights:0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (including 440-449).\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488), which contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100: 40-49: 10 numbers. From 101-200: 140-149: 10 numbers. From 201-300: 240-249: 10 numbers. From 301-400: 340-349: 10 numbers. From 401-488: 440-449: 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-100: 80-89: 10 numbers. From 101-200: 180-189: 10 numbers. From 201-300: 280-289: 10 numbers. From 301-400: 380-389: 10 numbers. From 401-488: 480-488: How many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, total tens place eights: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place. How many hundreds are there up to 488? Let's see: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. That's 5 sets. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 fours = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. To find the count, I can take (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. Let's count each set. - 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 eights. - 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 eights. - 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 eights. - 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 eights. - 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 eights in the tens place here. So, total in tens place: 4 sets \u00d7 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98.

From 201-300, 240-249: another 10. From 301-400, 340-349: another 10. From 401-488, 440-449: that's another 10. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, we have 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers are there? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, the number of 8's in the units place is (488 - 8)/10 + 1. Let me compute that: (488 - 8) = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the book.

From 401-488: 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, we have 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Checking fours: Units place: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. Correct. Checking eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, since 800+ is beyond 488. So, 0. Total eights: 49+49=98.

From 0-488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, for hundreds digit 0: 40-49: 10 fours. For hundreds digit 1: 140-149: 10 fours. For hundreds digit 2: 240-249: 10 fours. For hundreds digit 3: 340-349: 10 fours. For hundreds digit 4: 440-449: 10 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. The first is 8, the last is 488. How many? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389.

So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights. Wait, but let me check: from 0-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, for hundreds 0: 80-89: 10. Hundreds 1: 180-189: 10. Hundreds 2: 280-289: 10. Hundreds 3: 380-389: 10. Hundreds 4: 480-488: 9. So, total is 10*4 +9=49. So, tens place contributes 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Checking fours: units place: 4,14,...,484. From 0 to 484, how many? The formula is floor((484 - 4)/10) +1 = floor(480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 blocks, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now for eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. From 0 to 488, how many? Let's see: 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 4 full blocks of 10, and one partial block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me think again. For fours in hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 fours. For tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So that's 5 blocks, each 10, so 50 fours. Units place: 4,14,...,484: 49 fours. So, 89+50+49=188. Correct. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488: 49 eights. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100, 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 101-200, 140-149 is another 10. From 201-300, 240-249 is 10. From 301-400, 340-349 is 10. From 401-488, 440-449 is another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 times, so 5*10=50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. The first is 8, which is the 1st, then 18 is 2nd, ..., 488 is the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8. Let's count how many sets of 10 there are. From 1-100: 80-89:10 numbers. 101-200:180-189:10. 201-300:280-289:10. 301-400:380-389:10. 401-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488). Wait, so the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and 1 set of 9 (480-488). So, that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. The difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:**\n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - There are 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:**\n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.  \n\\boxed{90}"

The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. How many terms? Let's calculate (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488.

So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds places with 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Therefore, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're counting whole numbers, it's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so from 8 to 488, stepping by 10.

Let's count each set. - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: here, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens place contributes 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, but let me think again. Each hundred block has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except for the last block. So, from 1-400, we have four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 eights. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 x 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

Wait, actually, from 1-400, each hundred has one set of 10 numbers with tens digit 4, so that's 10 per hundred. There are four hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, 400-488 is part of the fifth hundred, but we only go up to 488. So, let's see: 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.

Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Each hundred has 10 such numbers. From 1-400, that's 400/10 = 40 numbers, and then from 401-488, we have 488 - 400 = 88, so 88/10 = 8.8, so 8 full tens, so 8 more numbers: 408, 418, ..., 488. Wait, but 488 is the last one, so that's 9 numbers in 400-488? Wait, no, let's count properly. From 1-400, how many 8's in units place? 8,18,...,398: that's 400/10 = 40. Then from 401-488, how many? The first 8 in units place is 408, then 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers. So total units place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-400: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 \u2192 4 sets, each contributing 10, so 40. Then from 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 201-300: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 301-400: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 401-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, starting at 8, the last one is 488. How many are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, adding these up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights from each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers has a 4 in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, from 1-488, how many full blocks of 100 are there? There are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens place can be 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total fours in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups, each contributing an 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, how many 8's in the units place? Let's calculate: The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8's in the tens place occur in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each block. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last block, which might be partial. From 1-400: there are 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens place can be 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, that's 9 eights. Wait, but 480-489 would be a full block, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 9 numbers. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, so 98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but I feel like maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me check the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. For the tens place, in the hundreds, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 50 in total for tens. Units place, 49 fours. So, 188 fours. For eights, units place: 49, tens place: 49. So, 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but let me think again. When counting the tens place for fours, I included 440-449, which is correct. But when counting the tens place for eights, in 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40 (from 1-400) +9=49. That seems correct. So, 90 is the answer. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems a big difference. Let me check another way. Maybe I can count the number of times each digit appears in each position. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the tens place, 4 in the tens occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place. Correct. Units place: 49 fours. So, 188 total fours. For eights: units place, 49 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. So, 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Wait, 40-49 is in the first 100, then 140-149 in the second, 240-249 in the third, 340-349 in the fourth, and 440-449 in the fifth. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many sets? Let me think. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10. 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10. 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10. 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is 488, which is the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but including 488, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is included, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, how many sets? From 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10. 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10. 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10. 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10. 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers (since 488 is the last one). So, that's 4 sets with 10 each, and one set with 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = **49**.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Similarly, 201-300: 240-249, another 10. 301-400: 340-349, another 10. Now, from 401-488: 440-449 is another 10. So, how many blocks is that? From 1-400, we have 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. Then, 401-488 includes another 10 fours (440-449). So, total tens place fours: 4*10 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 401-488 is only 88 numbers, so 440-449 is within that range, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Therefore, the total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. But wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: Each hundred block has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4, and there are 4 full blocks (1-400) plus the 440-449 in 401-488, so 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The last number is 488, so the sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-100: 80-89, 10 numbers. 101-200: 180-189, 10 numbers. 201-300: 280-289, 10 numbers. 301-400: 380-389, 10 numbers. Now, 401-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, in the tens place, 480-488 contributes 9 eights, not 10. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (from 1-400) plus 9 in 401-488. So, 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check the counts. For 4's: Units:49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

Let me count how many full sets we have. From 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, each of the first four sets contributes 10, and the last set contributes 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. For eights: units: 49, tens: 49. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, so the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check the tens place for eights again. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? So, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place for that last set. So, 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10=40 plus 9=49. That seems correct. And units place: 488 is the last page, so 488 is included, making it 49 eights in the units place. So, units:49, tens:49, total eights:98. For fours, hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours there. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Units place: 4,14,...,484, which is 49 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-488, how many complete sets of 100 are there? There are 4 complete sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10 = 40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 page numbers. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 count? Yes, because the units digit is 8. So, how many such numbers? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms can be calculated as (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would also have tens digit 8, but the book only goes up to 488. So, how many complete sets? Let's see: 80-89 is in 1-100, 180-189 in 101-200, 280-289 in 201-300, 380-389 in 301-400, and 480-488 in 401-488. So, each of the first four sets (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10 = 40. Now, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, total tens place eights are 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights are 0. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484), totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n  \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488), totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Wait, actually, from 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. Then 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249 is 10, 300-399: 340-349 is 10, and 400-488: 440-449 is another 10. Wait, 400-488: 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but including 488, that's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: from 8, 18, ..., 488. The sequence is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 8. So, from 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189 is 10. 200-299: 280-289 is 10. 300-399: 380-389 is 10. 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one block of 9. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights in each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so it's valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). But wait, in the hundreds place, only the first digit is 4, so each of these numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Wait, but actually, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.

The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. Yes, because 488 is the last page. So, starting from 8, every 10th number up to 488. Let me count: The first is 8 (1), then 18 (2), ..., up to 488. So, how many terms? The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The nth term is 8 + 10(n-1). Setting this equal to 488: 8 +10(n-1)=488 \u2192 10(n-1)=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, there are 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such blocks are within 488. The first block is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). The next would be 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, we have only 9 numbers in this block: 480-488. So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =49+49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98.

Wait, but from 401-488, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 only in the numbers 400-488.

The last number is 488, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488.

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers (like 0-99, 100-199, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: from 400-488, the tens place can be 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 5 sets, 10 each, so 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let me check each hundred. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, how many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 0-399) and 9 in 400-488. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 188. For eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems right. But let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the tens place in fours, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. That seems right because from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's correct. For the eights, in the tens place, I had 4 sets of 10 and 9 in the last set, totaling 49. That seems right because 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, yeah, I think 90 is the correct difference.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   There are 49 occurrences (from 4 to 484, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   Each set contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in 400-488.  \n   There are 89 occurrences (400 to 488 inclusive).\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   There are 49 occurrences (from 8 to 488, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   The first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**\n\nSo, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers (like 0-99, 100-199, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99: 40-49, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, 10 more. From 300-399: 340-349, 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers as well because 449 is within 488. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but from 400-488, the tens digit being 4 is only up to 449, which is correct because 450 would have a tens digit of 5. So, yes, 10 numbers. So total tens place fours are 5*10=50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-499, but since our book ends at 488, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So units place is 49. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. From 0-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:10. Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So yes, 5 sets, 10 each, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480-489 would be 10, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, how many sets? Let's see: 0-99:80-89, that's 10 numbers. 100-199:180-189, another 10. 200-299:280-289, 10. 300-399:380-389, 10. 400-488:480-488, which is 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but 400-488: tens digit 8 is from 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place eights: 0. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, but wait, let me double-check the tens place. From 0-99:80-89 is 10. 100-199:180-189 is 10. 200-299:280-289 is 10. 300-399:380-389 is 10. 400-488:480-488 is 9. So that's 4*10 +9=49. So total eights:49+49=98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me check again. Fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   - Each set of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such sets.  \n   - Number of occurrences: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.  \n   - The first four sets each contribute 10 occurrences, and the last set contributes 9.  \n   - Number of occurrences: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
