    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers has one such set where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-488, how many hundreds are there? Let's see: 1-99: 10 numbers (40-49). 100-199: another 10. 200-299: another 10. 300-399: another 10. 400-488: here, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 400-488: does 440-449 fit into 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one 8 in the units place. The total number is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The difference between 8 and 488 is 480, which divided by 10 is 48 intervals, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). Let me count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers has one set of 10 where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-488, how many hundreds are there? Let's see: 1-99: 10 times (40-49). 100-199: 10 times (140-149). 200-299: 10 times (240-249). 300-399: 10 times (340-349). 400-488: 10 times (440-449). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 10 (from 40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449) = 50 times. Hmm, but wait, 40-49 is 10 numbers, same for each hundred. Since 488 is less than 500, the 400-488 range includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, but wait, in the units place, I thought it was 49, but let me confirm. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, starting at 4. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. Solving for n: (n-1)*10 = 480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So yes, 49 fours in the units place. Tens place: each hundred block has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. There are 5 hundred blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but in 400-488, the tens digit can be 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is included. So, how many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. Let's solve for n: (n-1)*10 \u2264 480 => n-1 \u2264 48 => n \u226449. So, n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, so the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers because 488-480=8, so 9 numbers. So, the tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So total 10*4 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check the counts. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't overcount in the tens place for 4's. For 4's in the tens place, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, so 50. That seems right. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488, which is 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. That seems correct. So, yes, the difference is 90. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 484 is the 49th term).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in sets like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each hundred block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - Number of occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 488 is the 49th term).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in sets like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each hundred block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last set (480-488), which contributes 9.\n   - Number of occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours. So, 4*10 = 40. Now, from 401-488, the tens place can be 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many that is. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so the count should be 49, right? Because from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. - 180-189: another 10 eights. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: since 488 is the last page, how many numbers are there? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, the number of 8's is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, no, that's not right. Each set before 480-489 contributes 10 eights, and the last set contributes 9 because it stops at 488. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, which is 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Each set contributes 10 fours, so 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. How many terms? Let's subtract 8 from 488: 488 - 8 = 480. Then divide by 10: 480 / 10 = 48. Then add 1 for the first term: 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many sets there are. The first set is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers because 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 full sets (each contributing 10 eights) and one partial set contributing 9 eights. So, 4\u00d710 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total eights are units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

The last occurrence is at 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.

So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 4*10=40 eights. The last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So total in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

From 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let's check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Yes, 488 is included, so that's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, let me count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers). So, total eights in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights from each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98.

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers has one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-488, how many complete hundreds are there? Well, 488 is less than 500, so we have 4 complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. Wait, actually, 401-488 is part of the 400s, so the tens digit being 4 occurs in 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). But 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is only 10 numbers, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480s, so the tens digit is 8 there. Let's count each set. Each set contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, how many such sets are there? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 in 9 of them, not 10. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 fours. Wait, but let me double-check: 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. The count is indeed 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, how many such numbers? Let's see: the first is 8, the last is 488. To find how many, we can divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, 8,18,...,488. Let's check: 8 is 8, 18 is 18, ..., 488 is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set. - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, in the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me make sure: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only if the number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's. But let me think again, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For eights, in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 eights, and the last set has 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That's correct. Units place for eights: 8,18,...,488, which is 49 numbers. So, 49+49=98. So, yes, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but our book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, how many sets do we have? From 1-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is another 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is another 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is another 10. From 400-488: 480-488 is part of this. So, how many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, etc.) and then 9 in the last set. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

So, total is 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each set contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers has one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100, there are 10 numbers (40-49). From 101-200, another 10 (140-149), and so on. Let's see how many hundreds we have. Since the book has 488 pages, we have 4 hundreds: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, but the last one is only up to 488, so let me adjust. For the hundreds place, each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, from 1-100: 10 fours. 101-200: 10 fours. 201-300: 10 fours. 301-400: 10 fours. Now, 401-488: Here, the tens digit is 4 for numbers 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 fours. Wait, but 488 is beyond 449, so does that affect the count? No, because 440-449 is entirely within 401-488. So, that's 10 fours. So, adding up: 10 (1-100) + 10 (101-200) + 10 (201-300) + 10 (301-400) + 10 (401-488) = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me double-check. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 hundreds would give 40 fours. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 more, making it 50. Yes, that seems correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. To find how many, I can do (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 40 eights. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=90. Hmm, seems correct, but let me check if I missed anything. Wait, in the tens place for eights, I counted 480-488 as 9 numbers, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, that's correct. Similarly, in the hundreds place for fours, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Yes, that's correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - This is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, totaling 40. The range 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = **49**.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book only goes up to 488.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's.

Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but the hundreds digit is 4, so that's valid. Let's count each block. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is another 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is another 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is another 10. From 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 480 is the first, then 481, ..., up to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place 4, the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times. So, adding up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought units place had 49, tens had 49, so total eights would be 98. But let me double-check the tens place. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10. 100-199: 180-189 is 10. 200-299: 280-289 is 10. 300-399: 380-389 is 10. 400-488: 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, when counting the fours in the units place, I thought it was 49, but let me recount. From 4,14,24,...,484. How many numbers is that? The first is 4, and the last is 484. The number of terms in the sequence can be calculated as ((484 -4)/10) +1. So, (480/10)+1=48+1=49. That's correct. So, units place for fours is 49.\n\nFor tens place, fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. That's correct.\n\nNow, for eights:\n\nUnits place:8,18,28,...,488. The last one is 488. So, how many terms? The sequence is 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1=(480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each block except the last has 10 numbers, and the last has 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's correct, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place is where the digit is in the third position. For numbers 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.

Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 0 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, which would give 48 eights. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 0-99: 10 eights, 100-199: 10, 200-299: 10, 300-399: 10, and 400-488: the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 for all these, so that's 9 eights in the tens place for the 400-488 block. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (0-399) and 9 in 400-488. So, 4 * 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " Each set (like 40-49) has 10 numbers, so each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many such sets are there? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the units place. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers add one more. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is included, so it's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place has 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 would have 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Let me count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10 eights. - 280-289: another 10 eights. - 380-389: another 10 eights. - 480-488: here, only 9 numbers because 489 is beyond 488, so 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can only have 8 if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units: 49, tens: 49, so 98. 188-98=90.

From 300-399: 340-349 is another 10. From 400-488: 440-449 is another 10, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 10 (from 40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449) = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488, so the units digit is 8. To find how many such numbers, we can divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8, but the units digits go from 0 to 8, so that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens place eights are 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours: 188, total eights: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts, especially for the tens place in fours and eights. For fours in the tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. That seems correct. For eights in the tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That also seems correct. Units place: both 4 and 8 have 49 each, which makes sense since the last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence for both in the units place. Now, hundreds place: fours have 89, and eights have 0. So, total fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188. Eights:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98. Difference:188-98=90. So, I think that's correct.

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences in the tens place. So, from 1-488, how many hundreds are there? Well, 488 is in the 400-488 range, so the hundreds are 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's four sets. But wait, the first set (100-199) has 10 fours in the tens place (140-149), the second set (200-299) has 10 fours (240-249), the third set (300-399) has 10 fours (340-349), and the fourth set (400-488) has 10 fours (440-449). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40 fours in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 40 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but is that correct? Let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since our book ends at 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89; 89 + 89 = 178. So, total number of fours is 178. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me check how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, how many numbers? Let me see: 8, 18, ..., 488. The number of terms can be calculated as ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each hundred has 10 occurrences in the tens place. So, from 1-488, how many sets? 1-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 eights. 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 eights. 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 eights. 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 eights. 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 eights (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so it's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, the first four sets (1-399) contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights, and the last set (400-488) contributes 9 eights. So total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights in the hundreds place: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of eights is 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, 178 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 80.

    "text": " Each of these sets (40-49, 140-149, etc.) has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Now, how many such sets are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149 is the second, 240-249 third, 340-349 fourth, and 440-449 fifth. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, 449 is less than 488, so all five sets are valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the units place. Let me recount the units place. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so for each complete set of 10, there's one 4 in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last number in the units place is 8, which is less than 488. Wait, no, 488 is the page number, so the units digit of 488 is 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be at 484, which is the 48th occurrence because 484 is 48*10 + 4. So, 48 fours in the units place. Then, the tens place: 5 sets of 10, each giving 10 fours, so 50. Hundreds place: 89 fours. So, total fours: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Wait, that's different from my initial 188. So, which is correct? Let me think again. The units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10 => 480 = (n-1)*10 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 fours in the units place. Wait, so that's conflicting with the earlier thought. Hmm, so which is it? If I consider 484 as the 49th term, then units place has 49 fours. But when I think of 488, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 49th term because it starts at 4 (1st term) and each step is +10. So, 484 is the 49th term. So, units place: 49 fours. Then, tens place: 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Hundreds place: 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, but earlier I thought 48 fours because 488/10=48.8, so 48 complete sets. But that approach might be missing the last partial set. Wait, no, because the units digit cycles every 10, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's the number of times 4 appears in the ones place, which is once every 10 numbers. So, total number is floor(488/10) + (1 if the last digit is >=4). Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, and since the last digit is 8, which is greater than or equal to 4, we add 1. So, 48 + 1 = 49. So, that's correct. So, units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total fours: 49+50=99+89=188. Now, moving on to counting the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is 488/10=48.8, so floor is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, not 10, because 488 is the last page. So, each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, contributing 10 eights each. The last set, 480-488, has 9 numbers, contributing 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, let me double-check the tens place. The sets are: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total eights: 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. Difference:188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, from 1-488, how many complete hundreds do we have? Well, 400-488 is part of the 400s. So, let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check the last set. 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can only have 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears exactly 89 times, right? Because each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book ends at 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the fours, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 49 numbers because 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Each set of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's see how many complete sets we have: 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, the first four sets give 4 \u00d7 10 = 40, and the last set gives 9. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10 +10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can only have 8 if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, does 488 count? Yes, because the units digit is 8. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, I can calculate (488 - 8)/10 +1. That's (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. Let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, total eights in the tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Let me just double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. Yes, that's correct. So, 188-98=90.

So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's fine. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.

So, in the tens place, each set contributes 10 except the last one, which contributes 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights: 98.

So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place has 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.

From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, we have 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, but let me think: each full set (like 80-89) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. The last set, 480-489, but the book only goes up to 488, so from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for that last set. So, total eights in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours: Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 0 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in units place? It's floor(488/10) + 1 if 488 is included. 488/10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 fours in units. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, 10 each: 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 fours. Total: 49 +50 +89 = 188. That seems correct. Now, eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488/10 =48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds place: 0. Total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 -98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times.

So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).

So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488.

So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, so 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188.

So that's 5 sets, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 4*10 + 9=49. That's correct. Units place for fours: from 4 to 484, which is 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Similarly for eights, units place: 8 to 488, which is 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. So, the counts seem accurate. Therefore, the difference is 90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check: from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. So, total fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188. Eights:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Each set (40-49, 140-149, etc.) has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's see how many such sets there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, does 488 count? Yes, because 488 is the last page. So, let's find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, I can calculate (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, is that correct? Let me count: 480 is the first, then up to 488, which is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 = 8, so plus 1 is 9. So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, so that's 4 x 10 = 40. The last set, 480-488, contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

There are 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (40-49). How many such blocks are there? From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 fours. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's printed is 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers. The last occurrence is 488, which is the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we include 488, it's 49 numbers. Wait, 488 is 488, so 488/10 = 48.8, but we take the integer part plus 1 if there's a remainder. Alternatively, think of it as from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place. How many blocks are there? From 1-400, there are 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, the tens place has 40 +9=49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total number of 8's printed is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's) =90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the tens place for 4's again. I thought from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 4 blocks of 100 (1-400) each have 10 fours in tens place, so 4\u00d710=40, plus 10 more in 440-449, totaling 50. Correct. For 8's in tens place, up to 488: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks, but each block except the last has 10 eights, and the last has 9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. Correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Each set of ten numbers contributes 10 occurrences. So, from 40-49: 10, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. Each number in this range has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.

The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Each set contributes 10 occurrences except the last one, which contributes 9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488).

So, total in tens place: 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. Let's calculate: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours.

Yes, because 488 is the last page. So, how many such numbers? Let's see: The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms can be found by (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Each of these sets (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers, except maybe the last one if it's cut short. Let's check: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me double-check the counts. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total: 188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total:98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Wait, from 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? Let's calculate 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, that's correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. For the tens place, in the fours: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each of those is 10 numbers, and there are 5 such sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). So, 5*10=50. That's correct. Units place: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, up to 484. So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. That's correct. So, 49 fours in units. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets is 10 numbers, and the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

So, in the first 100 pages (1-100), the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, in 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10 numbers. 300-399: 340-349, 10 numbers. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, units place: 49 fours, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. So, 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but including 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many sets. Each set contributes 10 eights in the tens place. From 0-488, how many sets? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers, not 10). So, the first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait, 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no hundreds digits of 8 in the page numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that's a big difference. Let me double-check my counts because that seems significant.\n\nWait, let me go back to the tens place for 4's. I had 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. Wait, 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each with 10 fours, so 5\u00d710=50. That seems correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place: 49 fours. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's: units place is 49, tens place is 49, hundreds place is 0. So, 98 eights.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but wait, let me check if I counted correctly in the units place for 4's. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first occurrence is 4, then 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let's see: 484 is the last one. So, how many terms? It's an arithmetic sequence starting at 4, ending at 484, with a common difference of 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place of 8's: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The last term is 488. So, ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place for 4's: as above, 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 50.\n\nIn the tens place for 8's: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4\u00d710 +9=49.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, 49 in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) = 98.\n\nSo, 4's: 188, 8's:98, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit surprised that the difference is 90. Let me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of each digit position separately and calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) + (if 488 mod 10 >=4, then 1 else 0). Wait, but 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so floor(488/10)=48, plus 1=49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in units place: same calculation, 49.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor((488)/100)*10 + min(max(488 mod 100 - 40 +1,0),10). Wait, maybe that's more complicated.\n\nWait, another way: For the tens place, the number of times 4 appears is the number of complete hundreds times 10 plus the extra in the last partial hundred.\n\nNumber of hundreds in 488 is 4 (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, actually, 488 is in the 400-488 range, which is the fifth hundred. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, for 4 hundreds (0-399), that's 4\u00d710=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 40 +10=50. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers. So, 4 hundreds: 4\u00d710=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nNumber of 8's: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). This results in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). This results in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges each contribute 10 occurrences, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8 within 1-488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, from 1-488, how many full hundreds do we have? Let's see: 1-100: 10 fours in the tens place (40-49). 101-200: another 10 (140-149). 201-300: another 10 (240-249). 301-400: another 10 (340-349). Now, 401-488: here, the tens place 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place has 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each set. From 1-100: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. 101-200: 180-189, another 10. 201-300: 280-289, another 10. 301-400: 380-389, another 10. Now, 401-488: 480-488. Here, the tens digit is 8, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 (totaling 40) plus 9 in the last partial set. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place has 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.

I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place has 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each set before 480-488 has 10 numbers. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Now, for 480-488: the tens digit is 8, and the units digits go from 0 to 8, so that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

    "text": " Each set (like 40-49) has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 fours. How many such sets are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, then 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, so we take 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, we have 49 occurrences. Wait, no: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? The sequence is 8 + 10(k-1) \u2264 488. Let me solve for k: 10(k-1) \u2264 480 \u2192 k-1 \u2264 48 \u2192 k \u2264 49. So, 49 times. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place has 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 fall within 488? Yes, up to 488. So, let's count how many sets: 80-89 is the first, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 numbers, contributing 10 eights each, and the last set (480-488) has 9 numbers, contributing 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, no: 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " Each of these sets contributes 10 numbers. So, how many such sets are there? From 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so all these are valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - This range includes 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set (480-488) contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, for 1-100, it's 10 times (40-49). Similarly, 101-200: 10 times (140-149). 201-300: 10 times (240-249). 301-400: 10 times (340-349). Now, 401-488: The tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's: 10 (from 40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449) = 50 times. Wait, but wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but does 440-449 fall within 401-488? Yes, because 440 is greater than 400 and 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10, and there are 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), but wait, 400-488 is part of the hundreds place as well. Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4 only in 400-488. So, for the tens place, in each hundred block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 0-99: 10 numbers (40-49). 100-199: 10 numbers (140-149). 200-299: 10 numbers (240-249). 300-399: 10 numbers (340-349). 400-488: 10 numbers (440-449). So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 0-99: 80-89, 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189, 10 numbers. 200-299: 280-289, 10 numbers. 300-399: 380-389, 10 numbers. 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (from 0-399) and 1 block of 9 (400-488). So, 4*10 +9=40+9=49. Wait, let me check again: 0-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, total 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, from 1-488, how many hundreds do we have? Well, 488 is less than 500, so we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500, but only up to 488). Wait, no, actually, each hundred block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, from 1-400, how many hundreds? 400 is the 4th hundred. So, 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 fours. Then, from 401-488, the tens place can also have 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's correct. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place is where the number is 4 in the hundreds digit. That would be from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the units place 8's go up to 488. So, how many such numbers? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing an 8 in the units place, plus the last number 488 itself. So, 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which might be less. From 1-400, we have 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 eights: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, adding that, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights here. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total.

Wait, but in the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 fours. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 fours. But wait, 400-499 would have 10 fours in the tens place, but our book stops at 488, so from 400-488, how many tens places have 4? Let me think. From 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 only once, from 440-449. So, that's 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, total tens place fours would be 4*10 (from 1-400) plus 10 from 400-488? Wait, no, because 400-488 includes the 440-449, which is part of the 400-499 range. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it differently. Each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, for 1-100: 10 fours (40-49). 101-200: 10 fours (140-149). 201-300: 10 fours (240-249). 301-400: 10 fours (340-349). Now, 401-488: The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours: 4*10 +10=50. Wait, that can't be right because from 1-400, it's 4 sets of 10, so 40 fours, and from 401-488, it's another 10, so total 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). Each of these contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place fours: 89. Now, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, when I counted units place, I thought 4 appears 49 times, but let me confirm. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48*1=48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 has an 8 in the units place, not a 4. So, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 fours. Tens place: Let's see, from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Each hundred has 10, so 4 hundreds would give 40, but from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so total 50. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, but the tens digit cycles 0-8, so the 4 in tens place occurs once every 100, so from 1-400, 40 fours in tens place, and from 401-488, another 10 fours, so total 50. So, tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 is included. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48*1=48. But 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 8. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let's count each hundred. From 1-100: 80-89, that's 10 eights. 101-200: 180-189, another 10. 201-300: 280-289, another 10. 301-400: 380-389, another 10. Now, 401-488: The tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 (from 1-400) +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. That seems correct. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - There are 49 such occurrences (since 484 is the 49th number).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 4 full hundreds plus the range 400-488.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.\n   - There are 89 such numbers.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - There are 49 such occurrences (including 488).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences, and from 401-488, there are 9 additional occurrences.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No 8's appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, from 1-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. From 200-299: 240-249 is 10. From 300-399: 340-349 is 10. From 400-488: 440-449 is another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, contributing 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in units? It's every 10 numbers, so total is floor(488/10)=48 full tens, but since 488 ends with 8, the last 4 in units is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So units:49. Tens place: as above, 50. Hundreds place: 89. So total fours:49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189:10. - 280-289:10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens place contributions are: 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me check the tens place again. For 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) plus 9 in 480-488: 4*10=40 +9=49. So, yes, 49 in tens place. So total eights:49+49=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours and eights. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences in the tens place. So, from 1-488, how many hundreds do we have? Well, 488 is less than 500, so we have 4 full hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but we stop at 488. So, let's see: For each hundred, the tens place has 10 fours. So, 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 fours. 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 fours. 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 fours. 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 fours. 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 fours, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's 10 fours. So, in each hundred, we have 10 fours in the tens place. How many hundreds are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set (400-488) is not a full hundred. Wait, but in the tens place, the 4's occur in 40-49, 140-149, etc., regardless of the hundreds. So, up to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the tens place is 5 times 10, but wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 fours. So, actually, it's 5 sets of 10 fours. Wait, 0-99: 10 fours. 100-199: 10 fours. 200-299: 10 fours. 300-399: 10 fours. 400-488: 10 fours (from 440-449). So that's 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 10 fours. So, total tens place fours: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, no, actually, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4. So, hundreds place fours: 89. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many 8's in the units place? The first is 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. So, how many terms? The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The difference between each term is 10, so the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place eights: 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences in the tens place. So, from 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 eights. 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 eights. 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 eights. 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 eights. 400-488: 480-488. Now, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, for 400-488, we have 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 0-399) plus 9 in 400-488. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. So, tens place eights: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, and we take the integer part plus one).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total occurrences: 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89 (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, and we take the integer part plus one).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block which contributes 9 (480-488).\n   - Total occurrences: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book only goes up to 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Hmm, but wait, 400-488: the tens place is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. Each number in this range has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so it's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the book. So, each hundred has 10 occurrences, except maybe the last one. Let's count: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 10 +10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488: the tens digit is 8, so from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers. So, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them. So, that's 9 occurrences. So, total tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place has 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98 eights. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

So, the tens digit 4 occurs once in each hundred, but in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens digit 4's: 4 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus 10 from 400-488, so total 50. Wait, but let me check: 0-99: 40-49 (10). 100-199:140-149 (10). 200-299:240-249 (10). 300-399:340-349 (10). 400-488:440-449 (10). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Therefore, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? It's an arithmetic sequence where the first term is 8, the last term is 488, and the common difference is 10. The formula for the nth term is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)*d. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 8: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n-1, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let's see how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199:180-189 (10). From 200-299:280-289 (10). From 300-399:380-389 (10). From 400-488:480-488. Wait, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 10 times in each of the first four blocks (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399), so 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484), totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n  \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488), totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
