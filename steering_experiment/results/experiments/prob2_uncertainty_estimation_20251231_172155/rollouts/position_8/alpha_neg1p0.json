    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: The only single-digit page that has a 4 is page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence of the digit 4. \n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: Here, the 4 can appear in the tens place or the units place. Let's consider each separately. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers would be 40-49. That's 10 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the tens place. So that's 10 occurrences. \n\nFor the units place: The numbers would be 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but wait, in the two-digit numbers, the units place 4's would be from 14 to 94, stepping by 10 each time. So, that's 9 numbers (14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94). But wait, in each set of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each set, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. Since there are 9 sets (10-99), that's 9 occurrences. However, wait, when I list them out, 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94, that's actually 9 numbers, right? But wait, 44 has two 4's, but I'm only counting the units place here. So, each of these contributes one 4, so that's 9. But wait, 44 is included, but in the tens place, I've already counted 40-49 as 10 occurrences. So, in the units place, it's 9, but 44 is part of both. So, in the units place, it's 9, but 44 contributes an extra 4 in the tens place, which I've already counted. So, I think that's correct. So, for two-digit numbers, the 4's in the tens place are 10, and in the units place are 9, so total of 19 occurrences. But wait, 44 is counted in both, but since we're counting each digit separately, it's okay. So, 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nWait, but let me check. From 10-99, how many 4's in the tens place? It's 10, as 40-49. For the units place, in each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, etc.), there's one 4 in the units place, so 9 groups (1-9 in the tens place), so 9 occurrences. So, total 19.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100-488. Here, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place, tens place, or units place. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit goes from 1 to 4. \n\n- For hundreds digit 1: 100-199. The 4 can appear in the tens or units place. So, how many 4's in the tens place? That's 140-149, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. Similarly, in the units place, 104,114,124,...,194. That's 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the units place. So, 10 in tens, 10 in units, total 20 for hundreds digit 1.\n\n- For hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Similarly, 4's in tens place: 240-249, 10 numbers, 10 4's. Units place: 204,214,224,...,294, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. Total 20.\n\n- For hundreds digit 3: 300-399. Same logic: 340-349 (10), and 304,314,...,394 (10). Total 20.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Now, here, the hundreds digit is 4, so every number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each contributes one 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. \n\nAdditionally, within 400-488, the tens and units places can also have 4's. So, let's calculate those.\n\nIn the tens place: Numbers like 404,414,...,484. Wait, but wait, in 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, for tens digit 4, the numbers would be 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. So, 10 4's.\n\nIn the units place: For each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, in 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see, from 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs once every 10 numbers. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. How many times does the units digit 4 occur? It would be floor((488 - 400)/10) + 1 if 488 ends with 4, but 488 ends with 8, so it's floor(88/10) +1? Wait, maybe a better way is to calculate how many complete decades are there in 400-488. From 400-409, 410-419,...,480-488. So, from 400-480, that's 9 decades (400-409, 410-419,...,480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, the last decade is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in each complete decade (like 400-409), the units digit 4 occurs once, so 9 decades would have 9 times, but wait, 400-488 is actually 89 numbers, which is 8 full decades (400-409, 410-419,...,470-479) and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in each full decade, units digit 4 occurs once, so 8 times. Then, in 480-488, does 484 occur? Yes, 484 is within 480-488, so that's one more. So, total units digit 4's in 400-488 is 8 +1 =9.\n\nWait, but let me check another way: The number of units digit 4's from 400-488 is equal to the number of times 4 appears in the units place. So, starting at 404, then 414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, in the hundreds digit 4, we have:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 (from 400-488)\n- Tens place: 10 (440-449)\n- Units place: 9 (404,414,...,484)\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers where hundreds digit is 4: 89 +10 +9= 108.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I might have made a mistake here. Because when I'm considering the hundreds digit 4, I'm including all numbers from 400-488. So, when I count the 4's in the hundreds place, it's 89. Then, in the tens place, within 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8, so 440-449 is 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. Similarly, in the units place, as we saw, 9 numbers.\n\nSo, adding up, 89 (hundreds) +10 (tens) +9 (units) =108 4's in the hundreds digit 4.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: each contributes 20, so 3*20=60\n\n- Hundreds digit 4:108\n\nSo total 4's:1+19+60+108=188.\n\nWait, let me check that again. So, single-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:\n\n- For hundreds digits 1,2,3: each 100-199,200-299,300-399, each contributes 20 4's (10 in tens,10 in units). So, 3*20=60.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4:100-488, but wait, no, hundreds digit 4 is 400-488, which we calculated as 108.\n\nSo, total 4's:1+19+60+108=188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit: The only single-digit page with an 8 is page 8, so 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: 8 can appear in the tens place or the units place.\n\nTens place: The numbers are 80-89. That's 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place, so 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: The numbers are 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. So, from 10-99, that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the units place. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nBut wait, 88 is included in both, but since we're counting each digit separately, it's fine. So, total two-digit 8's:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19.\n\nNow, three-digit numbers:100-488.\n\nAgain, hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4.\n\nFor hundreds digits 1,2,3:\n\nEach hundred (100-199,200-299,300-399) will have 8's in the tens and units places.\n\nIn each hundred, how many 8's in the tens place? The numbers are x80-x89, where x is the hundreds digit. So, for each hundred, that's 10 numbers, contributing 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, for each hundred, the numbers are x08,x18,...,x98, which is 10 numbers, contributing 10 8's in the units place. So, per hundred, 10+10=20 8's.\n\nSince there are 3 hundreds (1,2,3), that's 3*20=60 8's.\n\nNow, for hundreds digit 4:400-488.\n\nHere, the hundreds digit is 4, so let's count 8's in the tens and units places.\n\nTens place: The numbers are 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488-480+1=9 numbers. Each of these has an 8 in the tens place, so 9 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: The numbers are 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. So, from 400-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's count:\n\n408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the units place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds digit 4, 8's in the tens place:9, and in the units place:9, so total 18.\n\nAdditionally, in the hundreds digit 4, does the hundreds place ever have an 8? No, because the hundreds digit is 4, so no 8's there.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3:60\n\n- Hundreds digit 4:18\n\nSo, total 8's:60+18=78.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For hundreds digits 1,2,3, each contributes 20 8's, so 3*20=60.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4, 400-488:\n\n- Tens place:480-488, which is 9 numbers, each with 8 in tens place.\n\n- Units place:408,418,...,488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, 9+9=18.\n\nThus, total 8's:60+18=78.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any 8's in the hundreds digit 4. Since the hundreds digit is 4, there are no 8's in the hundreds place for those numbers.\n\nSo, total 8's: single-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:78.\n\nAdding up:1+19=20, plus 78=98.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, 1 (single) +19 (two-digit) +78 (three-digit) =98.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 4's as 188 and 8's as 98, so the difference would be 188-98=90.\n\nBut let me double-check the counts because 98 seems a bit low for 8's, but maybe that's correct.\n\nWait, let me recount the 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1 (page 8)\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place:80-89:10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\n- Units place:18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98:9 numbers, so 9 8's.\n\nTotal two-digit:10+9=19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3:\n\nEach contributes 10 (tens) +10 (units)=20 per hundred. So, 3*20=60.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4:\n\nTens place:480-488:9 numbers, so 9 8's.\n\nUnits place:408,418,...,488:9 numbers, so 9 8's.\n\nTotal for hundreds digit 4:18.\n\nSo, three-digit 8's:60+18=78.\n\nAdding up:1+19+78=98.\n\nSo, total 8's:98.\n\nTotal 4's:188.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the three-digit 4's. Let me check again.\n\nIn three-digit numbers, for hundreds digits 1,2,3:\n\nEach hundred contributes 20 4's, as we have 10 in tens and 10 in units.\n\nSo, 3*20=60.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4:400-488.\n\n- Hundreds place:89 numbers (400-488), each contributing a 4 in hundreds place:89.\n\n- Tens place:440-449:10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in tens place:10.\n\n- Units place:404,414,...,484:9 numbers, each contributing a 4 in units place:9.\n\nSo, 89+10+9=108.\n\nTotal 4's:60+108=168, plus single-digit 1 and two-digit 19:1+19=20, so total 4's:168+20=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:98 as above.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any 4's or 8's. For example, in the two-digit numbers, 44 has two 4's, but I counted each occurrence separately, so that's correct. Similarly, 88 has two 8's, which I counted as two separate occurrences, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the three-digit numbers, for example, 444 has three 4's, so I counted each digit separately, which is correct.\n\nSo, I think the counts are accurate.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 4, so 1 occurrence.\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 40-49 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total for two-digit: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds digits 1, 2, 3:\n       - Each contributes 10 (tens) + 10 (units) = 20 occurrences per hundred.\n       - Total for hundreds 1, 2, 3: 3 \u00d7 20 = 60.\n     - Hundreds digit 4 (400-488):\n       - Hundreds place: 89 occurrences (400-488).\n       - Tens place: 440-449 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n       - Units place: 404, 414, ..., 484 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n       - Total for hundreds digit 4: 89 + 10 + 9 = 108.\n   - **Total '4's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 60 (hundreds 1-3) + 108 (hundreds 4) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 8, so 1 occurrence.\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 80-89 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total for two-digit: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds digits 1, 2, 3:\n       - Each contributes 10 (tens) + 10 (units) = 20 occurrences per hundred.\n       - Total for hundreds 1, 2, 3: 3 \u00d7 20 = 60.\n     - Hundreds digit 4 (400-488):\n       - Tens place: 480-488 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n       - Units place: 408, 418, ..., 488 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n       - Total for hundreds digit 4: 9 + 9 = 18.\n   - **Total '8's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 60 (hundreds 1-3) + 18 (hundreds 4) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let's count the 4's in the units place. For single-digit numbers, the only 4 is on page 4. So that's 1 occurrence. For two-digit numbers, the units place cycles every 10 pages. So, from 10 to 99, every 10 pages will have a 4 in the units place. That would be 4, 14, 24, ..., 94. How many are there? Well, from 10 to 99, that's 90 numbers, so 90/10 = 9 occurrences. So, 9 more 4's in the units place for two-digit numbers. \n\nNow, for three-digit numbers, from 100 to 488. Again, the units place cycles every 10 pages. So, for each hundred, the number of 4's in the units place is 10 times per hundred. But since we're only going up to 488, let's see. From 100 to 399, that's three hundreds. Each hundred will have 10 4's in the units place, so 3*10=30. Then from 400 to 488, how many 4's in the units place? Let's see, starting at 400, the units digit cycles 400-409: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484, 494. Wait, but 494 is beyond 488, so actually, from 400 to 488, the units digit 4 occurs in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times. So, total 4's in the units place for three-digit numbers is 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39. \n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 100-199, the 4's in the units place occur at 104, 114, 124, ..., 194. That's 10 numbers. Similarly, 200-299: 204, 214, ..., 294: 10 numbers. 300-399: 304, 314, ..., 394: 10 numbers. Then 400-488: as above, 9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+9=39. Okay, that seems correct. So, total 4's in the units place: single-digit (1) + two-digit (9) + three-digit (39) = 1+9+39=49. \n\nNow, let's count the 4's in the tens place. For single-digit numbers, there are no tens place, so zero. For two-digit numbers, the tens place can be 4. So, numbers from 40-49. Each of these has a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. \n\nFor three-digit numbers, the tens place can be 4. Let's break it down. From 100-199, the tens digit is 4 in 140-149: 10 numbers. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249: 10 numbers. 300-399: 340-349: 10 numbers. 400-488: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is okay because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 10 numbers. So, total 4's in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 10+10+10+10=40. \n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place: two-digit (10) + three-digit (40) = 50. \n\nNext, let's count the 4's in the hundreds place. For single-digit and two-digit numbers, the hundreds place doesn't exist, so zero. For three-digit numbers, the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. \n\nSo, total 4's in the hundreds place: 89. \n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nWait, let me double-check that because 4's in the hundreds place from 400-488 is 89, which seems correct because 488-400+1=89. Then, tens place: 10 (two-digit) + 40 (three-digit) =50. Units place: 1 (single-digit) +9 (two-digit) +39 (three-digit)=49. So, 89+50=139, plus 49=188. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. \n\nStarting with units place. Single-digit numbers: page 8. So, 1 occurrence. \n\nTwo-digit numbers: units digit 8 occurs in 8, 18, 28, ..., 98. From 10 to 99, that's 90 numbers, so 90/10=9 occurrences. So, 9 more 8's in the units place for two-digit numbers. \n\nThree-digit numbers: units digit 8 occurs in 108,118,...,398,408,418,...,488. Wait, up to 488. Let's calculate how many. From 100-399: each hundred has 10 numbers with units digit 8, so 3 hundreds: 3*10=30. From 400-488: how many? Let's see, starting at 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers. So, total units place 8's: 30+9=39. \n\nSo, total units place 8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (9) + three-digit (39)=1+9+39=49.\n\nNow, tens place for 8. Single-digit: none. Two-digit: 80-89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. \n\nThree-digit numbers: tens digit 8. From 100-199: 180-189:10 numbers. 200-299:280-289:10 numbers. 300-399:380-389:10 numbers. 400-488:480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place 8's in three-digit numbers: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: two-digit (10) + three-digit (39)=49.\n\nNow, hundreds place for 8. In the range 1-488, the hundreds digit can be 8 only if the number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98.\n\nWait, let me verify. Units place: 1 (single-digit) +9 (two-digit) +39 (three-digit)=49. Tens place: 10 (two-digit) +39 (three-digit)=49. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. The difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the 4's and 8's.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 1 (single) +9 (two-digit) +39 (three-digit)=49\n- Tens place: 10 (two-digit) +40 (three-digit)=50\n- Hundreds place:89 (three-digit)\nTotal:49+50+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:1 (single) +9 (two-digit) +39 (three-digit)=49\n- Tens place:10 (two-digit) +39 (three-digit)=49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 188 - 98 = 90 more 4's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: from 1 to 9, the digit 4 appears once (page 4). So, that's 1 occurrence.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: from 10 to 99. Here, the digit 4 can appear in the tens place or the units place. Let's calculate each separately.\n\nFor the tens place: The numbers 40-49 each have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 occurrences (40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49).\n\nFor the units place: In every set of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. Since there are 9 sets of ten (10-99), that's 9 occurrences (14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94). Wait, but 44 was already counted in the tens place, but since we're counting each digit separately, it's okay to count it again here. So, 9 more.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nNow, for three-digit page numbers: from 100 to 488. Let's break this down further. The three-digit numbers can be split into hundreds, tens, and units places. But since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let me handle each part separately.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: For numbers 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place only in 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place: We need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers. For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, etc.), the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). There are 4 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). However, for the 400-488 range, the tens digit goes up to 8, so we need to check if the 40-49 range is included. Wait, 400-488 includes 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, except maybe the last one, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. But wait, 400-488 is part of the 400s, so in the 400s, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, for each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, except maybe the last hundred if it's cut off. But 400-488 is a full hundred? Wait, 400-499 would be a full hundred, but we only go up to 488. So, in the 400s, the tens digit 4 is present in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, each hundred contributes 10 occurrences in the tens place. Since there are 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 occurrences.\n\nWait, but let me think again. For 100-199, the tens digit 4 occurs in 140-149, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, for 200-299, it's 240-249, another 10. For 300-399, it's 340-349, another 10. For 400-488, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So yes, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40 in total.\n\nNow, the units place for three-digit numbers: Similarly, in each hundred, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so for each hundred, the digit 4 appears once every ten numbers, i.e., 10 times per hundred. So, for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488, each contributes 10 occurrences in the units place. Wait, but 400-488 is not a full hundred, so do we have 10 occurrences? Let's check. The units digit cycles from 0-9 for each ten. So, in 400-409, the units digits go from 0-9, so 404 has a 4. Similarly, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484, and 494. Wait, but 494 is beyond 488, so actually, in 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times. Wait, because 494 is 494, which is beyond 488, so it's not included. So, in 400-488, the units digit 4 appears 9 times. Therefore, for the units place:\n\n- 100-199: 10 occurrences\n- 200-299: 10\n- 300-399: 10\n- 400-488: 9\n\nSo total units digit 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought each hundred contributes 10, but in the last hundred, it's 9. So total units digit 4's are 39.\n\nSo, for three-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 40\n- Units place: 39\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check the three-digit counts.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 is correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred, 10 times, so 4 hundreds, 40. That seems correct.\n\nIn the units place, each hundred except the last has 10, and the last has 9, so 39. So, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. Then adding single and two-digit, 1 +19=20, so total 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I think I should do the same approach.\n\nSingle-digit page numbers: from 1-9, the digit 8 appears once (page 8).\n\nTwo-digit page numbers: from 10-99.\n\nTens place: numbers 80-89, each has an 8 in the tens place, so 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: in every ten numbers, the units digit 8 appears once. So, from 10-99, there are 9 sets of ten (10-19, 20-29,...90-99), so 9 occurrences (18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98). Wait, but 88 was already counted in the tens place, but we're counting digits, so it's fine to count it again.\n\nSo, two-digit 8's: 10 (tens) +9 (units)=19.\n\nThree-digit page numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 8 occurs in 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488, each hundred contributes 10 occurrences in the tens place, except the last one, 400-488. Wait, in 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 480-488. So, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...488). So, for the tens place:\n\n- 100-199: 10\n- 200-299:10\n- 300-399:10\n- 400-488:9\nTotal tens place 8's: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nUnits place: For each hundred, the units digit 8 occurs once every ten numbers. So, in each hundred, 10 occurrences. But again, for 400-488, we need to check if it's a full set. So:\n\n- 100-199: 10 (108,118,...198)\n- 200-299:10\n- 300-399:10\n- 400-488: How many? From 400-488, the units digit 8 occurs in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included.\n\nSo, units place 8's: 10 +10 +10 +9=39.\n\nTherefore, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place 39 + units place 39=78.\n\nAdding single and two-digit:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:78\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Single-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:78. So total 1+19=20, 20+78=98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds:89\n\nTens:40\n\nUnits:39\n\nTotal three-digit 4's:89+40+39=168\n\nTotal 4's:1+19+168=188\n\nFor 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19\n\nThree-digit:\n\nTens:39\n\nUnits:39\n\nTotal three-digit 8's:78\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit pages: only page 4 has a 4. So that's 1 occurrence.\n\nNext, two-digit pages: from 10 to 99. Here, 4 can appear in the tens place or the ones place. For the tens place, the numbers are 40-49. That's 10 occurrences of 4. For the ones place, the numbers are 14, 24, 34, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but 44 is already counted in the tens place, so I need to make sure I don't double count. Hmm, actually, no, when counting digits, each digit is considered separately, so 44 has two 4's. So, in the ones place, from 10-99, how many 4's are there? Well, for each ten (10-19, 20-29, etc.), there's one 4 in the ones place, except for 40-49 where it's in the tens place. So, from 10-99, the number of 4's in the ones place is 9 (since there are 9 sets of ten, but wait, actually, from 10-99, each ten has one 4 in the ones place, except 40-49 which has 10 4's in the tens place. Wait, no, I think I'm confusing. Let me clarify: in the ones place, for each ten (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), there's exactly one 4 in the ones place. Since there are 9 tens (10-99), that's 9 4's in the ones place. Plus, in the tens place, 40-49 gives 10 4's. So total 4's in two-digit numbers would be 10 (tens place) + 9 (ones place) = 19.\n\nWait, but page numbers start at 1, so single-digit is 1-9, two-digit is 10-99, and three-digit is 100-488. So, for two-digit numbers, 10-99, the 4's in the ones place are 14,24,34,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the ones place. Plus, the tens place from 40-49, which is 10 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the tens place. So, total 4's in two-digit pages: 9 + 10 = 19.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit pages: 100-488. Here, 4 can appear in the hundreds place, tens place, or ones place. Let's handle each position separately.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers: we need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens digit from 100-488. The tens digit can be 0-9, and for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9. So, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), we can count the number of times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nIn 100-199: the tens digit is 4 for 140-149, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\nSimilarly, in 200-299: 240-249, another 10 4's.\n\nIn 300-399: 340-349, another 10 4's.\n\nNow, in 400-488: the tens digit can be 0-8, but we're only interested in when it's 4. So, 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit goes up to 8. So, 440-449 is valid, so 10 4's in the tens place here.\n\nSo total 4's in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40.\n\nNow, the ones place in three-digit numbers: how many times does 4 appear in the ones place from 100-488.\n\nFor each hundred, the ones digit cycles through 0-9, so for each hundred, the number of 4's in the ones place is 10 per hundred.\n\nSo, from 100-199: 104,114,124,...,194: that's 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\nSimilarly, 200-299: 204,214,...,294: 10 4's.\n\n300-399: 304,314,...,394: 10 4's.\n\n400-488: Now, here, the ones digit goes up to 8 in 488, but since we're looking for 4's in the ones place, it's 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488, so how many 4's in the ones place here?\n\nWait, from 400-488, the ones digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, in 400-409, 404 has a 4 in the ones place.\n\nSimilarly, 410-419: 414.\n\nAnd so on, up to 480-488: 484.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the ones place from 400-488?\n\nEach ten (like 400-409, 410-419, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the ones place, except possibly the last ten if it's cut off. Since 488 is the last page, the last ten is 480-488, which includes 484, so that's one 4 in the ones place. So, how many tens are there from 400-488? 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 9 full tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488). Wait, no, 400-488 is 89 pages, which is 9 full tens (each ten being 10 pages) plus 9 pages (480-488). Wait, no, 400-488 is 89 pages, which is 9 full tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488). Wait, actually, 400-488 is 89 pages, so 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 divided by 10 is 8 full tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479) and then 9 more pages (480-488). So, in each of the 9 full tens, there's one 4 in the ones place, and in the last 9 pages (480-488), there's one more 4 in 484. So total 4's in the ones place from 400-488: 9 + 1 = 10.\n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing. Alternatively, since from 400-488, the ones digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers, so for each hundred, the number of 4's in the ones place is 10 per hundred. But since 400-488 is less than a full hundred, we have to check if it's a full set. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is 8 full tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479) and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers. In each of the 8 full tens, there's one 4 in the ones place, so 8. In 480-488, there's 484, which is one more 4. So total 8 + 1 = 9 4's in the ones place from 400-488.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Hmm, let me think again. From 400-488, how many times does the ones digit equal 4? It would be 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 4's in the ones place.\n\nSo, for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 4's (from 400-488)\n- Tens place: 40 4's (10 each from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488)\n- Ones place: 9 4's (from 400-488)\n\nWait, no, earlier I thought that in the ones place for three-digit numbers, it's 10 per hundred, but in 400-488, it's only 9. So, total ones place 4's in three-digit numbers would be:\n\nFrom 100-199: 10\nFrom 200-299: 10\nFrom 300-399: 10\nFrom 400-488: 9\nTotal: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in the tens place, it was 40, which is 10 per hundred, including 400-488. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that.\n\nFor three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 (from 400-488)\n- Tens place: 40 (10 each from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 10 from 400-488)\n- Ones place: 39 (10 each from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 9 from 400-488)\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, but let me verify that. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the number of 4's in each digit position separately across all page numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and count how many times 4 appears in each position across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nLet's start with the units place.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units digit?\n\nIn each block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 in the units place, and in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 484 is included, adding one more 4. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that seems more accurate. So, units place: 49 4's.\n\nTens place:\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, 4 appears in blocks of 100. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49 in the first hundred, 140-149 in the second, etc.).\n\nFrom 1-488, how many hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488.\n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, 4 full hundreds contribute 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nNow, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, adding 10 more.\n\nTotal tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier calculation. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again.\n\nWait, according to this method, units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's using the same method.\n\nUnits place:\n\nHow many times does 8 appear in the units digit from 1-488?\n\nSame as 4's: in each block of 10, 8 appears once. 488 /10 = 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, plus in the last partial block (481-488), 488 is included, so that's one more 8. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nIn the tens place, 8 appears in blocks of 100. Each hundred has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nFrom 1-488, we have 4 full hundreds and a partial hundred.\n\nEach full hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nIn the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes up to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but in terms of the tens digit, 480-488 is the tens digit 8, so that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it's 10, but since 488 is the last page, it's only up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place in the partial hundred.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nIn the hundreds place, 8 appears in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal: 188\n\n8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:98\n\nDifference:188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, but earlier when I was thinking about two-digit numbers, I had 19 4's, and three-digit numbers adding up to 168, but that approach might have been flawed. The digit-by-digit approach seems more accurate because it systematically counts each digit position across all numbers.\n\nWait, let me cross-verify with another method. Let's consider each digit position separately.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\nIn 1-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, the number of times each digit appears in the units place is roughly 488 / 10 = 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, it's 48 full cycles (1-480) and then 481-488.\n\nIn each full cycle (10 numbers), each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, in 480 numbers, each digit appears 48 times. Then, in 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so digits 1-8 appear once more, and 9 doesn't. So, for units place:\n\n- Digits 0: 48 times\n- Digits 1-8: 48 + 1 = 49 times\n- Digits 9: 48 times\n\nSo, units place: 49 times for 4 and 8.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\nIn 1-488, the tens digit cycles 0-9 every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 full hundreds (1-400), each digit appears 4 * 10 = 40 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, in 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each ten in 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8. So, for the tens digit 8, it appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nThus, total tens place:\n\n- For digits 0-7: 40 times each\n- For digit 8: 40 + 9 = 49 times\n- For digit 9: 40 times (but in 401-488, digit 9 doesn't appear in the tens place, so actually, digit 9 in tens place would only be in 490-499, which is beyond 488, so digit 9 appears 40 times in the tens place from 1-400, and 0 times in 401-488, so total 40.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in the tens place, 8 appears 49 times, which matches this.\n\nSo, for the tens place, 4 appears 40 times in the tens place from 1-400, and in 401-488, does 4 appear in the tens place? Yes, in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 more, making total 50 times for 4 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but in the earlier digit-by-digit approach, I had 50 4's in the tens place, which aligns with this. So, 4 appears 50 times in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8, in the tens place, from 1-400, it's 40 times, and in 401-488, it's 9 times, so total 49 times.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-488, the hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place (from 400-488). Digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all, so 0 times.\n\nSo, summing up:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99; 99+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** In each block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 full blocks (1-480) and one partial block (481-488), contributing an additional 4. Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, 8 appears once per block of 10. Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Four full hundreds (1-400) give 40. The partial hundred (401-488) includes 440-449, adding 10. Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - **8's:** Each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Four full hundreds give 40. The partial hundred (401-488) includes 480-488, adding 9. Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** From 400-488, 4 appears 89 times.\n   - **8's:** Does not appear in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: from 1 to 9, the digit 4 appears once, which is page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence. \n\nNext, two-digit numbers: from 10 to 99. Here, the digit 4 can appear in the tens place or the units place. Let me calculate each separately. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers are 40-49. That's 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place. So, that's 10 occurrences. \n\nFor the units place: The numbers are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but wait, 44 has two 4's, so I need to make sure I don't double count. But when counting occurrences, each digit is counted separately, so 44 contributes two 4's. So, from 10 to 99, how many 4's in the units place? Let's see, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 10 to 99, there are 9 sets of 10, but actually, from 10 to 99, it's 90 numbers, so 9 times 10. Wait, no, actually, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so for each ten's place, there's one 4 in the units place. So, from 10 to 99, there are 9 tens (10-19, 20-29,...90-99), and in each of these, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 9 occurrences. But wait, in the 40-49 range, the units digit 4 also appears in 44, which we've already counted in the tens place. Wait, no, when counting units digits, it's separate from the tens digits. So, in the tens place, we have 10 occurrences (40-49), and in the units place, from 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94, that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place, except 44 which contributes two 4's, but when counting units digits, it's just one per occurrence. Wait, no, actually, for each units digit, regardless of the tens digit, it's one per ten numbers. So, from 10 to 99, there are 9 occurrences of 4 in the units place (14,24,...94). So, total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. \n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 10 to 99, for the tens place, 40-49: 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place, so 10. For the units place, in each ten's group (10-19, 20-29,...90-99), the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 9 times (since there are 9 ten's groups). So, total 10 + 9 = 19. So, in two-digit numbers, 19 4's.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers: from 100 to 488. Here, the digit 4 can appear in the hundreds, tens, or units place. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: From 100 to 399, the hundreds digit is 1,2,3, so no 4's here. Then from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, so every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place: We need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488. Let's consider each hundred group separately.\n\nFrom 100-199: The tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in 100-199, the tens digit is 4 in the range 140-149. That's 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. So, 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 200-299: Similarly, the tens digit is 4 in 240-249, another 10 numbers. So, another 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 300-399: Tens digit 4 in 340-349, 10 numbers, so another 10.\n\nFrom 400-488: Tens digit 4 in 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 occurrences.\n\nWait, but let me check: From 100-199: 140-149 is 10 numbers. 200-299: 240-249, 10. 300-399: 340-349, 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers (440 to 449 inclusive). So, yes, 40 in total.\n\nNow, the units place: How many times does 4 appear in the units place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nAgain, let's break it down by hundreds.\n\nFrom 100-199: The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each ten's group, the units digit 4 appears once. There are 10 ten's groups (0-9), so 10 occurrences. So, 10.\n\nFrom 200-299: Similarly, 10 occurrences in the units place.\n\nFrom 300-399: 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 400-488: Now, the units digit 4 appears once every ten numbers. How many ten's groups are there? From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419),..., up to 8 (480-488). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last ten's group is 80-88, but only up to 488. So, how many ten's groups are there? Let's see: 400-409 (tens=0), 410-419 (tens=1), ..., 480-488 (tens=8). So, that's 9 ten's groups. In each of these, the units digit 4 appears once, except for the last group, 480-488, which only goes up to 488, so does it include 484? Yes, because 484 is within 480-488. So, in each ten's group, units digit 4 appears once. So, that's 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but let me check: From 400-409: 404 is included, so that's one. 410-419: 414, one. Similarly, up to 480-488: 484 is included, so that's one. So, total 9 occurrences in 400-488.\n\nSo, total units digit 4's in three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 100-199: 10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place 89, tens place 40, units place 39. So, total 89+40+39=168.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) = 129, plus 39 (units) is 168. So, total 4's from 100-488 is 168.\n\nNow, let's add the single-digit and two-digit 4's. Single-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:168. So total 4's:1+19=20, plus 168=188.\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, 1 (single) +19 (two-digit) =20, plus 168 (three-digit) =188. Hmm, that seems high, but let me check.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the three-digit count. Let me go through it again.\n\nThree-digit numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nTens place: 100-199: 140-149:10, 200-299:240-249:10, 300-399:340-349:10, 400-488:440-449:10. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10, making total tens place 40.\n\nUnits place: 100-199: 10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: single-digit 1, two-digit 19, three-digit 168. 1+19=20, 20+168=188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with single-digit: from 1-9, the digit 8 appears once, which is page 8. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: from 10-99.\n\nTens place: The numbers are 80-89. That's 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place, so 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: The numbers are 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. So, that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the units place. However, 88 has two 8's, but when counting units digits, it's just one per occurrence. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: from 10-99, the units digit 8 appears once in each ten's group. There are 9 ten's groups (10-19, ...,90-99), so 9 occurrences. So, total 8's in two-digit numbers: tens place 10, units place 9, total 19.\n\nNow, three-digit numbers: from 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1,2,3,4. So, 4's hundreds digit is 4, but 8's hundreds digit is 8, which is beyond 488, so no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers.\n\nFrom 100-199: The tens digit is 8 in 180-189, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 200-299: Tens digit 8 in 280-289:10.\n\nFrom 300-399: Tens digit 8 in 380-389:10.\n\nFrom 400-488: Tens digit 8 in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is a partial group. The tens digit is 8, so the numbers are 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 -480 +1=9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 (100-199) +10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+9 (400-488)=39.\n\nUnits place: Now, how many times does 8 appear in the units place across all three-digit numbers.\n\nFrom 100-199: The units digit 8 appears once in each ten's group, so 10 occurrences (108,118,...,198).\n\nFrom 200-299: Similarly, 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 300-399:10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 400-488: The units digit 8 appears once in each ten's group. How many ten's groups are there? From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8 (400-409, 410-419,...,480-488). So, 9 ten's groups. In each, units digit 8 appears once, except for the last group, 480-488, which includes 488. So, that's 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but let me check: From 400-409: 408 is included. 410-419:418, etc., up to 480-488:488. So, yes, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total units place 8's:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place 39, units place 39, total 78.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's: single-digit 1, two-digit 19, three-digit 78. So, 1+19=20, 20+78=98.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, single-digit 1, two-digit 19, three-digit 78, so total 1+19=20, 20+78=98. Hmm, but let me check again.\n\nWait, in three-digit numbers, tens place 39, units place 39, so 78. So, 78 in three-digit, plus two-digit 19, plus single-digit 1, total 98.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the three-digit tens place count for 8's. Let me go through it again.\n\nFrom 100-199: tens digit 8 is 180-189, which is 10 numbers, so 10.\n\n200-299:280-289, 10.\n\n300-399:380-389, 10.\n\n400-488:480-488, which is 9 numbers because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nUnits place: same as before, 39.\n\nSo, 39+39=78 in three-digit numbers.\n\nSo, total 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nWait, but let me check: single-digit 8's:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:78, so 1+19=20, 20+78=98.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, total 8's:98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but wait, let me confirm again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, 4's:188, 8's:98, so 188-98=90.\n\nBut let me check if I counted correctly.\n\nWait, for 4's, single-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:168, total 188.\n\nFor 8's, single-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:78, total 98.\n\nYes, so 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the three-digit 4's count. Let me check that again.\n\nThree-digit 4's: hundreds place 89, tens place 40, units place 39. 89+40=129, 129+39=168. So, 168 in three-digit.\n\nSo, 168+19+1=188.\n\nAnd for 8's, 78+19+1=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to miss something. Let me think of another way to count, maybe using digit positions.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider each digit position separately: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIn each block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-488, there are 48 full blocks of 10 (since 488/10=48.8). So, 48 times, plus the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), which include 484, so that's one more. So, total 49.\n\nWait, but wait, that's a different approach. Let me see.\n\nWait, but earlier I counted 39 in three-digit units place, plus 9 in two-digit units place, plus 1 in single-digit, which is 39+9+1=49. So, that matches. So, units place 4's:49.\n\nTens place: how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn each block of 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n\nFrom 1-488, how many hundreds blocks?\n\nFrom 1-99: 10 (40-49).\n\nFrom 100-199:10 (140-149).\n\nFrom 200-299:10 (240-249).\n\nFrom 300-399:10 (340-349).\n\nFrom 400-488:10 (440-449).\n\nWait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so 440-449 is within that, so 10 numbers.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's:10+10+10+10+10=50.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 40 in three-digit numbers. Wait, no, in my initial count, I had 40 in three-digit, but now this approach is giving me 50. Hmm, that's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, in my initial count, I had:\n\nSingle-digit:1 (no tens place).\n\nTwo-digit:10 in tens place.\n\nThree-digit:40 in tens place.\n\nSo, total 10 (two-digit) +40=50.\n\nWait, but in my initial breakdown, I had two-digit tens place as 10, three-digit tens place as 40, so total 50.\n\nBut earlier, I thought the three-digit tens place was 40, which is correct because 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:10, so 40.\n\nSo, yes, total tens place 4's:50.\n\nWait, but in the alternative approach, I thought of 50.\n\nSimilarly, hundreds place 4's: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nSo, total 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Wait, but that's 49+50=99, plus 89=188. Yes, that matches.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place: same approach. In each block of 10, 8 appears once. From 1-488, how many full blocks of 10? 48, and in the last partial block (481-488), 8 appears once (488). So, 48+1=49.\n\nTens place: in each block of 100, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89). From 1-488, how many blocks of 100? 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. So, total tens place 8's:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 8's in hundreds place would be from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. So, 49+49=98.\n\nSo, that matches my earlier count.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. Difference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: From 1 to 9, the only page number that has a 4 is page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence of the digit 4.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers: These range from 10 to 99. I can think of each two-digit number as having a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place.\n\nFor the tens place: The numbers 40-49 all have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 occurrences (40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49).\n\nFor the units place: The 4 can appear in the units place for numbers like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but since we're only going up to 99, that's correct. Let me count them: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences of 4 in the units place.\n\nWait, but page 44 has two 4's, so I think I might be double-counting there. Hmm, no, actually, when counting the number of times the digit appears, each occurrence is counted separately. So, in 44, there are two 4's, so that's two separate counts. So, in the units place, 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94: that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place, except for 44, which contributes an extra 4 in the tens place, which I've already counted earlier. Wait, no, I think I'm confusing myself. Let me clarify: When I'm counting the units place, I'm only looking at the units digit, so 14 has a 4 in the units place, 24 as well, and so on. So, 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94: that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, that's 9 occurrences. But 44 also has a 4 in the tens place, which I've already counted as 10 occurrences in the tens place. So, in total, for two-digit numbers, the number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 occurrences.\n\nWait, but let me check: From 10 to 99, the number of 4's in the tens place is 10 (40-49), and in the units place, it's 9 (14,24,...,94). So, total 19.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: These are from 100 to 488. Again, each number has hundreds, tens, and units places. I'll need to count the number of 4's in each place.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: From 100 to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in 400-488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place: I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in 100-199, the tens digit is 4 for 140-149: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, in 200-299, it's 240-249: another 10. In 300-399, it's 340-349: another 10. Now, in 400-488, the tens digit can go up to 8, so 440-449 is another 10, but wait, 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit in 400-488 can be 0-8. So, for the tens digit being 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in total, for the tens place, we have 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-449) = 40 occurrences. Wait, but wait, 400-488 includes up to 488, so 440-449 is within that range, so yes, 10 numbers. So, total 40.\n\nNow, the units place: Similarly, for each hundred, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in 100-199, the units digit is 4 for 104,114,124,...,194: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, in 200-299, it's 204,214,...,294: another 10. In 300-399, it's 304,314,...,394: another 10. In 400-488, the units digit is 4 for 404,414,...,484. Let me check how many that is. From 404 to 484, stepping by 10: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. Wait, 404 is the first, then adding 10 each time: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers. So, in 400-488, the units digit 4 appears 9 times. So, total for units place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 occurrences.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: From 100-199, 104,114,...,194: that's 10 numbers because 100 + 4 = 104, and 199 - 104 = 95, so 95/10 = 9.5, but since we start at 104, the count is 10: 104,114,124,134,144,154,164,174,184,194. Yes, 10 numbers. Similarly for 200-299 and 300-399. For 400-488, starting at 404, each step of 10, up to 484. Let me count: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 + 10 would be 494, which is beyond 488. So, yes, 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total number of 4's in three-digit numbers is hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89 + 40 = 129 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again: From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 168\n\nTotal 4's = 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) = 20. 20 + 168 = 188. Hmm, maybe, but let me check the three-digit counts again.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTens place: For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds, and in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: 10 in each of the first three hundreds, and 9 in 400-488, so 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. Correct.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. So, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: From 1 to 9, the only page number with an 8 is page 8. So, that's 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers: Again, tens and units places.\n\nTens place: The numbers 80-89 have 8 in the tens place, so that's 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: The 8 can appear in the units place for numbers like 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but page 88 has two 8's, so does that affect the count? No, because when counting occurrences, each digit is counted separately. So, 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98: that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nNow, three-digit page numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1,2,3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place in three-digit numbers up to 488, because the hundreds digit only goes up to 4. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9. So, in 100-199, the tens digit is 8 for 180-189: 10 numbers. Similarly, in 200-299, it's 280-289: another 10. In 300-399, it's 380-389: another 10. In 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 is the last page. So, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, total in tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nUnits place: Similarly, for each hundred, the units digit is 8 for 108,118,...,198: 10 numbers. In 200-299, it's 208,218,...,298: another 10. In 300-399, it's 308,318,...,398: another 10. In 400-488, the units digit is 8 for 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Let me count: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers. So, total in units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but let me check: In 400-488, the units digit 8 occurs at 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included, so yes, 9.\n\nSo, total number of 8's in three-digit numbers is tens place (39) + units place (39) = 78.\n\nAdding up all the 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 78\n\nTotal 8's = 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me check again.\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 8)\n\nTwo-digit: 10 (80-89) + 9 (18,28,...,98) = 19\n\nThree-digit: Tens place 39 + units place 39 = 78\n\nSo, total 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 4)\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place: 40-49 \u2192 10\n- Units place: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94 \u2192 9\nTotal: 10 + 9 = 19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 \u2192 89\n- Tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-449) \u2192 40\n- Units place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) \u2192 39\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\n8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 8)\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place: 80-89 \u2192 10\n- Units place: 18,28,...,98 \u2192 9\nTotal: 10 + 9 = 19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) \u2192 39\n- Units place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) \u2192 39\nTotal: 39 + 39 = 78\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again: Did I count the three-digit numbers correctly? For the units place in three-digit numbers, in 400-488, I counted 9 occurrences of 8 in the units place. Is that correct? Let me list them: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Yes, that's 9 numbers. So, 9 is correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for 400-488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place for 4's, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. That seems right.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 4 \u2192 1 occurrence.\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 40-49 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total for two-digit: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n     - Tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-449) \u2192 40.\n     - Units place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) \u2192 39.\n     - Total for three-digit: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n   - **Total '4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 8 \u2192 1 occurrence.\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 80-89 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total for two-digit: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: 0 occurrences (since hundreds digit only goes up to 4).\n     - Tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) \u2192 39.\n     - Units place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) \u2192 39.\n     - Total for three-digit: 39 + 39 = 78.\n   - **Total '8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.  \n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: the only single-digit page with a 4 is page 4 itself. So, that's one 4. Now, moving on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. In two-digit numbers, the 4 can appear either in the tens place or the ones place. Let me calculate each separately.\n\nFor the tens place: The numbers 40-49 each have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of the digit 4. \n\nFor the ones place: The numbers 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94 each have a 4 in the ones place. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, so I should count both. However, when I'm counting digits, each occurrence is counted separately. So, in the ones place, every 10 numbers, there's one 4. So from 10 to 99, there are 9 sets of 10, but actually, from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers, so 90 / 10 = 9 occurrences of 4 in the ones place. But wait, 44 is included in both the tens and ones place counts, but that's okay because each digit is counted separately. So, for two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (ones place) = 19. But wait, 44 has two 4's, so that would actually be 10 + 9 + 1 (the extra 4 in 44). Hmm, no, I think my initial count is correct because when I count the tens place, 44 is included as one of the 10, and when I count the ones place, 44 is included as one of the 9. So, 10 + 9 = 19, but 44 contributes two 4's, so the total should be 19 +1? Wait, no, because in the tens place, 44 is counted once, and in the ones place, it's counted once, so together, it's two 4's. So, my initial count of 10 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 19 is correct because each digit is counted separately. So, for two-digit numbers, 19 4's.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Let's break this down into hundreds, tens, and ones places.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, for hundreds place, how many times does 4 appear? It's from 400 to 488. So, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place: Here, we need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens digit across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488. Let's consider each hundred separately.\n\n- For hundreds digit 1: The tens digit can be 0-9, so 140-149 would have 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n- Similarly, for hundreds digit 2: 240-249, another 10 4's.\n- For hundreds digit 3: 340-349, another 10 4's.\n- For hundreds digit 4: Now, this is a bit tricky because the book ends at 488. So, the tens digit can be 0-8, since 488 is the last page. So, the 4 in the tens place would be in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's 10 4's.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total for tens place is 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 10 (hundreds 4) = 40 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the ones place: Here, we count how many times 4 appears in the ones digit across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488. Again, let's break it down by hundreds.\n\n- For hundreds digit 1: The ones digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in 100-199, the ones digit is 4 in 104, 114, 124, ..., 194. That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n- Similarly, for hundreds digit 2: 204, 214, ..., 294. Another 10.\n- For hundreds digit 3: 304, 314, ..., 394. Another 10.\n- For hundreds digit 4: Now, the ones digit 4 can occur in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, but 484 is within 488, so that's 9 numbers because from 400-488, the ones digit 4 occurs every 10 numbers starting at 404, up to 484. Let me count: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 4's.\n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 90 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Hmm, but for the ones place, in each hundred, it's 10 occurrences, except for the last hundred, which might be cut off. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the ones digit 4 occurs how many times? Let me think differently. From 400 to 488, the ones digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the ones place is the number of complete decades plus any extra. Since 88 is the last number, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is 8 full decades (400-479) and 9 numbers (480-488). In each decade, 4 appears once in the ones place, so 8 times. Then, in 480-488, the ones digit goes from 0-8, so 4 doesn't appear in the ones place here. So, total ones place 4's in hundreds digit 4 is 8. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 9, but that was incorrect because 484 is within 488, but 484 is the 8th occurrence in the 400-488 range. Wait, let me recount. From 400-488, the ones digit 4 occurs at 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 times. Wait, but 484 is 484, which is within 488, so yes, it's included. So, that's 9 times. So, perhaps my initial count was correct. So, hundreds digit 4 contributes 9 4's in the ones place.\n\nSo, total ones place 4's: 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 9 (hundreds 4) = 39.\n\nWait, but let me check: For hundreds digit 1, 100-199: 104,114,...,194: 10 numbers. Similarly for 200-299 and 300-399: each has 10. For 400-488: 404,414,...,484: that's 9 numbers because 484 is the 9th occurrence. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total ones place 4's: 39.\n\nSo, for three-digit numbers, total 4's are hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + ones place (39) = 89+40=129+39=168.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Hundreds place: 89, tens place:40, ones place:39. So, 89+40=129, 129+39=168. So, total 4's in three-digit numbers:168.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1+19=20+168=188.\n\nWait, but wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the three-digit counts.\n\nWait, let's recount the three-digit numbers more carefully.\n\nFirst, hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's.\n\nTens place: For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit is 4 in the range 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, each of the first three hundreds contributes 10 4's in the tens place, and the fourth hundred contributes 10 4's as well, because 440-449 is within 488. So, 10+10+10+10=40. So, that's correct.\n\nOnes place: For each hundred, the ones digit 4 occurs once every 10 numbers. So, for 100-199: 104,114,...,194: 10 times. Similarly, 200-299: 10 times. 300-399:10 times. For 400-488: The ones digit 4 occurs at 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 times because 484 is the last one before 488. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168. So, 168 4's in three-digit numbers.\n\nAdding single-digit (1) and two-digit (19): 1+19=20. 20+168=188. So, total 4's:188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process.\n\nSingle-digit page numbers: The only single-digit 8 is page 8 itself. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers: 8 can appear in the tens or ones place.\n\nTens place: 80-89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\nOnes place: The numbers 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 8's. But wait, 88 has two 8's, so when counting digits, that's two 8's. So, in the ones place, we have 9 numbers, each contributing one 8, except 88, which contributes two. So, total ones place 8's: 9 +1=10? Wait, no, because in the ones place, every 10 numbers, there's one 8, so from 10-99, that's 9 sets of 10, each contributing one 8 in the ones place. But 88 is in the 80-89 range, which we've already counted in the tens place. Wait, no, when counting the ones place, we're looking at the ones digit being 8, regardless of the tens digit. So, from 10-99, the numbers ending with 8 are 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the ones place. However, 88 has two 8's, so that's one extra 8. So, total ones place 8's: 9 +1=10. Wait, but that's not correct because 88 is only counted once in the ones place. Wait, no, when you count the ones place, you count each occurrence of 8 in the ones digit, regardless of the tens digit. So, 18 has one 8, 28 has one, etc., up to 98. So, that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the ones place. But 88 has an 8 in both tens and ones place. So, in the tens place, we've already counted 10 8's from 80-89, which includes 88. So, in the ones place, we have 9 numbers ending with 8, each contributing one 8, but 88 is already included in the tens place count. So, does that mean we should only count 9 ones place 8's? Or do we count 9 and include the extra 8 from 88? Wait, no, because when counting digits, each digit is counted separately. So, in the tens place, 88 contributes one 8, and in the ones place, it contributes another 8. So, the total number of 8's in two-digit numbers is 10 (tens) +9 (ones) =19. Wait, but that would double-count the 8's in 88. Wait, no, because in the tens place, we're counting all 8's in the tens digit, which includes 88, and in the ones place, we're counting all 8's in the ones digit, which includes 88 again. So, total 8's in two-digit numbers would be 10 (tens) +9 (ones) =19, but 88 is counted twice, once in each. So, the total number of 8's is 19, but the actual count is 19 digits, not numbers. So, that's correct because each digit is counted separately.\n\nWait, but let me think again. For two-digit numbers, the total number of 8's in the tens place is 10 (80-89), and in the ones place, it's 9 (18,28,...,98). So, total 10+9=19 8's in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, from 100 to 488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: Now, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens digit across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nFor each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit is 8 in the ranges 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488.\n\nSo, let's calculate each:\n\n- 100-199: 180-189. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n- 200-299: 280-289. Another 10.\n- 300-399: 380-389. Another 10.\n- 400-488: 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nOnes place: Now, count how many times 8 appears in the ones digit across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nAgain, let's break it down by hundreds.\n\n- 100-199: The ones digit is 8 in 108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n- 200-299: 208,218,...,298. Another 10.\n- 300-399: 308,318,...,398. Another 10.\n- 400-488: The ones digit 8 occurs in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, as 488 is included.\n\nSo, total ones place 8's:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, for three-digit numbers, total 8's are tens place (39) + ones place (39) =78.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) =1+19=20+78=98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the three-digit counts because I might have made a mistake.\n\nTens place in three-digit numbers: For each hundred, 180-189, etc., contributing 10 each for the first three hundreds, and 9 for the last. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nOnes place: Each hundred contributes 10, except the last, which contributes 9. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, 39+39=78. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's:1 (single-digit) +19 (two-digit) +78 (three-digit) =98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought two-digit 8's were 19, which includes 10 in tens and 9 in ones, but when I recount, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me check two-digit 8's again.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: 80-89:10 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the tens place. So, 10 8's.\n\nOnes place: numbers ending with 8:18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the ones place. So, 9 8's.\n\nBut 88 has two 8's, so in the tens place, we've counted one 8, and in the ones place, another. So, total 8's in two-digit numbers:10+9=19, which is correct because each digit is counted separately.\n\nSo, total 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's:188, total 8's:98.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the three-digit counts. Let me recount the three-digit 4's and 8's.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Hundreds place:400-488:89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n- Tens place:140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449:10 each, so 40.\n- Ones place:104,114,...,194 (10), 204,...,294 (10), 304,...,394 (10), 404,...,484 (9). So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nTotal 4's:89+40+39=168. Then, single-digit and two-digit:1+19=20. Total 4's:168+20=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Hundreds place:0, since the book doesn't reach 800.\n- Tens place:180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488:10,10,10,9=39.\n- Ones place:108,118,...,198 (10), 208,...,298 (10), 308,...,398 (10), 408,...,488 (9). So,10+10+10+9=39.\n\nTotal 8's:39+39=78. Then, single-digit and two-digit:1+19=20. Total 8's:78+20=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly for three-digit numbers. For example, in the tens place for 4's, I had 10 for each hundred, including 440-449, which is correct because 449 is within 488. Similarly, for ones place, 484 is included.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. In the ones place, 488 is included, so that's 9 numbers.\n\nSo, I think my counts are correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers, the only 4 is on page 4. So that's one 4. Now, moving on to two-digit numbers, which range from 10 to 99. In two-digit numbers, the 4 can appear in the tens place or the units place. Let's calculate each separately. \n\nFor the tens place, the numbers are 40-49. That's 10 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the tens place. So that's 10 4's. \n\nFor the units place, the 4 appears once every ten numbers, like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, but since we're counting each occurrence, it's still 10 times in total because each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, etc.) has one 4 in the units place. So that's another 9 4's because from 10-99, there are 9 sets of ten, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Wait, but 40-49 is already counted in the tens place, so maybe it's 9 times? Hmm, no, actually, in the units place, 44 is included, so from 10-99, the units digit 4 occurs 9 times (14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94). So that's 9 4's in the units place for two-digit numbers. \n\nWait, but 40-49 is 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place, and then in the units place, from 10-99, excluding 40-49, we have 9 numbers where 4 is in the units place. So total 4's in two-digit numbers would be 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 4's. \n\nWait, but when I count 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94, that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So yes, 9 4's there. So total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 + 9 = 19. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Let's break this down by hundreds, tens, and units places. \n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\nFor the hundreds digit being 4, the numbers are 400-488. So, how many 4's are in the hundreds place here? Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89), each contributing one 4. So that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. \n\nNow, let's consider the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9, and the units digit can be 0-9. We need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers up to 488. \n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, and 4, the tens digit can be 0-9. So for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), we need to count the number of times 4 appears in the tens place. \n\nFor hundreds 1, 2, 3: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). Each of these contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So for hundreds 1, 2, 3, that's 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 4's in the tens place. \n\nNow, for hundreds 4 (400-488), the tens digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the last number). So the tens digit 4 in 400-488 would be in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. So that's another 10 4's in the tens place for hundreds 4. \n\nWait, but 488 is the last number, so 440-449 is within 400-488. So yes, 10 4's in the tens place for hundreds 4. So total tens place 4's in three-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 40 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, considering hundreds 1, 2, 3, and 4. For each hundred, the units digit cycles from 0-9, so in each hundred, the digit 4 appears once every ten numbers, i.e., 10 times per hundred. \n\nSo for hundreds 1, 2, 3: Each contributes 10 4's in the units place, so 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 4's. \n\nFor hundreds 4 (400-488), the units digit can be 0-8, but since we're counting up to 488, we need to check how many times 4 appears in the units place. From 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten, but since 488 is the last, we have complete sets from 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. \n\nWait, 488 is 488, so the units digits go up to 8. So how many times does 4 appear in the units place from 400-488? Let's see: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the units place. So 9 4's in the units place for hundreds 4. \n\nWait, but actually, from 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten, but since 488 is the last number, the last ten is 480-488, which ends at 8. So how many complete tens are there? From 400-480 is 8 tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488). Wait, no, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so that's 8 full tens (each 10 numbers) and then 9 more numbers (480-488). Wait, maybe a better way is to calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place in 400-488. \n\nEach ten's group (e.g., 400-409) has exactly one 4 in the units place (404). So from 400-480, which is 80 numbers (8 tens), there are 8 instances where the units digit is 4 (404, 414, ..., 474). Then, from 480-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So total 8 + 1 = 9 4's in the units place for hundreds 4. \n\nSo total units place 4's in three-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39 4's in the units place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89 + 40 = 129 + 39 = 168 4's.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Hundreds place: 89 4's, tens place: 40 4's, units place: 39 4's. So 89 + 40 = 129, plus 39 is 168. So total 4's in three-digit numbers: 168.\n\nNow, adding up all 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1 + 19 = 20 + 168 = 188 4's in total.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the two-digit numbers. Earlier, I thought it was 19 4's, but let me recount. From 10-99:\n\n- Tens place: 40-49: 10 4's.\n- Units place: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94: that's 9 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the units place. So 9 4's.\n- Total: 10 + 9 = 19 4's in two-digit numbers. So that's correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's. I need to count how many times 8 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nStarting with single-digit numbers: only page 8, so that's one 8.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: 10-99. Let's count the 8's in tens and units places.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89: 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So 10 8's.\n- Units place: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the units place. So 9 8's.\n- Total in two-digit numbers: 10 + 9 = 19 8's.\n\nNow, three-digit numbers: 100-488. Let's break this down by hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\n- For hundreds 1, 2, 3: Each hundred has numbers where the hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3. So in the hundreds place, 8 doesn't appear here because the hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3. So no 8's in the hundreds place for these hundreds.\n- For hundreds 4: The hundreds digit is 4, so no 8's here either. So total 8's in hundreds place for three-digit numbers: 0.\n\nTens place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- For hundreds 1, 2, 3: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, 380-389). Each of these contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 8's.\n- For hundreds 4: The tens digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the last number). So the tens digit 8 in 400-488 occurs in 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but actually, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. But wait, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, so that's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So that's 9 8's in the tens place for hundreds 4.\n- So total tens place 8's in three-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39 8's.\n\nUnits place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- For hundreds 1, 2, 3: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the units digit is 8 (e.g., 108, 118, ..., 198; same for 200s and 300s). So 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 8's.\n- For hundreds 4: The units digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the last number). So in 400-488, the units digit 8 appears in 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the units place.\n- So total units place 8's in three-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39 8's.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place (39) + units place (39) = 78 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check: hundreds place 0, tens place 39, units place 39. So total 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 8's in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, total 8's in the entire book: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) = 1 + 19 = 20 + 78 = 98 8's.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, for hundreds 4, in the tens place, we had 480-488, which is 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So that's 9 8's. Similarly, in the units place, from 400-488, the units digit 8 appears in 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the units place for hundreds 4. So yes, 9 + 9 = 18 8's in three-digit numbers for hundreds 4. \n\nWait, but earlier I had 30 (tens) + 39 (units) = 69, but that seems conflicting. Wait no, I think I made a mistake in adding. Let me recast:\n\nIn three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0 8's.\n- Tens place: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39 8's.\n- Units place: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39 8's.\n- So total 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 8's in three-digit numbers.\n\nYes, that's correct. So total 8's: 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98 8's.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the units place for three-digit numbers. Let me recount the units place for hundreds 4. From 400-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So yes, 30 (from 100-399) + 9 = 39 8's in units place.\n\nSo total 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify this because 188 - 98 is indeed 90, but I want to make sure I didn't overcount or undercount somewhere.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1 (page 4)\n- Two-digit: 19 (10 in tens place, 9 in units place)\n- Three-digit: 168 (89 in hundreds, 40 in tens, 39 in units)\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nAnd for 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1 (page 8)\n- Two-digit: 19 (10 in tens place, 9 in units place)\n- Three-digit: 78 (39 in tens, 39 in units)\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9), the digit 4 appears once, which is on page 4. So, that's one 4. Now, moving on to two-digit numbers (10-99). Here, I can think of each two-digit number as having a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. \n\nFor the tens place, the numbers from 40 to 49 each have a 4 in the tens digit. That's 10 numbers, so that's 10 fours. For the units place, the numbers ending with 4 in the two-digit range are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, and 94. Wait, but since we're only going up to 99, 94 is included. So that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 44 has two 4's, so I need to make sure I'm counting correctly. So, for the units place, from 10 to 99, every 10 numbers, there's one number ending with 4. So that's 9 occurrences (14,24,...,94). But wait, 44 is included in both the tens and units counts. So, in total, for two-digit numbers, the number of 4's is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. But wait, 44 has two 4's, so actually, each occurrence in the tens and units place adds up. So, 10 in tens, 9 in units, but 44 is counted twice, so total 19. So, 19 fours in two-digit numbers. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Here, each number has hundreds, tens, and units places. Let's start by considering the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, but when it's 4, the tens and units digits are limited because 488 is the maximum. \n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in the hundreds place. That's all the numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. \n\nNext, let's count the number of 4's in the tens place for three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0 to 9, but we're looking for when it's 4. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in the 100-199 range, the tens digit is 4 for 140-149, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 200-299, it's 240-249, another 10. In 300-399, it's 340-349, another 10. Now, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, adding up, that's 10 (100s) + 10 (200s) + 10 (300s) + 10 (400s) = 40 fours in the tens place. \n\nWait, but in the 400-488 range, the tens digit can go up to 8, but since we're only considering up to 488, does that affect the count? Hmm, no, because 440-449 is entirely within 400-488, so it's 10 numbers. So, 40 fours in the tens place across all three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 4's in the units place for three-digit numbers. Again, for each hundred, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in 100-199, the units digit is 4 for 104, 114, 124, 134, 144, 154, 164, 174, 184, 194. That's 10 numbers. Similarly, in 200-299, it's 204, 214, ..., 294, another 10. In 300-399, it's 304, 314, ..., 394, another 10. In 400-488, the units digit is 4 for 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, 484 is within 488, so that's 9 numbers. Wait, 404 to 484 in steps of 10: that's (484 - 404)/10 + 1 = (80)/10 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, in the 400-488 range, there are 9 fours in the units place. So, adding up: 10 (100s) + 10 (200s) + 10 (300s) + 9 (400s) = 39 fours in the units place.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 100-199, 10 numbers ending with 4: 104,114,...,194. That's 10. Similarly for 200-299 and 300-399, each has 10. For 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs at 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. So, 10+10+10+9=39. So, 39 fours in the units place.\n\nSo, for three-digit numbers, the total number of fours is 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168 fours.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. So, 168 fours in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, let's sum up all fours across all page numbers:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 four\n\nTwo-digit: 19 fours\n\nThree-digit: 168 fours\n\nTotal fours = 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check the counts.\n\nSingle-digit: 4 appears once. Correct.\n\nTwo-digit: Tens place (40-49): 10 fours. Units place: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, but 44 has two 4's, so that's 9 fours in the units place, but 44 is already counted in the tens place. So, total two-digit fours: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. Correct.\n\nThree-digit: Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTens place: For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each in the first three hundreds, and 10 numbers in 400-488 (440-449). So, 10+10+10+10=40. Correct.\n\nUnits place: For 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: 10 each, so 30. For 400-488: 404,414,...,484: 9 numbers. So, total units place fours: 30 +9=39. Correct.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 +39=168. So, 168 in three-digit. Adding up: 1 +19=20, +168=188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with single-digit: 8 appears once, on page 8. So, 1 eight.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: Let's count the number of 8's in the tens and units places.\n\nTens place: 80-89. That's 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, 10 eights.\n\nUnits place: Numbers ending with 8 from 10 to 99: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, but 88 has two 8's, so we have 9 eights in the units place. So, total two-digit eights: 10 (tens) +9 (units)=19.\n\nWait, but 88 is counted twice: once in tens and once in units. So, total eights in two-digit numbers: 10 +9=19, but 88 contributes two eights, so the total count is correct.\n\nNow, three-digit numbers: Let's count the number of 8's in hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nHundreds place: Numbers from 800-899. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can't be 8. So, no eights in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers each. So, in 100-199: 180-189, 10 numbers. Similarly, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, for each hundred except the last, there are 10 eights, but in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, let's calculate:\n\n100-199: 180-189: 10 eights\n\n200-299: 280-289: 10 eights\n\n300-399: 380-389: 10 eights\n\n400-488: 480-488: 9 eights\n\nSo, total in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +9=39 eights.\n\nNow, units place: For each hundred, the units digit is 8 every 10 numbers. So, in 100-199: 108,118,...,198: 10 numbers. Similarly, 200-299: 208,218,...,298:10. 300-399:308,...,398:10. 400-488:408,418,...,488. Wait, how many are there?\n\nFrom 400-488, the units digit 8 occurs at 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included. So, units place eights: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nWait, but let me check: 100-199: 108,118,...,198: that's 10 numbers. Same for 200-299 and 300-399. For 400-488: starting at 408, each 10 numbers: 408,418,...,488. How many terms? (488 - 408)/10 +1= (80)/10 +1=9. So, 9 numbers. So, units place eights: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total eights in three-digit numbers: tens place 39 + units place 39=78.\n\nWait, but wait: in the tens place, we had 39 eights, and in the units place, 39 eights. So, total eights in three-digit numbers: 39 +39=78.\n\nNow, let's sum up all eights across all page numbers:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:78\n\nTotal eights=1+19+78=98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me double-check:\n\nSingle-digit:8 once.\n\nTwo-digit: tens 10, units 9: total 19.\n\nThree-digit: tens 39, units 39: total 78.\n\nSo, 1+19=20, +78=98. So, 98 eights in total.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours -98 eights=90.\n\nWait, that's a big difference. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me go through the counts again.\n\nFours:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds:400-488:89 fours\n\nTens:100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488:10 each for first three, 10 for 400-488: total 40.\n\nUnits:100-199,200-299,300-399:10 each, 400-488:9. So, 30+9=39.\n\nTotal three-digit fours:89+40+39=168.\n\nTotal fours:1+19+168=188.\n\nEights:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19\n\nThree-digit:\n\nTens:100-199,200-299,300-399:10 each, 400-488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nUnits:100-199,200-299,300-399:10 each, 400-488:9. So, 39.\n\nTotal three-digit eights:39+39=78.\n\nTotal eights:1+19+78=98.\n\nSo, 188 fours -98 eights=90.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a lot. Let me check if I double-counted any digits. For example, in two-digit numbers, 44 has two 4's, but I counted it as two separate counts in tens and units, which is correct. Similarly, in three-digit numbers, numbers like 404 have two 4's, but I counted each occurrence separately, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the three-digit tens place for fours. From 100-199, the tens digit is 4 for 140-149:10 numbers. Similarly for 200-299,300-399, and 400-488 (440-449). So, 10 each, except in 400-488, it's 10. So, 10+10+10+10=40. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, units place for fours: 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 39. Correct.\n\nSo, 40+39=79 in three-digit tens and units? Wait, no, wait: in three-digit numbers, the hundreds place is 89, tens is 40, units is 39. So, 89+40+39=168. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights, in three-digit numbers, tens place:39, units place:39. So, 78. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 fours -98 eights=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the three-digit units place for fours. Let me check again.\n\nIn the units place for fours in three-digit numbers:\n\n100-199:104,114,...,194:10 numbers.\n\n200-299:204,214,...,294:10.\n\n300-399:304,...,394:10.\n\n400-488:404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484:9 numbers.\n\nSo, 10+10+10+9=39. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in units place:\n\n100-199:108,...,198:10.\n\n200-299:208,...,298:10.\n\n300-399:308,...,398:10.\n\n400-488:408,418,...,488:9.\n\nSo, 39. Correct.\n\nSo, the counts seem accurate. Therefore, the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: 1-9. The digit 4 appears only once, which is on page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence. \n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: 10-99. Here, I need to consider both the tens place and the units place. \n\nFor the tens place: The 4 can appear in the tens digit, which would be from 40 to 49. That's 10 pages, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. \n\nFor the units place: The 4 can appear in the units digit every 10 pages, starting from 4, 14, 24, ..., 94. That's 10 occurrences as well. \n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens) + 10 (units) = 20. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100-488. This is a bit more involved. \n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\n- For hundreds digit 1: The number of 4's in the hundreds place is zero because it's 100-199. \n- For hundreds digit 2: Similarly, zero 4's in the hundreds place because it's 200-299. \n- For hundreds digit 3: Zero 4's in the hundreds place because it's 300-399. \n- For hundreds digit 4: Now, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 pages has a 4 in the hundreds place. That's 89 occurrences.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place in three-digit numbers. \n\n- For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: The tens digit can be 0-9. We need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 100 pages. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). Since there are three hundreds, that's 3 * 10 = 30 occurrences. \n\n- For hundreds digit 4: From 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages. However, since the book ends at 488, we need to check if 440-449 are all within 400-488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 pages are included. So, that's 10 occurrences. \n\nAdding these together, the total number of 4's in the tens place for three-digit numbers is 30 + 10 = 40.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. \n\n- For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 in the units place (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194; similarly for 200s and 300s). So, 3 * 10 = 30 occurrences. \n\n- For hundreds digit 4: From 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 pages. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see: starting from 404, 414, 424, ..., up to 484. How many such numbers are there? The first is 404, and the last is 484. The difference is 80, so 80 / 10 = 8 intervals, which gives 9 numbers (including both start and end). Wait, let me check: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total number of 4's in the units place for three-digit numbers is 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 20\n- Three-digit: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\nTotal 4's = 1 + 20 + 168 = 189.\n\nWait, let me double-check the three-digit counts. Hundreds place: 89, tens: 40, units: 39. 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. Then plus single and two-digit: 1 + 20 = 21. 21 + 168 = 189. Okay, that seems right.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit: 1-9. The digit 8 appears once, on page 8.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers: 10-99.\n\nTens place: The 8 can be in the tens digit from 80-89, which is 10 pages. So, 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: The 8 can appear every 10 pages: 18, 28, 38, ..., 98. That's 9 occurrences because from 10-99, the units digit 8 appears 9 times? Wait, no. Wait, 10-99: the units digit 8 appears once in each ten, so from 10-99, that's 9 tens (10-90), so 9 occurrences. Wait, but 88 is included in both tens and units, but we're counting separately. So, units place: 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, total 8's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nWait, let me make sure. From 10-99, the tens digit 8 is 10 numbers (80-89), and the units digit 8 is from 18,28,...,98, which is 9 numbers because 18 is the first and 98 is the last, so (98 - 18)/10 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, yes, 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nNow, three-digit page numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\n- For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: The hundreds digit is not 8, so no 8's here.\n- For hundreds digit 4: From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, not 8, so no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, hundreds place contributes 0.\n\nTens place: For three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 0-9. We need to count how many times 8 appears in the tens place across all hundreds.\n\n- For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, 380-389). So, 3 * 10 = 30 occurrences.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4: From 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total number of 8's in the tens place for three-digit numbers is 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nUnits place: For three-digit numbers, the units digit can be 0-9. We need to count how many times 8 appears in the units place.\n\n- For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each hundred has 10 occurrences of 8 in the units place (e.g., 108, 118, ..., 198; similarly for 200s and 300s). So, 3 * 10 = 30 occurrences.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4: From 400-488, the units digit 8 appears every 10 pages. Starting from 408, 418, 428, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 408, the last is 488. The difference is 80, so 80 / 10 = 8 intervals, which gives 9 numbers (including both start and end). Wait, 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total number of 8's in the units place for three-digit numbers is 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nAdding up all the 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\nTotal 8's = 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Single-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:78. 1+19=20, 20+78=98. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's:189, total 8's:98. The difference is 189 - 98 = 91.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\n189 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 91.\n\nYes, that seems to be the case. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in each place (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Single-digit (1-9):** 1 occurrence (page 4).\n- **Two-digit (10-99):**\n  - Tens place: 10 occurrences (40-49).\n  - Units place: 10 occurrences (4,14,24,...,94).\n  - Total: 20.\n- **Three-digit (100-488):**\n  - Hundreds place: 89 occurrences (400-488).\n  - Tens place: 40 occurrences (3 hundreds with 10 each + 10 in 440-449).\n  - Units place: 39 occurrences (3 hundreds with 10 each + 9 in 404,414,...,484).\n  - Total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n- **Total 4's:** 1 + 20 + 168 = 189.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Single-digit (1-9):** 1 occurrence (page 8).\n- **Two-digit (10-99):**\n  - Tens place: 10 occurrences (80-89).\n  - Units place: 9 occurrences (18,28,...,98).\n  - Total: 19.\n- **Three-digit (100-488):**\n  - Hundreds place: 0 occurrences.\n  - Tens place: 39 occurrences (3 hundreds with 10 each + 9 in 480-488).\n  - Units place: 39 occurrences (3 hundreds with 10 each + 9 in 408,418,...,488).\n  - Total: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n- **Total 8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 189 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: The only single-digit number that has a 4 is 4 itself. So, that's 1 occurrence of the digit 4.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: Here, the 4 can appear in the tens place or the units place. Let me calculate each separately.\n\nFor the tens place: The numbers from 40 to 49 each have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4.\n\nFor the units place: The numbers 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but wait, since we're only going up to 99, the next would be 104, but that's a three-digit number. So, from 10 to 99, the units place 4 occurs every 10 numbers. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see: 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 times. But wait, 44 has two 4's, so I have to make sure I'm not double-counting. Wait, no, I'm just counting each occurrence, so each 4 in the units place is a separate occurrence. So, that's 9 times. But wait, 44 is included here, so does that mean I'm counting the 4 in the tens place and the 4 in the units place separately? Yes, because in the tens place, I already counted 10 occurrences (40-49), and in the units place, I'm counting each 4, including 44. So, total for two-digit numbers: 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 occurrences of 4.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 10 to 99, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the units digit 4 appears once. There are 9 such groups (10-19 up to 90-99), so 9 times. But wait, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4, but the units digit 4 also appears once, which is 44. So, yes, 9 occurrences in the units place for two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100 to 488. Let's break this down into hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers: The tens digit can be 0-9, and we're looking for when it's 4. So, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), we can calculate how many times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nFrom 100-199: The tens digit is 4 in the range 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 200-299: Similarly, 240-249: 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 300-399: 340-349: 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 400-488: The tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 occurrences.\n\nSo, total for the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 occurrences.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers: Similarly, for each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9, so 4 appears once every 10 numbers. Let's calculate for each hundred.\n\nFrom 100-199: The units digit 4 occurs in 104, 114, 124, 134, 144, 154, 164, 174, 184, 194. That's 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 200-299: Similarly, 204, 214, ..., 294: 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 300-399: 304, 314, ..., 394: 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 400-488: Now, this is where it might be a bit tricky because 488 is less than 499. So, the units digit 4 occurs in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, let's count these: starting at 404, each 10 numbers. So, 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 occurrences because 494 would be next, but 494 is beyond 488. So, from 404 to 484, that's 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nTherefore, total for units place in three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 occurrences.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: hundreds (89) + tens (40) + units (39) = 89 + 40 = 129; 129 + 39 = 168.\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Single-digit: 1, two-digit: 19, three-digit: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. So, 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 168 = 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process.\n\nSingle-digit: The only single-digit number with an 8 is 8. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: 8 can appear in the tens place or the units place.\n\nTens place: 80-89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: Numbers like 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Wait, but 88 has two 8's, but I'm counting each occurrence separately. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 occurrences.\n\nThree-digit numbers: Now, hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no three-digit page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nTens place: For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nFrom 100-199: 180-189: 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 200-299: 280-289: 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 300-399: 380-389: 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 400-488: 480-488. Wait, the tens digit is 8, so it's 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total for tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: For each hundred, how many times does 8 appear in the units place.\n\nFrom 100-199: 108, 118, 128, 138, 148, 158, 168, 178, 188, 198: 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 200-299: 208, 218, ..., 298: 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 300-399: 308, 318, ..., 398: 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 400-488: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. Let's count these: starting at 408, each 10 numbers. So, 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total for units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 occurrences.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: tens (39) + units (39) = 78.\n\nWait, but wait, the hundreds place in three-digit numbers for 8's is 0, so total 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Single-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:39 (tens) +39 (units) =78. So, 1 +19=20, 20+78=98. So, 98 8's in total.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, counting 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit: tens (10) + units (9) =19\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place: from 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTens place: 10 (100-199) +10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+10 (400-449) =40. Wait, earlier I thought 400-488 for tens place 4 would be 10, but actually, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct, 10.\n\nUnits place: 10 (100-199) +10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+9 (400-488) =39.\n\nSo, three-digit 4's:89+40+39=168. Then total 4's:1+19+168=188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit: tens (10) + units (9)=19\n\nThree-digit:\n\nTens place:10 (100-199)+10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+9 (400-488)=39\n\nUnits place:10 (100-199)+10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+9 (400-488)=39\n\nSo, three-digit 8's:39+39=78\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let's start with single-digit page numbers. These are from 1 to 9. The digit 4 appears exactly once here, which is on page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence. Now, moving on to two-digit numbers, which are from 10 to 99. In two-digit numbers, the 4 can appear in the tens place or the units place. \n\nFirst, the tens place: numbers like 40-49. That's 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place, so that's 10 occurrences. Then, the units place: numbers like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, so I need to be careful not to double count. But actually, when counting digits, each occurrence is counted separately, so 44 contributes two 4's, but for the purpose of counting, I just list all the numbers where the units digit is 4. So from 10 to 99, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? That would be 9 numbers: 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. But wait, 44 is included here, so that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place, but 44 also has a 4 in the tens place, which we've already counted in the tens place. So, for the units place, it's 9 occurrences, but 44 has already been counted in the tens place, so I think it's still 9 separate 4's in the units place. Wait, no, because when counting digits, each digit is considered separately. So, for the tens place, we have 10 4's (40-49), and for the units place, we have 9 4's (14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94). But 44 has both digits as 4, so that's two 4's in that number, so in total, for two-digit numbers, the number of 4's is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. But wait, 44 is included in both counts, so that's correct because it has two 4's. So, total 19 4's in two-digit numbers. \n\nWait, but let me check: from 10-99, how many 4's in the tens place? 10 numbers (40-49), so 10 digits. How many in the units place? From 10-99, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten, so for each ten, there's one 4 in the units place. There are 9 tens (10-99), so 9 occurrences. So, 10 + 9 = 19. That seems right. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because we have hundreds, tens, and units places. Let's break this down by each digit place. \n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, for the hundreds place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. \n\nNext, the tens place. We need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place from 100 to 488. Let's think about this. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, for each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0-9, and each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. \n\nWait, but 400-488 is a bit different because it's not a full hundred. So, let's handle each hundred separately. \n\nFirst, 100-199: the tens digit is 4 for numbers 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. \n\nSimilarly, 200-299: tens digit 4 is 240-249, another 10 numbers. \n\n300-399: tens digit 4 is 340-349, another 10 numbers. \n\nNow, 400-488: the tens digit can be 4, so numbers 440-449. That's 10 numbers. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. \n\nSo, total in the tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 occurrences. \n\nWait, but let me check: from 100-399, each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, so 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30. Then, 400-488: tens digit 4 is 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 40. That seems correct. \n\nNow, the units place for three-digit numbers. We need to count how many times 4 appears in the units place from 100 to 488. Again, let's break it down by hundreds. \n\nFor 100-199: units digit 4 occurs in 104,114,124,134,144,154,164,174,184,194. That's 10 numbers. \n\nSimilarly, 200-299: 204,214,224,234,244,254,264,274,284,294. Another 10. \n\n300-399: 304,314,324,334,344,354,364,374,384,394. Another 10. \n\n400-488: units digit 4 occurs in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488. So, let's count: starting at 404, adding 10 each time. 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 404 + 9\u00d710 = 484, which is within 488. So, 9 occurrences. \n\nSo, total in units place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39. \n\nWait, but let me check: from 400-488, how many numbers have units digit 4? It's every 10 numbers starting from 404 up to 484. So, 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 404 + 8\u00d710 = 484, so 9 numbers. So, yes, 9. \n\nSo, total units place 4's in three-digit numbers: 39. \n\nNow, adding up all the 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89 + 40 = 129 + 39 = 168. \n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check. \n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake. The hundreds place for three-digit numbers: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's. \n\nTens place: 40 4's. \n\nUnits place: 39 4's. \n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. \n\nBut wait, let's add up all the 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1 + 19 = 20 + 168 = 188. \n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as each digit place separately across all numbers. \n\nAlternatively, another approach is to consider each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers from 1 to 488 and count the number of 4's in each place. \n\nLet me try that approach to verify. \n\nStarting with units place: how many times does 4 appear in the units place from 1 to 488? \n\nWell, in each block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9, so 4 appears once every 10 numbers. \n\nTotal numbers: 488. \n\nNumber of complete blocks of 10: 48 full blocks (since 48\u00d710=480). Each block contributes 1 occurrence of 4 in the units place, so 48\u00d71=48. \n\nThen, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits from 1-8, so no 4's in the units place here. \n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 48. \n\nWait, but earlier I had 39 in three-digit units place, but that was only for three-digit numbers. Hmm, perhaps this approach is better. \n\nSimilarly, for tens place: how many times does 4 appear in the tens place from 1 to 488? \n\nIn each block of 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49 in 1-100, 140-149 in 100-199, etc.). \n\nNumber of complete hundreds: 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 occurrences, so 4\u00d710=40. \n\nThen, the last partial hundred: 401-488. The tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 more. \n\nTotal tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. \n\nWait, but earlier I had 40 in three-digit tens place, but that was only for three-digit numbers. Hmm, perhaps this approach is better. \n\nNow, hundreds place: how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? \n\nFrom 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. \n\nSo, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98 + 89 = 187. \n\nWait, earlier I had 188, so there's a discrepancy here. Let me see where I went wrong. \n\nIn the first approach, I had single-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:168, total 1+19+168=188. \n\nIn the second approach, units:48, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 187. \n\nSo, which one is correct? \n\nWait, perhaps in the first approach, I overcounted somewhere. Let me check. \n\nIn the first approach, single-digit:1 (correct). \n\nTwo-digit: tens place 10 (40-49), units place 9 (14,24,...,94). So, 10+9=19. \n\nThree-digit: hundreds place 89 (400-488), tens place 40 (10 per hundred for 100-399, and 10 in 400-488), units place 39 (10 per hundred for 100-399, and 9 in 400-488). \n\nSo, 89+40+39=168. \n\nAdding up: 1+19=20 +168=188. \n\nIn the second approach, units:48, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 187. \n\nWait, perhaps the second approach is missing something. Let me check the units place again. \n\nIn the second approach, units place: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing 1, so 48. But in the first approach, for three-digit numbers, units place was 39, but single-digit and two-digit numbers also contribute to units place. \n\nWait, in the first approach, single-digit: page 4 is a single 4 in units place. Two-digit: units place 9 (14,24,...,94). Three-digit: units place 39. So total units place 4's: 1 + 9 + 39 = 49. \n\nBut in the second approach, I got 48. Hmm, that's the discrepancy. \n\nWait, let's count the units place manually. \n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? \n\nThey are: 4,14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94,104,114,...,194,204,...,294,304,...,394,404,...,484. \n\nLet's see: from 1-99, how many? 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,94. \n\nFrom 100-199: 10 numbers:104,114,...,194. \n\nFrom 200-299:10 numbers:204,...,294. \n\nFrom 300-399:10 numbers:304,...,394. \n\nFrom 400-488: let's see, starting at 404, then 414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. \n\nSo, total units place 4's: 10 (1-99) + 10 (100-199) +10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+9 (400-488)= 10+10+10+10+9=49. \n\nSo, the correct count is 49, not 48. So, the second approach was wrong because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which truncates to 48, but the actual count is 49 because 404 is the 41st occurrence, and so on up to 484, which is the 49th. \n\nSo, units place:49. \n\nTens place: let's recount. \n\nFrom 1-99: tens digit 4 is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. \n\nFrom 100-199: 140-149, 10 numbers. \n\nFrom 200-299:240-249,10 numbers. \n\nFrom 300-399:340-349,10 numbers. \n\nFrom 400-488:440-449,10 numbers. \n\nSo, total tens place 4's:10+10+10+10+10=50. \n\nHundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each with hundreds digit 4. So, 89. \n\nThus, total 4's:49 (units)+50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188. \n\nThat matches the first approach. So, the correct total number of 4's is 188. \n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. \n\nUsing the same approach: units, tens, hundreds places. \n\nUnits place: how many times does 8 appear? \n\nFrom 1 to 488, numbers ending with 8 are:8,18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98,108,118,...,198,208,...,298,308,...,398,408,...,488. \n\nLet's count: \n\n1-99: 10 numbers (8,18,...,98). \n\n100-199:10 numbers (108,118,...,198). \n\n200-299:10 numbers (208,...,298). \n\n300-399:10 numbers (308,...,398). \n\n400-488:408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included, but 498 would be beyond 488. \n\nSo, total units place 8's:10+10+10+10+9=49. \n\nWait, but let me check: from 400-488, units digit 8:408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers. \n\nSo, total units place 8's:49. \n\nTens place: how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? \n\nFrom 1-99:80-89, which is 10 numbers. \n\nFrom 100-199:180-189,10 numbers. \n\nFrom 200-299:280-289,10 numbers. \n\nFrom 300-399:380-389,10 numbers. \n\nFrom 400-488:480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), but only the tens digit is 8, so 480-488: the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so that's 9 numbers. \n\nSo, total tens place 8's:10 (1-99)+10 (100-199)+10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+9 (400-488)=49. \n\nWait, but let me check: in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 9. \n\nSo, tens place 8's:49. \n\nHundreds place: how many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? \n\nFrom 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences. \n\nThus, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =98. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. \n\nWait, from 1-488, the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0. \n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place 8's were 49 and tens place 8's were 49, so total 98. \n\nWait, but let me verify the tens place count again. \n\nIn the tens place, from 1-99:80-89, 10 numbers. \n\n100-199:180-189,10 numbers. \n\n200-299:280-289,10 numbers. \n\n300-399:380-389,10 numbers. \n\n400-488:480-488, which is 9 numbers. \n\nSo, 10+10+10+10+9=49. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSo, total 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)=98. \n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. \n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. \n\nWait, let me recount the 4's and 8's using another method to confirm. \n\nAlternative approach for 4's: \n\nEach digit place (units, tens, hundreds) can be considered separately. \n\nUnits place: as above, 49. \n\nTens place:50. \n\nHundreds place:89. \n\nTotal:49+50+89=188. \n\nFor 8's: \n\nUnits place:49. \n\nTens place:49. \n\nHundreds place:0. \n\nTotal:98. \n\nDifference:188-98=90. \n\nYes, that seems consistent. \n\nWait, but earlier when I thought of 4's as 187, that was incorrect because I had a miscalculation in the units place. But after correcting, it's 188. \n\nSo, the final answer is that there are 90 more 4's than 8's. \n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place.\n   - Total units place 4's: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, which rounds up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - In each block of 100 numbers, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - Total tens place 4's: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400 to 488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers contribute one 8 in the units place.\n   - Total units place 8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - In each block of 100 numbers, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n   - From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, contributing 9 numbers.\n   - Total tens place 8's: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit 8 never appears since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: from 1 to 9, the only 4 is page 4. So that's 1 occurrence of 4. \n\nNext, for two-digit numbers: from 10 to 99. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers 40-49 each have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4. \n\nFor the units place: The numbers 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94 each have a 4 in the units place. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, so I should count each occurrence. Let me list them: 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place, except 44, which actually has two 4's. Wait, so does that mean I should count each digit separately? So, 44 contributes two 4's, so in the units place, it's one 4, and in the tens place, another 4. So, in the units place for two-digit numbers, I have 9 occurrences, but 44 contributes an extra one in the tens place. Wait, no, I think I might be confusing. Let me clarify: when considering the units place, I count how many times 4 appears in the units digit across all two-digit numbers. So from 10 to 99, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So in each set of ten, like 10-19, 20-29, etc., the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 such sets (10-19 up to 90-99), so 9 occurrences. But wait, 40-49 is a special case because the tens digit is 4, but the units digit can still be 4, so 44 would have both digits as 4. So, when counting the units place, 44 is included in the 40-49 range, so the units digit 4 occurs once in each ten, so 9 times in total for two-digit numbers. But wait, 40-49 is the 4th set, so in that set, the units digit 4 occurs once (at 44). So, total units digit 4's in two-digit numbers: 9. Similarly, tens digit 4's: 10, as in 40-49. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. Wait, but 44 is counted twice here, once in the tens and once in the units. That's correct because it has two 4's. So, that's okay.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers: from 100 to 488. Here, each page number has three digits: hundreds, tens, and units. I need to count how many times 4 appears in each of these places.\n\nFirst, hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, for hundreds digit 4, the numbers are from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times.\n\nNext, tens place: I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens digit across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488. Let's break this down by hundreds.\n\nFor hundreds digit 1: 100-199. The tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (e.g., 140-149). Since there are 100 numbers in each hundred, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times in each hundred. But wait, from 100-199, the tens digit 4 occurs in 140-149, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, for hundreds digit 2: 200-299, same thing: 240-249, 10 numbers. Similarly for hundreds digit 3: 300-399, 340-349, 10 numbers. Now, for hundreds digit 4: 400-488. The tens digit can go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 449 exist? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 440-449 is 10 numbers. Therefore, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times for each hundred, and since there are 4 hundreds (1,2,3,4), that's 4*10=40 times. Wait, but wait, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can go up to 8, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total tens digit 4's: 40.\n\nNow, units place: Similarly, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the units digit across all three-digit numbers. Let's consider each hundred separately.\n\nFor hundreds digit 1: 100-199. The units digit 4 occurs once every 10 numbers: 104, 114, 124, ..., 194. How many is that? From 104 to 194, stepping by 10: (194 - 104)/10 + 1 = (90)/10 +1=9+1=10 times. So, 10 occurrences in 100-199.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digit 2: 200-299, units digit 4 occurs 10 times: 204,214,...,294.\n\nSame for hundreds digit 3: 300-399, units digit 4 occurs 10 times: 304,314,...,394.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Now, how many times does the units digit 4 appear here? Let's see: starting from 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488, so we stop at 484. So, how many numbers is that? Let's see: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers. Wait, because from 400 to 488, the units digit 4 occurs every 10 numbers starting at 404. So, 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 404 is the first, and 484 is the last, which is 9 steps. Wait, let me check: 404 is the first, then each +10, so 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers. So, in the units place for hundreds digit 4, we have 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total units digit 4's: 10 (from 100-199) +10 (200-299) +10 (300-399) +9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nWait, but wait, when hundreds digit is 4, units digit 4 occurs 9 times, not 10, because 484 is the last one, and 494 would be beyond 488. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, total units digit 4's: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89+40=129, 129+39=168.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Hundreds place: 89, tens:40, units:39. So 89+40=129, 129+39=168. So, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 168.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1+19=20, 20+168=188. So, total 4's:188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process.\n\nSingle-digit page numbers: 8 occurs once (page 8).\n\nTwo-digit numbers: from 10-99.\n\nTens place: numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: numbers where the units digit is 8: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the units place. However, 88 has two 8's, so in the units place, it's counted once, and in the tens place, once. So, units digit 8's: 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: tens (10) + units (9) =19.\n\nNow, three-digit numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: hundreds digit is 8? Wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 occurrences.\n\nTens place: how many times does 8 appear in the tens digit?\n\nFor each hundred (100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in the range X80-X89, where X is the hundreds digit.\n\nFor hundreds digit 1: 180-189: 10 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, hundreds digit 2:280-289:10.\n\nHundreds digit 3:380-389:10.\n\nHundreds digit 4:480-488: since 488 is the last page, 480-488 includes 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8, so from 480 to 489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times here.\n\nSo, total tens digit 8's: 10 (100-199) +10 (200-299) +10 (300-399) +9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nUnits place: how many times does 8 appear in the units digit across all three-digit numbers.\n\nFor each hundred:\n\nHundreds digit 1: 100-199. Units digit 8 occurs at 108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198. That's 10 numbers.\n\nHundreds digit 2: 208,218,...,298:10 numbers.\n\nHundreds digit 3: 308,318,...,398:10 numbers.\n\nHundreds digit 4: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Wait, let's see: starting from 408, each +10 up to 488. So, 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included, but 498 would be beyond 488. So, 9 numbers.\n\nSo, units digit 8's: 10 (100-199) +10 (200-299) +10 (300-399) +9 (400-488) =39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens (39) + units (39) =78.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) =1+19=20, 20+78=98.\n\nWait, so total 8's:98.\n\nNow, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. So, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems a bit high, and I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me go through the counts again.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1.\n\nTwo-digit: tens place 40-49:10, units place 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94:9. So, 10+9=19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place:400-488:89.\n\nTens place: for each hundred (1,2,3,4), 10 each:4*10=40.\n\nUnits place:100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nTotal 4's:1+19+89+40+39=1+19=20, 20+89=109, 109+40=149, 149+39=188. That seems correct.\n\nCounting 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1.\n\nTwo-digit: tens place 80-89:10, units place 18,28,...,98:9. So, 10+9=19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nTens place:100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nUnits place:100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+39+39=1+19=20, 20+39=59, 59+39=98.\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the three-digit units place for 4's. For 400-488, units digit 4 occurs at 404,414,...,484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. So, 10+10+10+9=39. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in three-digit units place:400-488, units digit 8 occurs at 408,418,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, 8's:98, difference:90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I included all numbers correctly. For example, in the three-digit tens place for 8's, 400-488: the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. So, 39 in tens place, 39 in units place, total 78. Plus single and two-digit:1+19=20, total 98.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: the only single-digit number that has a 4 is 4 itself. So, that's one 4. \n\nNext, for two-digit numbers, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. \n\nIn the tens place: the numbers are 40-49. That's 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place. So, that's 10 fours. \n\nIn the units place: the numbers are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but since we're only going up to 99, I need to check if 94 is included. Yes, 94 is within 1-99, so that's 9 numbers. However, I think I made a mistake here. Let me recount. From 10-99, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, etc.), there is one number ending with 4. There are 9 such groups (10-99), so that's 9 fours in the units place. Wait, but in the tens place, we had 10 fours (40-49). So, for two-digit numbers, total fours are 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 fours. \n\nWait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place, so that's 10 fours. Then, for the units place, starting from 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, so 9 fours. So, total of 19 fours in two-digit numbers. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers: 100-488. Here, each number has hundreds, tens, and units digits. I need to count the number of 4's in each digit place. \n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, numbers from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. \n\nFor the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, there are 89 fours. \n\nNext, the tens place: For each hundred group (100-199, 200-299, etc.), the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred group, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). \n\nBut we have to consider up to 488. So, for the hundreds groups 100-399, each has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 3 groups * 10 = 30 fours. \n\nNow, for the 400-488 group, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 440-449. That's another 10 fours. So, total in the tens place: 30 + 10 = 40 fours. \n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. \n\nNow, the units place: Again, for each hundred group, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred group, the units digit is 4 for 10 numbers. \n\nFrom 100-399, each hundred group has 10 numbers ending with 4, so 3 groups * 10 = 30 fours. \n\nIn the 400-488 group, the units digit is 4 for numbers 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, let's count: starting at 404, each subsequent 10 numbers adds another 4. From 404 to 484, that's (484 - 404)/10 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, 9 fours in the units place for the 400-488 group. \n\nWait, but 484 is the last number before 488, so yes, that's correct. So, total units place fours in three-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39 fours. \n\nWait, but 30 + 9 is 39? Wait, 30 + 9 is 39, yes. \n\nSo, total fours in three-digit numbers: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89 + 40 = 129, plus 39 is 168 fours. \n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again. \n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. \n\nTens place: For each hundred group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each has 10 fours in the tens place, so 3*10=30. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, total tens place fours: 30 +10=40. \n\nUnits place: For each hundred group, 10 fours, so 3*10=30. Then, in 400-488, the units digit is 4 for 404,414,...,484. Let's count how many: starting at 404, each 10 numbers adds one, so 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers. So, 30 +9=39 fours in the units place. \n\nSo, total fours in three-digit numbers: 89 +40 +39= 168. \n\nWait, that seems correct. \n\nNow, adding up all fours: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1 +19=20, plus 168=188 fours. \n\nWait, that can't be right because 168 in three digits alone seems high. Let me think again. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the three-digit counts. Let me try a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, for three-digit numbers from 100 to 488, each digit can be considered separately. \n\nHundreds place: 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. \n\nTens place: For each hundred group, the tens digit cycles 0-9. So, in 100-199, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (140-149). Similarly, in 200-299, 240-249, another 10. Same for 300-399: 340-349, 10 more. Now, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 3*10 +10=40. \n\nUnits place: Similarly, for each hundred group, units digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, 100-199: 104,114,...,194: 10 numbers. Same for 200-299: 204,214,...,294:10. Same for 300-399: 304,...,394:10. Now, in 400-488, units digit is 4 for 404,414,...,484. How many? Let's see: from 404 to 484, stepping by 10: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the 9th after 404. So, units place fours: 3*10 +9=39. \n\nSo, total fours in three-digit numbers: 89 +40 +39=168. \n\nAdding single-digit (1) and two-digit (19): 1+19=20. Total fours: 20+168=188. \n\nWait, that seems high, but I think it's correct. \n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. \n\nStarting with single-digit: only page 8, so one 8. \n\nTwo-digit numbers: count 8's in tens and units places. \n\nTens place: 80-89, which is 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place, so 10 eights. \n\nUnits place: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights. \n\nWait, but 88 is included in both tens and units places. So, total two-digit eights: 10 (tens) +9 (units)=19 eights. \n\nNow, three-digit numbers: 100-488. \n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1,2,3,4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place in three-digit numbers because the hundreds digits go up to 4. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. \n\nTens place: For each hundred group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers each. \n\nSo, 100-199: 180-189:10 eights. \n\n200-299:280-289:10 eights. \n\n300-399:380-389:10 eights. \n\n400-488:480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. \n\nSo, total tens place eights: 3*10 +9=39. \n\nUnits place: For each hundred group, the units digit is 8 for 10 numbers. \n\n100-199: 108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198:10 eights. \n\n200-299:208,...,298:10 eights. \n\n300-399:308,...,398:10 eights. \n\n400-488:408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Let's count: starting at 408, each 10 numbers adds one. 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers. \n\nSo, units place eights: 3*10 +9=39. \n\nTotal eights in three-digit numbers: tens place (39) + units place (39)=78. \n\nAdding single-digit (1) and two-digit (19): 1+19=20. So, total eights: 20+78=98. \n\nWait, let me verify that. \n\nSingle-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:78. 1+19=20, 20+78=98 eights. \n\nNow, the number of fours was 188, and eights are 98. \n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90. \n\nWait, so there are 90 more fours than eights. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check the counts because this seems like a big difference. \n\nLet me recount the fours and eights separately. \n\nFours: \n\nSingle-digit:1 \n\nTwo-digit: tens place 10 (40-49), units place 9 (14,24,...,94). So, 19. \n\nThree-digit: hundreds place 89 (400-488), tens place 40 (10 each in 100-399, and 10 in 400-488), units place 39 (10 each in 100-399, and 9 in 400-488). So, 89+40+39=168. \n\nTotal fours:1+19+168=188. \n\nEights: \n\nSingle-digit:1 \n\nTwo-digit: tens place 10 (80-89), units place 9 (18,28,...,98). So, 19. \n\nThree-digit: tens place 39 (10 each in 100-399, and 9 in 400-488), units place 39 (10 each in 100-399, and 9 in 400-488). So, 39+39=78. \n\nTotal eights:1+19+78=98. \n\nDifference:188-98=90. \n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 4, so 1 occurrence.\n- **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n  - Tens place: Pages 40-49 (10 occurrences).\n  - Units place: Pages 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94 (9 occurrences).\n  - Total: 10 + 9 = 19 occurrences.\n- **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n  - Hundreds place: Pages 400-488 (89 occurrences).\n  - Tens place: 10 occurrences in each of the first three centuries (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and 10 in 400-449, totaling 40.\n  - Units place: 10 in each of the first three centuries and 9 in 400-488, totaling 39.\n  - Total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 8, so 1 occurrence.\n- **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n  - Tens place: Pages 80-89 (10 occurrences).\n  - Units place: Pages 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98 (9 occurrences).\n  - Total: 10 + 9 = 19 occurrences.\n- **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n  - Hundreds place: 0 occurrences (since hundreds digits are 1-4).\n  - Tens place: 10 occurrences in each of the first three centuries and 9 in 400-488, totaling 39.\n  - Units place: 10 in each of the first three centuries and 9 in 400-488, totaling 39.\n  - Total: 39 + 39 = 78 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, starting with single-digit page numbers: 1-9. Here, the only single-digit number with a 4 is 4 itself. So, that's one 4. Now, moving on to two-digit numbers: 10-99. In two-digit numbers, a 4 can appear in the tens place or the units place. Let's consider the tens place first. The tens digit being 4 means the numbers are from 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the tens place, so that's 10 fours. Next, the units place: for each ten, like 10-19, 20-29, etc., the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So from 10-99, how many tens are there? There are 9 tens (10-19 up to 90-99). But wait, in each ten, the units digit cycles from 0-9, so in each ten, the 4 appears once. So that's 9 fours in the units place. Wait, but actually, from 10-99, there are 9 decades (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 9 fours. So in two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 fours. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100-488. This is a bit more complex. Let's break it down into hundreds, tens, and units places. \n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, let's consider each hundred separately.\n\n- Hundreds digit is 1: 100-199. How many 4's are there in the hundreds place here? None, because the hundreds digit is 1. So, no contribution from the hundreds place in this range.\n- Hundreds digit is 2: 200-299. Similarly, hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's here either.\n- Hundreds digit is 3: 300-399. Again, hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's in the hundreds place.\n- Hundreds digit is 4: 400-488. Here, the hundreds digit is 4, so every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, that's 89 fours from the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's look at the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9, and we're interested in when it's 4. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in 100-199, the tens digit is 4 for 140-149, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 200-299, it's 240-249, another 10 numbers. Same for 300-399: 340-349, 10 numbers. And in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, we have 10 fours in the tens place. There are four hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours from the tens place.\n\nWait, but hold on. The last hundred is 400-488, which is only up to 488, so does the tens digit go beyond 4 in that case? No, because 440-449 is entirely within 400-488, so it's still 10 numbers. So, yes, 10 fours in the tens place for each hundred, so 40 in total.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. Similarly, the units digit cycles from 0-9 for each number. So, in each hundred, the units digit is 4 once every 10 numbers. For example, in 100-199, the units digit is 4 in 104, 114, 124, ..., 194. That's 10 numbers. Similarly, in 200-299, it's 204, 214, ..., 294: 10 numbers. In 300-399: 304, 314, ..., 394: 10 numbers. And in 400-488: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, let's count these. From 400-488, how many numbers end with 4? Starting at 404, then every 10 numbers. So, 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 494, which is beyond 488. Wait, no, 484 is within 488, so it's included. Let me count: 404 is 1, 414 is 2, 424 is 3, 434 is 4, 444 is 5, 454 is 6, 464 is 7, 474 is 8, 484 is 9. So, 9 numbers. So, in the 400-488 range, the units digit is 4 nine times. Therefore, the total units digit fours in three-digit numbers would be 3 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributing 10 each, and 400-488 contributing 9. So, 3*10 + 9 = 39 fours in the units place.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. For 100-199: 104,114,...,194: 10 numbers. Similarly for 200-299 and 300-399. For 400-488, the last number is 488, so 484 is included, which is the ninth occurrence. So yes, 3*10 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, adding up the units place fours: 39.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the fours:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: hundreds place 89, tens place 40, units place 39. So, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nTotal fours: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Single-digit: 1, two-digit: 19, three-digit: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168. So, 1 + 19 = 20, plus 168 is 188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. So, how many 8's are printed in the page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nStarting with single-digit: 1-9. The only single-digit number with an 8 is 8 itself. So, that's 1 eight.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: 10-99. Again, 8 can appear in the tens place or the units place.\n\nTens place: numbers from 80-89. That's 10 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the tens place. So, 10 eights.\n\nUnits place: for each ten, like 10-19, 20-29, etc., the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 10-99, there are 9 decades (10-19 up to 90-99). Each contributes one 8 in the units place, so 9 eights.\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, the total number of 8's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 eights.\n\nNow, three-digit numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, when is the hundreds digit 8? Well, in the range 100-488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 because the book ends at 488. So, hundreds place doesn't contribute any 8's.\n\nTens place: The tens digit can be 0-9, and we're looking for when it's 8. For each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers. So, in 100-199, it's 180-189: 10 numbers. Similarly, in 200-299: 280-289: 10 numbers. In 300-399: 380-389: 10 numbers. In 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 480-488: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488: that's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, for each hundred except the last one, we have 10 eights, and in the last hundred, 400-488, we have 9 eights.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\n- 100-199: 10\n- 200-299: 10\n- 300-399: 10\n- 400-488: 9\nTotal: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 eights in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: Similarly, the units digit is 8 once every 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488, the units digit is 8 in 10 numbers each, except maybe the last one.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\n- 100-199: 108,118,...,198: 10 numbers.\n- 200-299: 208,218,...,298: 10 numbers.\n- 300-399: 308,318,...,398: 10 numbers.\n- 400-488: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included, but 498 would be beyond 488. So, 9 numbers.\n\nSo, units place eights:\n\n- 100-199: 10\n- 200-299: 10\n- 300-399: 10\n- 400-488: 9\nTotal: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 eights in the units place.\n\nNow, adding up all the eights:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: tens place 39, units place 39. So, 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nTotal eights: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Single-digit: 1, two-digit: 19, three-digit: 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78. So, 1 + 19 = 20, plus 78 is 98. So, 98 eights in total.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through the counts again.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: tens place 10 (40-49) and units place 9 (4 in each ten except the last one where it's 40-49, but wait no, in two-digit numbers, units place 4 occurs in 10-99, which is 9 times (14,24,...,94). So, 9 units place fours. So, 10 + 9 = 19 in two-digit.\n- Three-digit: hundreds place 89 (400-488), tens place 40 (10 in each hundred, 4 hundreds), units place 39 (10 in each of first three hundreds, 9 in the last). So, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. Total fours: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: tens place 10 (80-89), units place 9 (8 in each ten except the last one, but wait, in two-digit numbers, units place 8 occurs in 10-99 as 18,28,...,98, which is 9 numbers. So, 10 + 9 = 19.\n- Three-digit: tens place: 10 in each of the first three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), and 9 in 400-488 (480-488). So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n- Units place: 10 in each of the first three hundreds, and 9 in 400-488. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n- Total eights: 1 + 19 + 39 + 39 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights is indeed 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: These are from 1 to 9. The only single-digit page number that has a 4 is page 4. So, that's one occurrence of the digit 4. \n\nNext, for two-digit page numbers: These range from 10 to 99. I think I should consider the tens place and the units place separately. \n\nIn the tens place, the digit 4 appears in the numbers 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. \n\nIn the units place, the digit 4 appears once every ten numbers, like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but from 10-99, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let me count: 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 times, right? Because from 10 to 99, each ten has one 4 in the units place, except maybe 40-49, but 44 is already counted in the tens place. Wait, no, actually, when I'm counting units place separately, I should include all instances where the units digit is 4, regardless of the tens digit. So from 10-99, that's 9 sets of ten (10-19, 20-29,...,90-99), each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 9 times. But wait, 44 has both the tens and units digit as 4, so it's counted twice. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. \n\nWait, no, actually, 40-49: the tens digit is 4 for each of the 10 numbers, so that's 10 4's. Then, in the units place, from 10-99, each ten has one 4, so that's 9 4's (since 40-49 is already covered). Wait, but 44 is in both. So, maybe the correct count is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. But wait, 44 is included in both, so does that mean I'm double-counting it? Hmm, no, because when I count the tens place, I'm counting all the 4's in the tens digit, which includes 44. When I count the units place, I'm counting all the 4's in the units digit, which also includes 44. So, 44 is counted twice, which is correct because it has two 4's. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 + 9 = 19. \n\nWait, but 40-49 is 10 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the tens place, so that's 10. Then, in the units place, for each ten, like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94, that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 10 + 9 = 19. That seems right.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: These are from 100 to 488. Let's break this down into hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because 488 is the last page. So, let's see when the hundreds digit is 4: that's from 400 to 488. How many 4's are in the hundreds place? Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. We need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens digit from 100 to 488.\n\nLet's consider each hundred separately:\n\n1. 100-199: The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 140-149. So, 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\n2. 200-299: Similarly, the tens digit is 4 for 240-249, another 10 occurrences.\n\n3. 300-399: Tens digit 4 is in 340-349, 10 more.\n\n4. 400-488: Now, the tens digit can be 4, but the units digit goes from 0 to 88. Wait, no, the tens digit is 4, so numbers are 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is fully included. So, that's 10 more.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40. Wait, but wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 488 is beyond 449, so yes, it's included. So, 40 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. We need to count how many times 4 appears in the units digit from 100 to 488.\n\nAgain, let's break it down by hundreds:\n\n1. 100-199: The units digit is 4 once every ten numbers. So, 104, 114, 124, 134, 144, 154, 164, 174, 184, 194. That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\n2. 200-299: Similarly, 204, 214, ..., 294. That's another 10.\n\n3. 300-399: 304, 314, ..., 394. Another 10.\n\n4. 400-488: Now, the units digit is 4 once every ten numbers. So, starting from 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, 484 is within 488, so that's 9 numbers. Wait, let's check: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because after 484, the next would be 494, which is beyond 488. So, only 9 4's in the units place for 400-488.\n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 404, 414,...,484. Let me count: 404 is the first, then each subsequent 10. So, from 404 to 484, that's (484 - 404)/10 + 1 = (80)/10 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, 9 4's in the units place for 400-488.\n\nSo, total 4's in the units place for three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. For 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs at 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, correct.\n\nSo, total 4's in units place for three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but hold on, 100-199: 10 4's in units place. 200-299: 10. 300-399: 10. 400-488: 9. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89 + 40 = 129 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, but let me check: hundreds place is 89, tens is 40, units is 39. So, 89 + 40 = 129, plus 39 is 168. So, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 168.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 168\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 = 20, plus 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in single-digit, it's 1.\n\nTwo-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nThree-digit: hundreds (89) + tens (40) + units (39) = 168.\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nHmm, okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: The only single-digit number with an 8 is page 8. So, that's one occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers: Again, tens and units places.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers 80-89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: The digit 8 appears once every ten numbers, like 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the units place.\n\nWait, but 88 is in both the tens and units places. So, when counting, 88 is counted twice, which is correct because it has two 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nNow, three-digit page numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: Let's break it down by hundreds.\n\n1. 100-199: Tens digit 8 is in 180-189. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\n2. 200-299: Tens digit 8 is in 280-289. Another 10.\n\n3. 300-399: Tens digit 8 is in 380-389. Another 10.\n\n4. 400-488: Tens digit 8 is in 480-488. Wait, 480-488: how many numbers is that? 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers. So, 9 8's in the tens place for 400-488.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nUnits place: Again, by hundreds.\n\n1. 100-199: Units digit 8 occurs at 108, 118, 128, 138, 148, 158, 168, 178, 188, 198. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\n2. 200-299: 208, 218, ..., 298. Another 10.\n\n3. 300-399: 308, 318, ..., 398. Another 10.\n\n4. 400-488: Units digit 8 occurs at 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers because after 488, the next would be 498, which is beyond 488.\n\nSo, units place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but let me check 400-488 for units digit 8: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. Yes, that's 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total 8's in the units place for three-digit numbers: 39.\n\nTherefore, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place (39) + units place (39) = 78.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 78\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 = 20, plus 78 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188\n\nTotal 8's: 98\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that's a big difference. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTens place: For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), 10 each for the first three, and 10 for 400-488, so 10+10+10+10=40.\n\nWait, earlier I thought 400-488's tens place 4's were 10, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so yes, 10. So, 40 in total.\n\nUnits place: 10 for each of the first three hundreds, and 9 for 400-488, so 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168 in three-digit numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 1+19+168=188.\n\n8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19\n\nThree-digit:\n\nTens place: 10+10+10+9=39\n\nUnits place:10+10+10+9=39\n\nTotal three-digit 8's:39+39=78\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: from 1 to 9. The only single-digit number with a 4 is 4 itself. So, that's 1 occurrence of the digit 4.\n\nNext, for two-digit page numbers: from 10 to 99. Here, the digit 4 can appear in the tens place or the units place. Let me calculate each separately.\n\nIn the tens place: The numbers are 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nIn the units place: The numbers are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, but wait, 44 has two 4's. However, since I'm counting each occurrence, 44 contributes two 4's, but in the units place, it's only one. Wait, no, actually, each number contributes one 4 in the units place, except 44, which would have two 4's, but in the units place, it's just one. So, actually, there are 9 numbers where the units digit is 4, each contributing one 4, so that's 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 10 to 99, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each ten (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 tens (10-99), so that's 9 times. But wait, from 10 to 99, that's 90 numbers, so 9 tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 9 occurrences. But wait, 40-49 is a separate case where 4 is in the tens place, which we've already counted as 10 occurrences. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19.\n\nWait, but hold on, 44 is included in both counts. When I count the tens place, 44 is counted once, and when I count the units place, 44 is counted again. So, in total, 44 contributes two 4's, which is correct because it has two 4's. So, that's fine.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because now we have hundreds, tens, and units places. Let me break it down by each digit position.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit goes from 1 to 4. Let's see how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That would be from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences of 4.\n\nNext, the tens place: We need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens digit across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488. Let's think about this. For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149 in the 100s, 240-249 in the 200s, etc.). \n\nBut wait, the last hundred is 400-488, so the tens digit goes up to 8. So, in 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8, so 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 440-449. So, in each of the first three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each. That's 3 * 10 = 30. Then, in 400-488, it's another 10 times (440-449). So, total in the tens place: 30 + 10 = 40.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. For 100-199: 140-149 is 10 numbers. Similarly for 200-299: 240-249, and 300-399: 340-349. Each gives 10 numbers. Then, 400-488: 440-449 is 10 numbers. So yes, 4 hundreds, but the first three contribute 10 each, and the fourth contributes 10 as well, but wait, 400-488 is only up to 488, but 440-449 is within that range, so yes, 10 numbers. So total tens place: 4 * 10 = 40. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds are 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's four groups. Each of the first three groups has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, and the last group (400-488) also has 10 numbers (440-449). So, total 40 occurrences.\n\nNow, the units place: Similarly, for each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the units place for 10 numbers. Let's check each hundred:\n\n100-199: 104,114,124,...,194. That's 10 numbers.\n200-299: 204,214,...,294. 10 numbers.\n300-399: 304,...,394. 10 numbers.\n400-488: 404,414,...,484. Let's see, from 400 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. So, in 400-488, the units digit 4 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total units place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the last part. From 400 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, starting at 400, the first number ending with 4 is 404, then 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. The next would be 494, but 494 is beyond 488, so we stop at 484. So, that's 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 occurrences in the units place for 400-488.\n\nSo, total units place for 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\nTwo-digit: 19\nThree-digit: hundreds (89) + tens (40) + units (39) = 89 + 40 = 129; 129 + 39 = 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) = 20, plus 168 (three-digit) = 188. So, 188 occurrences of the digit 4.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: from 1 to 9. The only single-digit number with an 8 is 8 itself. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers: from 10 to 99.\n\nIn the tens place: The numbers are 80-89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nIn the units place: The numbers are 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, but 88 has two 8's. However, in the units place, each occurrence is counted once per number. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nWait, but similar to the 4's, 88 is included in both counts. So, in the tens place, 88 is counted once, and in the units place, 88 is counted once, so total two 8's in 88, which is correct.\n\nNow, three-digit page numbers: from 100 to 488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens digit from 100 to 488.\n\nFor each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 180-189 in the 100s, 280-289 in the 200s, etc.).\n\nBut let's check each hundred:\n\n100-199: 180-189, which is 10 numbers.\n200-299: 280-289, 10 numbers.\n300-399: 380-389, 10 numbers.\n400-488: The tens digit can go up to 8, so 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the 400-488 group, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place:\n\n100-199: 10\n200-299: 10\n300-399: 10\n400-488: 9\nTotal: 10+10+10+9 = 39.\n\nNow, units place: Similarly, for each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, the digit 8 appears in the units place for 10 numbers. Let's check each hundred:\n\n100-199: 108,118,128,...,198. That's 10 numbers.\n200-299: 208,...,298. 10 numbers.\n300-399: 308,...,398. 10 numbers.\n400-488: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Let's count: starting at 408, each 10 numbers. So, 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so we stop at 488. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total units place:\n\n100-199:10\n200-299:10\n300-399:10\n400-488:9\nTotal: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\nTwo-digit:19\nThree-digit: tens (39) + units (39) = 78\nTotal 8's:1 +19 +78=98.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 1 (single) +19 (two-digit)=20, plus 78 (three-digit)=98.\n\nSo, total 4's:188\nTotal 8's:98\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes it's easy to miscount.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\nTwo-digit:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19\nThree-digit: hundreds (89) + tens (40) + units (39)=168\nTotal:1+19+168=188\n\nFor 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\nTwo-digit:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19\nThree-digit: tens (39) + units (39)=78\nTotal:1+19+78=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit pages: Only page 4 has a 4, so that's 1 occurrence.\n\nNow, moving on to two-digit pages: The tens place can be from 1 to 9, and the units place can be from 0 to 9. So, for the tens place, the number 40-49 will each have a 4 in the tens digit. That's 10 occurrences (from 40 to 49). For the units place, in each set of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the 4 appears once in the units place. Since there are 9 sets (10-19 up to 90-99), that's 9 occurrences. So, total two-digit 4's are 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nNext, for three-digit pages: The hundreds place can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's break this down:\n\n- Hundreds place: For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place only in the 400-488 range. The number of 4's here is 89 (from 400 to 488 inclusive, which is 89 numbers). Wait, actually, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, that's 89 occurrences.\n\n- Tens place: In each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, for each hundred, the number of times 4 appears in the tens place is 10 times (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). Since there are 4 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), but wait, 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so the tens place in 400-488 goes up to 8 in the tens digit (since 488 is the last page). So, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total tens place 4's are 10 (from 100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40.\n\n- Units place: Similarly, in each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9, so each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 in the units place. But again, in 400-488, the units digit goes up to 8 in 488, so the units digit 4 occurs in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times. Wait, let me check: from 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs every 10 numbers, so starting at 404, then 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times. So, total units place 4's are 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nSo, total three-digit 4's are 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the three-digit counts.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place for three-digit numbers, from 100-399, each hundred contributes 100 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3. So, the 4 in the hundreds place only occurs from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nFor the tens place, in each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times each (e.g., 140-149, etc.), so that's 10 per hundred, times 3 hundreds, which is 30. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 more. So, total tens place 4's are 30 + 10 = 40. That's correct.\n\nFor the units place, in each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the units digit 4 occurs 10 times each (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194; same for others). So, 10 per hundred times 3 hundreds is 30. Then, in 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs 9 times, as earlier. So, total units place 4's are 30 + 9 = 39. So, total three-digit 4's are 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. That seems correct.\n\nNow, for two-digit numbers, the tens place 4's are 10 (40-49), and units place 4's are 9 (4, 14, 24, ..., 84). Wait, wait, earlier I thought two-digit numbers go from 10-99, so units digit 4's are from 14,24,...,94, which is 9 numbers, right? So, 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. That's correct.\n\nSingle-digit: only 4, so 1.\n\nSo total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nSingle-digit: only page 8, so 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: tens place 8's are 10 (80-89). Units place 8's are 9 (8,18,28,...,88). So, total two-digit 8's: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nThree-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 8's can only appear in the hundreds place if the page number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\n- Tens place: In each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit 8 occurs 10 times each. So, for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, that's 10 each, so 30. For 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times? Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 for all numbers from 480 to 489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39.\n\n- Units place: In each hundred, the units digit 8 occurs 10 times. So, for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, that's 10 each, so 30. For 400-488, the units digit 8 occurs in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 times. So, total units place 8's: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, total three-digit 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\nAdding up all 8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) = 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check the three-digit 8's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, correct.\n\n- Tens place: 100-399: 3 hundreds, each with 10 8's in tens place, so 30. 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in tens place. Total 39.\n\n- Units place: 100-399: 3 hundreds, each with 10 8's in units place, so 30. 400-488: 408,418,...,488: that's 9 numbers, so 9. Total 39.\n\nSo, 39 + 39 = 78. Correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to miscount.\n\nLet me recheck the three-digit 4's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has 10 4's in tens place, so 3*10=30. Plus 440-449 in 400-488: 10 4's. So, 30 +10=40.\n\n- Units place: Each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has 10 4's in units place, so 3*10=30. In 400-488, units digit 4 occurs at 404,414,...,484. From 404 to 484, that's 9 numbers (since 484 is the 9th occurrence). So, 30 +9=39.\n\nTotal 4's: 89+40+39=168. Plus single and two-digit: 1+19=20. So, 168+20=188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\n- Tens place: 100-399: 3 hundreds, each with 10 8's, so 30. 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9. Total 39.\n\n- Units place: 100-399: 3 hundreds, each with 10 8's, so 30. 400-488: 408,418,...,488: 9 numbers. So, 30+9=39.\n\nTotal 8's: 39+39=78. Plus single and two-digit: 1+19=20. So, 78+20=98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting the units digit in 400-488 for 4's, I counted 9 numbers, but 404,414,...,484 is 9 numbers because 404 is the first, and each step is 10, so 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place in 400-488, it's 408,418,...,488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, I think the counts are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let me count the number of 4's in the units place. For single-digit pages, the only 4 is page 4, so that's 1 occurrence. For two-digit pages, from 10 to 99, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each set of 10 numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 sets of 10 in the two-digit numbers (10-99), so that's 9 occurrences of 4 in the units place. But wait, from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of 10, so yes, 9 times. But actually, when I think about it, from 10 to 99, the units digit cycles 0-9 nine times, so each digit from 0-9 appears 9 times in the units place. So, 4 appears 9 times in the units place for two-digit numbers. Then, for three-digit numbers, from 100 to 488, the units digit again cycles every 10 numbers. Let me figure out how many sets of 10 there are in 100-488. 488 - 100 + 1 = 389 pages. Wait, but that's the total count. Maybe a better approach is to consider each hundred separately. From 100-199: 100 numbers. The units digit cycles 0-9 ten times, so 4 appears 10 times in the units place. Similarly, from 200-299: another 10 times. From 300-399: another 10 times. Now, from 400-488: the units digit cycles from 0-8, so how many times does 4 appear? Let's see, from 400-409: 4 appears once. 410-419: once, 420-429: once, 430-439: once, 440-449: once, 450-459: once, 460-469: once, 470-479: once, 480-488: once. Wait, that's 9 sets, but actually, from 400-488, the units digit cycles 9 times (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, let me think again. From 400-488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 8 complete sets of 10 (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-489, but since we stop at 488, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers instead of 10). So, in each of the first 8 sets (400-409 up to 470-479), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. Then, in 480-488, the units digit goes from 0 to 8, so 4 appears once. So, that's 9 occurrences in the units place for 400-488. Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place from 100-488 is 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times. So, total 4's in units place: single-digit (1) + two-digit (9) + three-digit (39) = 1 + 9 + 39 = 49.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 4's in the tens place. For single-digit pages, there's no tens place, so 0. For two-digit pages (10-99), the tens digit is 4 for pages 40-49. That's 10 occurrences (40,41,...,49). So, 10 times. For three-digit pages, let's look at each hundred. From 100-199: the tens digit is 4 for pages 140-149, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. Now, 400-488: the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449, but wait, 440-449 would be within 400-488, right? So, that's another 10. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, 10 occurrences. So, from 100-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 times. So, total 4's in tens place: 10 (two-digit) + 40 (three-digit) = 50.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me check again. For three-digit numbers, from 100-199, the tens digit is 4 for 140-149, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10 times. 300-399: 340-349, 10 times. Now, 400-488: the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so another 10. So, total 40 times in the tens place. But wait, from 400-488, does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 10 times. So, total 4's in tens place: 10 (two-digit) + 40 (three-digit) = 50.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 4's in the hundreds place. For single-digit and two-digit pages, there's no hundreds place, so 0. For three-digit pages, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, 89 occurrences.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me recount each part.\n\nUnits place:\n- Single-digit: 1 (page 4)\n- Two-digit: 9 (4,14,24,...,84) \u2192 Wait, no, in two-digit numbers, from 10-99, the units digit 4 appears 9 times? Wait, no, from 10-99, the units digit cycles 0-9 nine times, so 4 appears 9 times. Wait, but 10-99 is 90 numbers, so 9 sets of 10, each digit appears 9 times in the units place. So, 9 times. So, units place: 1 + 9 = 10 so far.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 49, which included three-digit numbers. Wait, perhaps I confused the counts. Let me try a different approach. Maybe it's better to separate the counts for each digit place.\n\nLet me approach it systematically:\n\n1. Units digit:\n   - Pages 1-9: 1 occurrence (page 4)\n   - Pages 10-99: Each ten has one 4 in the units place, so 9 tens (10-99) \u2192 9 occurrences\n   - Pages 100-488: Each ten has one 4 in the units place. How many tens are there from 100-488?\n     - From 100-199: 10 occurrences (104,114,...,194)\n     - From 200-299: 10\n     - From 300-399: 10\n     - From 400-488: Let's see, 400-488 is 89 pages. The units digit cycles every 10, so how many complete sets of 10 are there? 8 complete sets (400-409, 410-419,...,480-489), but since we stop at 488, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in each of the 8 complete sets, 4 appears once in the units place, and in the last incomplete set, 4 appears once (484). So, 8 + 1 = 9 occurrences.\n   - So, total units digit 4's: 1 (single) + 9 (two-digit) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 1 + 9 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 59.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier count. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake before. Let me confirm. From 100-199: 10 occurrences, same for 200-299 and 300-399. From 400-488, as I thought, 9 occurrences. So, units digit: 1 + 9 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 59.\n\n2. Tens digit:\n   - Pages 1-9: no tens digit, so 0.\n   - Pages 10-99: the tens digit is 4 for pages 40-49, which is 10 occurrences.\n   - Pages 100-199: the tens digit is 4 for pages 140-149, 10 occurrences.\n   - Pages 200-299: 240-249, 10.\n   - Pages 300-399: 340-349, 10.\n   - Pages 400-488: the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449, which is 10 occurrences (since 440-449 is within 400-488).\n   - So, total tens digit 4's: 10 (two-digit) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 50.\n\n3. Hundreds digit:\n   - Pages 1-99: no hundreds digit, so 0.\n   - Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's.\n   - Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, no 4's.\n   - Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, no 4's.\n   - Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so how many numbers? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (59) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 59 + 50 = 109 + 89 = 198.\n\nWait, that's a different total than before. Hmm, I must be making a mistake somewhere. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I overcounted in the units digit for three-digit numbers. Let me recount the units digit:\n\nFrom 100-199: 10 occurrences (104,114,...,194)\nFrom 200-299: 10\nFrom 300-399: 10\nFrom 400-488: Let's see, 400-488 is 89 pages. The units digit cycles every 10, so how many times does 4 appear? For each ten, once. So, from 400-409: 404\n410-419: 414\n420-429: 424\n430-439: 434\n440-449: 444\n450-459: 454\n460-469: 464\n470-479: 474\n480-488: 484\nSo, that's 9 occurrences. So, units digit from 400-488: 9.\n\nSo, total units digit 4's: 1 (single) + 9 (two-digit) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 1 + 9 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 59.\n\nTens digit: 10 (two-digit) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 50.\n\nHundreds digit: 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 59 + 50 + 89 = 198.\n\nWait, but I think I'm making a mistake because in the hundreds digit, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 pages, so that's correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nFirst, units digit:\n\n- Pages 1-9: 1 occurrence (page 8)\n- Pages 10-99: Each ten has one 8 in the units place, so 9 occurrences (18,28,...,88)\n- Pages 100-488: Each ten has one 8 in the units place. Let's calculate how many:\n\nFrom 100-199: 10 occurrences (108,118,...,198)\nFrom 200-299: 10\nFrom 300-399: 10\nFrom 400-488: Let's see, 400-488. The units digit cycles every 10, so how many times does 8 appear? For each ten, once. So:\n\n400-409: 408\n410-419: 418\n420-429: 428\n430-439: 438\n440-449: 448\n450-459: 458\n460-469: 468\n470-479: 478\n480-488: 488\nSo, that's 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total units digit 8's: 1 (single) + 9 (two-digit) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 1 + 9 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 59.\n\nTens digit:\n\n- Pages 1-99: The tens digit is 8 for pages 80-89, which is 10 occurrences.\n- Pages 100-199: The tens digit is 8 for pages 180-189, 10 occurrences.\n- Pages 200-299: 280-289, 10.\n- Pages 300-399: 380-389, 10.\n- Pages 400-488: The tens digit is 8 for pages 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's pages 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens digit 8's: 10 (two-digit) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds digit:\n\n- Pages 1-99: no hundreds digit, so 0.\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, no 8's.\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, no 8's.\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, no 8's.\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, no 8's.\nSo, hundreds digit 8's: 0.\n\nTotal number of 8's: units (59) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 59 + 49 = 108.\n\nWait, so total 4's are 198 and 8's are 108. So, the difference is 198 - 108 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 198 and 8's 108, so 90 more 4's. But let me check if I did this correctly.\n\nWait, but when I counted 4's, I had:\n\nUnits: 59\nTens: 50\nHundreds: 89\nTotal: 59 + 50 + 89 = 198.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits: 59\nTens: 49\nHundreds: 0\nTotal: 59 + 49 = 108.\n\nSo, 198 - 108 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I think I might have overcounted in the hundreds digit for 4's. Let me confirm: from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 pages, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, the hundreds digit is never 8 in the book, since the book ends at 488, so no page 800-899, so correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens digit for 8's in 400-488. I said it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 8 in the tens place appears 9 times. That seems correct.\n\nSo, yes, 4's: 198, 8's: 108, difference 90.\n\nWait, but earlier when I first did the 4's count, I thought 4's were 198, but I'm now getting the same result again, so maybe it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the units digit for 4's. Let me recount units digit for 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 4)\nTwo-digit: 9 (14,24,...,84)\nThree-digit:\n100-199: 10 (104,114,...,194)\n200-299: 10\n300-399: 10\n400-488: 9 (404,414,...,484)\nTotal: 1 + 9 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 59.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTens digit for 4's: 10 (two-digit) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 50.\n\nHundreds digit: 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 59 + 50 + 89 = 198.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits digit: 1 (page 8) + 9 (18,28,...,88) + 10 (108,118,...,198) + 10 (208,218,...,298) + 10 (308,318,...,398) + 9 (408,418,...,488) = 1 + 9 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 59.\n\nTens digit: 10 (80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds digit: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 59 + 49 = 108.\n\nSo, 198 - 108 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about it, I thought the difference would be 90, but I wanted to make sure I didn't miss anything. I think this is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 198, and the number of 8's is 108. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: from 1 to 9. The only single-digit page that has a 4 is page 4 itself. So, that's 1 occurrence of the digit 4. \n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers: from 10 to 99. Here, the digit 4 can appear in the tens place or the ones place. Let me consider each case separately. \n\nFor the tens place: The pages where the tens digit is 4 are from 40 to 49. That's 10 pages, each contributing one 4 in the tens place. So, that's 10 occurrences. \n\nFor the ones place: The pages where the ones digit is 4 are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but from 10 to 99, that's every 10 pages. So, starting at 14, adding 10 each time until we reach 94. Let me count them: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 pages, each contributing a 4 in the ones place. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, right? So, in 44, the tens and ones digits are both 4. So, when I count the tens place, I already counted the 4 in the tens digit of 44, and now I'm counting the 4 in the ones digit. So, 44 contributes two 4's, but I should make sure I'm not double-counting. Wait, no, because when I count the tens place, I'm counting all the 4's in the tens digit, including 44, and when I count the ones place, I'm counting all the 4's in the ones digit, including 44. So, 44 will be counted twice, once in each category. But that's correct because 44 has two 4's. So, in total, for the two-digit numbers, the number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (ones place) = 19? Wait, no, wait. From 10 to 99, the ones digits cycle every 10 numbers, so from 10 to 99, how many times does 4 appear in the ones place? Let's see: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the ones place. So, 9 occurrences. But wait, 44 is included in both counts, but that's okay because it has two 4's. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 19. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. From 10 to 99, the tens digits go from 1 to 9, and for each tens digit, there's one 4 in the ones place. So, for each of the 9 tens digits (1-9), there's one 4 in the ones place, so that's 9 times. But wait, from 40 to 49, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. So, 10 times. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 19. That seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: from 100 to 488. Here, the digit 4 can appear in the hundreds place, tens place, or ones place. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, let's consider each case.\n\nFor hundreds digit = 1: Pages from 100 to 199. How many 4's are there in the hundreds place? None, because the hundreds digit is 1. So, zero.\n\nFor hundreds digit = 2: Pages from 200 to 299. Similarly, hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's in the hundreds place. Zero.\n\nFor hundreds digit = 3: Pages from 300 to 399. Hundreds digit is 3, so again, no 4's in the hundreds place. Zero.\n\nFor hundreds digit = 4: Pages from 400 to 488. Here, the hundreds digit is 4, so every page from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 pages contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences.\n\nNow, let's consider the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9, and we're looking for where the digit 4 appears in the tens place. We need to consider each hundred separately.\n\nFor hundreds digit = 1: Pages 100-199. The tens digit can be 0-9. So, the pages where the tens digit is 4 are 140-149. That's 10 pages, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. So, 10 occurrences.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digit = 2: Pages 200-299. The tens digit 4 occurs in 240-249. Another 10 pages, so 10 occurrences.\n\nFor hundreds digit = 3: Pages 300-399. The tens digit 4 occurs in 340-349. Another 10 pages, so 10 occurrences.\n\nFor hundreds digit = 4: Pages 400-488. The tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 440-449 is within that range. That's 10 pages, so 10 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place across all three-digit numbers: 10 (hundreds=1) + 10 (hundreds=2) + 10 (hundreds=3) + 10 (hundreds=4) = 40 occurrences.\n\nNow, let's consider the ones place in three-digit numbers. The ones digit cycles from 0-9 for each combination of hundreds and tens digits. So, for each hundred, each ten, there's a page ending with 4.\n\nLet's break it down by hundreds:\n\nFor hundreds digit = 1: Pages 100-199. The ones digit is 4 in 104,114,124,134,144,154,164,174,184,194. That's 10 pages, so 10 occurrences.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digit = 2: Pages 200-299. The ones digit 4 occurs in 204,214,224,234,244,254,264,274,284,294. Another 10 occurrences.\n\nFor hundreds digit = 3: Pages 300-399. The ones digit 4 occurs in 304,314,324,334,344,354,364,374,384,394. Another 10 occurrences.\n\nFor hundreds digit = 4: Pages 400-488. The ones digit 4 occurs in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Wait, but 484 is within 488, so that's 9 pages, right? Because from 404, adding 10 each time: 404,414,...,484. Let's count: 404 (1), 414 (2), 424 (3), 434 (4), 444 (5), 454 (6), 464 (7), 474 (8), 484 (9). So, 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds digit 4 case, the ones digit 4 occurs 9 times because the last page is 488, so 484 is the last one with ones digit 4. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 4's in the ones place across all three-digit numbers: 10 (hundreds=1) + 10 (hundreds=2) + 10 (hundreds=3) + 9 (hundreds=4) = 39 occurrences.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 40\n- Ones place: 39\nTotal 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) = 129, plus 39 (ones) = 168. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check the three-digit count. Maybe I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place for three-digit numbers, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred (1,2,3,4), the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times each, so 4*10=40. That seems correct.\n\nIn the ones place, for hundreds 1,2,3, each have 10 occurrences, and for hundreds 4, it's 9. So, 10+10+10+9=39. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168. Then, adding single and two-digit: 1+19=20, plus 168=188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in all page numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit: from 1 to 9. The only single-digit page with an 8 is page 8. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: from 10 to 99. The digit 8 can appear in the tens place or the ones place.\n\nTens place: The pages where the tens digit is 8 are from 80 to 89. That's 10 pages, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, 10 occurrences.\n\nOnes place: The pages where the ones digit is 8 are 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 pages, each contributing an 8 in the ones place. Wait, but 88 has both digits as 8, so it's counted twice, but that's correct because it has two 8's. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 19.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers: from 100 to 488.\n\nLet's break it down by hundreds, tens, and ones places.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. We're looking for where the hundreds digit is 8, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: The tens digit can be 0-9. Let's consider each hundred.\n\nFor hundreds digit = 1: Pages 100-199. The tens digit 8 occurs in 180-189. That's 10 pages, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, 10 occurrences.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digit = 2: Pages 200-299. Tens digit 8 occurs in 280-289. Another 10 occurrences.\n\nFor hundreds digit = 3: Pages 300-399. Tens digit 8 occurs in 380-389. Another 10 occurrences.\n\nFor hundreds digit = 4: Pages 400-488. Tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place across all three-digit numbers: 10 (hundreds=1) + 10 (hundreds=2) + 10 (hundreds=3) + 9 (hundreds=4) = 39 occurrences.\n\nNow, ones place in three-digit numbers. The ones digit is 8 in pages where the last digit is 8. Let's consider each hundred.\n\nFor hundreds digit = 1: Pages 100-199. The ones digit 8 occurs in 108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198. That's 10 pages, so 10 occurrences.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digit = 2: Pages 200-299. Ones digit 8 occurs in 208,218,228,238,248,258,268,278,288,298. Another 10 occurrences.\n\nFor hundreds digit = 3: Pages 300-399. Ones digit 8 occurs in 308,318,328,338,348,358,368,378,388,398. Another 10 occurrences.\n\nFor hundreds digit = 4: Pages 400-488. Ones digit 8 occurs in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Wait, let's count these. From 408, adding 10 each time: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's in the ones place across all three-digit numbers: 10 (hundreds=1) + 10 (hundreds=2) + 10 (hundreds=3) + 9 (hundreds=4) = 39 occurrences.\n\nNow, summing up all the 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Tens place: 39\n- Ones place: 39\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Tens place was 39, ones place was 39, so total 78. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me double-check:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 8)\nTwo-digit: 10 (tens) +9 (ones) =19\nThree-digit: tens=39, ones=39, total=78\nTotal 8's: 1+19+78=98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's.\n\nNumber of 4's: 188\nNumber of 8's: 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 4)\nTwo-digit: tens=10 (40-49), ones=9 (14,24,...,94) \u2192 total 19\nThree-digit:\n- Hundreds: 89 (400-488)\n- Tens: 40 (10 each for hundreds 1,2,3,4)\n- Ones: 39 (10 each for hundreds 1,2,3; 9 for hundreds 4)\nTotal three-digit 4's: 89+40+39=168\nTotal 4's: 1+19+168=188\n\n8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 8)\nTwo-digit: tens=10 (80-89), ones=9 (18,28,...,98) \u2192 total 19\nThree-digit:\n- Tens: 10 (hundreds=1) +10 (hundreds=2) +10 (hundreds=3) +9 (hundreds=4) =39\n- Ones: 10 (hundreds=1) +10 (hundreds=2) +10 (hundreds=3) +9 (hundreds=4) =39\nTotal three-digit 8's: 39+39=78\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I double-counted some numbers, especially in the three-digit section. For example, in the three-digit numbers, when I counted the hundreds place for 4's, I included all pages from 400-488, which is correct. Similarly, in the tens and ones places, I considered each hundred separately and added accordingly. It seems correct.\n\nAnother way to check is to calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately and see if the difference makes sense. Since 4 is a lower digit, it's possible that it appears more frequently, especially in the hundreds place where it runs from 400-488, contributing a lot of 4's. So, a difference of 90 might be plausible.\n\nWait, but let me think about another approach. Maybe using a formula or a more systematic way to count digits.\n\nFor any digit d, the number of times it appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) can be calculated separately.\n\nLet me try that for 4's:\n\nUnits place:\n\nIn each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That's 48 occurrences. But wait, the last partial set is 481-488, which includes 484, so that's an extra occurrence. So, total units place 4's: 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I counted 39 in three-digit numbers. Hmm, there's a discrepancy here. Let me see where I went wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the counts. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades plus any extra in the incomplete decade.\n\nNumber of complete decades: floor(488/10)=48. Each contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48.\n\nNow, the incomplete decade is from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers. The units digits here are 1-8, so 484 is included, which is one more 4. So, total units place 4's: 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\nThe digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 occurrences in the tens place. So, for hundreds 0,1,2,3,4 (since we go up to 488), but let's see:\n\nWait, actually, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers.\n\nFrom 100-199: 140-149 \u219210 numbers.\n\nFrom 200-299:240-249\u219210 numbers.\n\nFrom 300-399:340-349\u219210 numbers.\n\nFrom 400-488:440-449\u219210 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. But 488 is beyond 449, so we have 10 numbers there.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 5 sets \u00d710=50.\n\nWait, but earlier I counted 40 in the three-digit numbers and 10 in the two-digit numbers, totaling 50. So, that's consistent.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nThe digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. That's 488 -400 +1=89 numbers.\n\nSo, total hundreds place 4's:89.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That matches my earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, let's apply this method to count the number of 8's.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of times 8 appears in the units place from 1 to 488.\n\nEach set of 10 numbers contributes one 8 in the units place. So, number of complete sets: floor(488/10)=48, contributing 48 occurrences.\n\nThe incomplete set is 481-488, which includes 488, so units digit 8 occurs once more. So, total units place 8's:48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nThe digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers.\n\nFrom 0-99:80-89\u219210 numbers.\n\nFrom 100-199:180-189\u219210 numbers.\n\nFrom 200-299:280-289\u219210 numbers.\n\nFrom 300-399:380-389\u219210 numbers.\n\nFrom 400-488:480-488\u21929 numbers (since 488 is the last page).\n\nSo, total tens place 8's:10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nThe digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but since our book ends at 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, zero.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each set of 10 numbers contributes one '4'.\n   - Total complete sets: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n   - Partial set (481-488) includes 484, adding one more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 '4's in the tens place.\n   - From 0-99: 10 (40-49).\n   - From 100-199: 10 (140-149).\n   - From 200-299: 10 (240-249).\n   - From 300-399: 10 (340-349).\n   - From 400-488: 10 (440-449).\n   - Total: 10 \u00d7 5 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages 400-488: 89 pages.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each set of 10 numbers contributes one '8'.\n   - Total complete sets: 48.\n   - Partial set (481-488) includes 488, adding one more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 '8's in the tens place.\n   - From 0-99: 10 (80-89).\n   - From 100-199: 10 (180-189).\n   - From 200-299: 10 (280-289).\n   - From 300-399: 10 (380-389).\n   - From 400-488: 9 (480-488).\n   - Total: 10 \u00d7 4 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages have '8' in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: The only single-digit page with a 4 is page 4. So that's one 4. Now, moving on to two-digit numbers. For two-digit numbers, the tens place can be from 1 to 9, and the units place can be from 0 to 9. So, in the tens place, the number 4 appears in 40-49. That's 10 times. In the units place, the number 4 appears in every 10 numbers, like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, so I need to make sure I count each occurrence. From 1 to 99, how many 4's are there? Let me think: in the units place, there's one 4 in each set of ten, so 10 times (14,24,...,94). But wait, from 10-99, that's 9 sets of ten, so actually, 9 times in the units place? Wait, no, 10-99 is 90 numbers, so 9 sets of ten, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 9 times. But wait, page 4 is single-digit, so from 1-99, the units place has 9 4's and the tens place has 10 4's (40-49). So total from 1-99, it's 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 4's. But wait, page 4 is single-digit, so from 1-9, it's one 4. Then from 10-99, it's 19 4's. So total from 1-99, 1 + 19 = 20 4's? Wait, that doesn't seem right because 10-99 has 90 numbers, so units place: 9 4's (14,24,...,94), and tens place: 10 4's (40-49). So 10 + 9 = 19 4's from 10-99, plus 1 from 1-9, so total 20 4's from 1-99. Okay, that makes sense.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers. Pages 100-488. Let's break this down into hundreds, tens, and units places. \n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit goes from 1 to 4. So, for the hundreds place, how many 4's are there? Pages 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, there are 89 4's. \n\nNext, the tens place. For three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 0-9, and similarly for the units digit. We need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers up to 488. \n\nLet's consider the hundreds digit from 1 to 4. \n\n- When hundreds digit is 1: The tens digit cycles from 0-9 for each hundred. So, for each hundred, the tens digit is 4 once every ten numbers. So, for 100-199, the tens digit is 4 in 140-149, which is 10 times. Similarly, for hundreds digit 2, 3, and 4, the same applies. \n\nWait, but for hundreds digit 4, we only go up to 488, so the tens digit can't go beyond 8 in the tens place. Let me clarify. \n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: The tens digit can be 0-9, so for each hundred, the number of 4's in the tens place is 10 (e.g., 140-149). \n\nFor hundreds digit 4: The tens digit can only go up to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? It's from 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, 440-449 would be pages 440 to 449, but since the book goes up to 488, 440-449 is within the range. So, that's 10 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, 10 times. So, for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: 10 each, so 3 * 10 = 30. For hundreds digit 4: 10. So total 40 4's in the tens place across all three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. For hundreds digit 1: 140-149: 10 4's. Similarly for 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 4 sets of 10, totaling 40 4's in the tens place. \n\nNow, the units place. Similarly, for each hundreds digit, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, for each hundred, the units digit is 4 once every ten numbers. So, for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, and 4, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each has 10 occurrences in the units place (e.g., 104,114,...,194 for 100-199). So, 10 per hundred, times 3 hundreds: 30.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: The units digit cycles 0-9, but we only go up to 488. So, the units digit 4 appears in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place for hundreds digit 4? Let's see: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times because 404 to 484 is 9 numbers (since 484 - 404 = 80, but divided by 10, so 9 times). Wait, but 404 is the first, then every 10 pages. So, from 404 to 484, that's (484 - 404)/10 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 times. So, 9 4's in the units place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo total units place 4's: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: For hundreds digits 1,2,3: Each has 10 units place 4's, so 3*10=30. For hundreds digit 4: From 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's list them:\n\n404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total units place 4's: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers:\n\nHundreds place: 89 (from 400-488)\n\nTens place: 40 (from 140-149, etc.)\n\nUnits place: 39\n\nTotal 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nNow, adding the 4's from single-digit and two-digit numbers:\n\nFrom 1-99: 20 4's\n\nFrom 100-488: 168 4's\n\nTotal 4's: 20 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the three-digit counts because that seems a bit high. Let me recount:\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 4's in hundreds place.\n\nTens place: For each hundred (1,2,3,4), the tens digit is 4 in 10 numbers each. So, 4 hundreds, but wait, for hundreds digit 4, does the tens digit go up to 8? Wait, no, the tens digit in the three-digit numbers is separate from the hundreds digit. So, for hundreds digit 1, the tens digit can be 0-9, so 140-149: 10 4's. Similarly for hundreds digits 2,3,4. So, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place: 4*10=40. But wait, for hundreds digit 4, the tens digit can go up to 8 because the book ends at 488. So, for hundreds digit 4, the tens digit can be 0-8, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 4's in the tens place for hundreds digit 4. So, yes, 4*10=40.\n\nUnits place: For hundreds digits 1,2,3: Each has 10 4's in units place. For hundreds digit 4: 9 4's as calculated. So, 3*10 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. That seems correct.\n\nNow, total 4's: 20 + 168 = 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: The only single-digit page with an 8 is page 8. So that's one 8.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: Similar to 4's, but let's go through it.\n\nIn the units place: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the units place.\n\nIn the tens place: 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nBut wait, page 88 has two 8's, so in the tens place, 80-89: 10 8's, and in the units place, 18,28,...,98: 9 8's. So total from 10-99: 10 + 9 = 19 8's.\n\nAdding the single-digit 8: total 8's from 1-99: 1 + 19 = 20.\n\nNow, three-digit numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, how many 8's in the hundreds place? None, because the hundreds digit is 1,2,3,4, none of which are 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: For each hundreds digit (1,2,3,4), the tens digit can be 0-9. So, for each hundred, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, for hundreds digits 1,2,3,4: each contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4*10=40.\n\nUnits place: For each hundreds digit, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, for each hundred, the units digit is 8 once every ten numbers. So, for hundreds digits 1,2,3,4: each has 10 8's in the units place, but wait, for hundreds digit 4, we only go up to 488, so let's check.\n\nFor hundreds digits 1,2,3: Each has 10 units place 8's (e.g., 108,118,...,198 for 100-199). So, 3*10=30.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: The units digit is 8 in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place for hundreds digit 4? Let's count: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 8's.\n\nSo, total units place 8's: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nTherefore, total 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\nTens place: 40\n\nUnits place: 39\n\nTotal: 40 + 39 = 79.\n\nAdding the 8's from 1-99: 20.\n\nTotal 8's: 20 + 79 = 99.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the three-digit counts for 8's.\n\nTens place: For each hundred (1,2,3,4), the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, 4*10=40.\n\nUnits place: For hundreds digits 1,2,3: Each has 10 units place 8's. For hundreds digit 4: From 408 to 488, stepping by 10: 408,418,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 units place 8's.\n\nSo, 3*10 + 9 = 39.\n\nThus, 40 + 39 = 79 in three-digit numbers. Adding 20 from 1-99: 99 total 8's.\n\nNow, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 99 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the counts again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\nFrom 1-99:\n\n- Units place: 14,24,...,94: 9 numbers, but wait, 1-99 includes 94, which is two digits. Wait, no, from 1-99, the units place 4's are 14,24,...,94: that's 9 numbers, right? Because 10-99 is 90 numbers, so 9 sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 9 units place 4's. Then, the tens place: 40-49: 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. So, 10 tens place 4's. Plus the single-digit 4: 4. So total from 1-99: 9 + 10 +1 = 20? Wait, no, the single-digit 4 is part of the 1-9 range, so from 1-99, it's 1 (single-digit) + 9 (units) + 10 (tens) = 20. That's correct.\n\nThree-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\n- Tens place: For each hundred (1,2,3,4), the tens digit is 4 in 140-149, etc., so 10 per hundred. 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40.\n\n- Units place: For hundreds digits 1,2,3: Each has 10 units place 4's. For hundreds digit 4: 404,414,...,484: 9 numbers. So, 3*10 +9=39.\n\nTotal 4's: 89 +40 +39=168. Plus 20 from 1-99: 188. That's correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nFrom 1-99:\n\n- Units place: 18,28,...,98: 9 numbers.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89: 10 numbers.\n\n- Single-digit 8: 8.\n\nSo, 9 +10 +1=20. Correct.\n\nThree-digit numbers:\n\n- Tens place: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place (80-89), so 4*10=40.\n\n- Units place: For hundreds digits 1,2,3: Each has 10 units place 8's. For hundreds digit 4: 408,418,...,488: 9 numbers. So, 3*10 +9=39.\n\nTotal 8's: 40 +39=79. Plus 20 from 1-99: 99. Correct.\n\nSo, difference: 188 -99=89.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the three-digit numbers. For the hundreds digit 4, in the units place, we have 408,418,...,488. That's 9 numbers, right? Because from 408 to 488, stepping by 10: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 units place 8's. So, 3*10=30 from 100-399, plus 9 from 400-488: 39.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the units place, for hundreds digit 4, we have 404,414,...,484: 9 numbers. So, 3*10=30 from 100-399, plus 9 from 400-488: 39.\n\nSo, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 99, so 188 -99=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is 188, and the digit 8 appears 99 times. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: These are from 1 to 9. The only single-digit page number with a 4 is page 4 itself. So, that's one occurrence of the digit 4.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers: These range from 10 to 99. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place.\n\nFor the tens place: The numbers would be 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49. That's 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place. So, that's 10 occurrences.\n\nFor the units place: The numbers would be 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, but since we're counting each occurrence, I should count each 4 separately. So, that's 9 numbers (14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94), each contributing one 4 in the units place, except 44, which has an extra 4 in the tens place. But wait, I've already counted the tens place separately, so for the units place, 44 is included, and it's the only one with two 4's, but I'm only counting the units place here. So, actually, each of these numbers contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 44 is included in both the tens and units counts. So, for the two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19.\n\nWait, but 44 has two 4's, so does that mean I'm double-counting it? Let me think. When I count the tens place, I include 44 as one of the 10 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the tens place. Then, when I count the units place, 44 is again included as one of the 9 numbers, contributing one 4 in the units place. So, yes, 44 is counted twice, which is correct because it has two 4's. So, the total for two-digit numbers is 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: These are from 100 to 488. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. However, for 4 in the hundreds place, the numbers would be 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nNext, the tens place: I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), I can count how many times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nFor 100-199: The tens digit is 4 in the range 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nFor 200-299: Similarly, 240-249, another 10 occurrences.\n\nFor 300-399: 340-349, another 10 occurrences.\n\nFor 400-488: The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. However, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is entirely within 400-488, so that's 10 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit can go up to 8 (since 488). So, the tens digit in 400-488 can be 0-8. So, 440-449 is indeed within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers, contributing 10 occurrences.\n\nSo, in total, the tens place for three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 10 occurrences. So, total tens place 4's in three-digit numbers: 40.\n\nNow, the units place for three-digit numbers: Similarly, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the units place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nFor each hundred, the units digit cycles from 0-9, so in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the units place. Let's break it down:\n\n100-199: The units digit is 4 in 104, 114, 124, 134, 144, 154, 164, 174, 184, 194. That's 10 numbers.\n\n200-299: Similarly, 204, 214, ..., 294. 10 numbers.\n\n300-399: 304, 314, ..., 394. 10 numbers.\n\n400-488: Now, here, the units digit can go up to 8 in the last set (480-488). So, the units digit 4 would appear in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, but 484 is within 400-488, so that's 9 numbers. Wait, let me count:\n\nFrom 400-488, the numbers ending with 4 are 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. Wait, but 404 is the first, then every 10 numbers, so 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, right? Because 400 + 8*10 = 480, and 480 + 4 = 484, which is within 488. So, that's 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but let me check: 404 is 400 + 4, 414 is 410 +4, up to 484. How many terms are there? From 404 to 484, stepping by 10 each time. The number of terms is ((484 - 404)/10) + 1 = (80/10) +1 = 8 +1 = 9. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, for the units place in three-digit numbers:\n\n100-199: 10\n\n200-299: 10\n\n300-399: 10\n\n400-488: 9\n\nTotal: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but I thought each hundred would have 10, but the last hundred only has 9 because it stops at 488. So, total units place 4's in three-digit numbers: 39.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 100-199: 10\n\n200-299: 10\n\n300-399: 10\n\n400-488: 9\n\nTotal: 39.\n\nSo, total number of 4's in three-digit numbers:\n\nHundreds place: 89\n\nTens place: 40\n\nUnits place: 39\n\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 89 + 40 = 129, plus 39 is 168.\n\nSo, total number of 4's in the entire book:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 168\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, single-digit: 1 (page 4)\n\nTwo-digit: 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: 10 (100-199) +10 (200-299) +10 (300-399) +10 (400-449) = 40\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 400-488's tens place for 4's was 10 (440-449). So, that's correct.\n\nUnits place: 10 (100-199) +10 (200-299) +10 (300-399) +9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nAdding single and two-digit: 1 + 19 = 20, plus 168 is 188. So, 188 4's.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nStarting with single-digit: Page 8 is the only single-digit page with an 8. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: Counting 8's in tens and units places.\n\nTens place: Numbers 80-89. That's 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: Numbers where the units digit is 8: 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the units place. Wait, but 88 has two 8's, so in the units place count, we're counting each occurrence. So, 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98: 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nNow, three-digit numbers: Let's count the number of 8's in hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so there are no three-digit numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nTens place: Counting 8's in the tens place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nFor each hundred:\n\n100-199: The tens digit is 8 in 180-189. That's 10 numbers.\n\n200-299: 280-289, another 10.\n\n300-399: 380-389, another 10.\n\n400-488: The tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many of these have an 8 in the tens place? All of them, since the tens digit is 8. So, that's 9 numbers.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\n10 (100-199) +10 (200-299) +10 (300-399) +9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nUnits place: Now, counting 8's in the units place across all three-digit numbers.\n\nFor each hundred:\n\n100-199: Units digit 8 occurs in 108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198. That's 10 numbers.\n\n200-299: Similarly, 208,218,...,298. 10 numbers.\n\n300-399: 308,318,...,398. 10 numbers.\n\n400-488: Units digit 8 occurs in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included, and 408 is the first, then every 10 numbers up to 488. So, 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488: 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total units place 8's:\n\n10 (100-199) +10 (200-299) +10 (300-399) +9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nSo, total number of 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\nTens place: 39\n\nUnits place: 39\n\nHundreds place: 0\n\nTotal: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nWait, but let me check again. For tens place, I had 10+10+10+9=39, and for units place, same. So, 39 +39=78.\n\nNow, adding single and two-digit 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:78\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nWait, so total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems a bit high, but maybe it's correct.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:\n\nTens:10 (40-49)\n\nUnits:9 (14,24,...,94)\n\nTotal two-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds:89 (400-488)\n\nTens:40 (10 occurrences in each of the first three hundreds and 10 in 400-449, but wait earlier I thought it was 10 in 400-488 for tens place, but actually, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 10.\n\nUnits:39 (10 each in first three hundreds, 9 in 400-488)\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168\n\nTotal 4's:1+19+168=188\n\n8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19\n\nThree-digit:\n\nTens:10+10+10+9=39\n\nUnits:10+10+10+9=39\n\nTotal three-digit:39+39=78\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: From 1 to 9, the digit 4 appears once, which is on page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence.\n\nNext, for two-digit page numbers: These range from 10 to 99. I can break this down into two parts: the tens place and the units place. \n\nFor the tens place: The 4 can appear in the tens digit, which would be pages 40-49. That's 10 occurrences (40, 41, ..., 49). \n\nFor the units place: The 4 can appear in the units digit in every set of ten, like 14, 24, 34, 54, ..., 94. From 10-99, there are 9 sets of ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99). In each set, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So that's 9 occurrences.\n\nAdding these together, in two-digit page numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: These are from 100 to 488. Let me consider the hundreds, tens, and units places separately.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in all pages from 400 to 488. That's 89 pages (400-488 inclusive). So, 89 occurrences.\n\nNext, the tens place: Here, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens digit across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488. Let's break this down by hundreds.\n\n- For hundreds digit 1 (100-199): The tens digit cycles from 0-9, so 4 appears in 140-149. That's 10 occurrences.\n- For hundreds digit 2 (200-299): Similarly, 4 appears in 240-249. Another 10 occurrences.\n- For hundreds digit 3 (300-399): 4 appears in 340-349. Another 10 occurrences.\n- For hundreds digit 4 (400-488): The tens digit can go from 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, 4 appears in 440-449. That's 10 occurrences, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, 10 occurrences.\n\nAdding these up: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 occurrences in the tens place.\n\nNow, the units place: Similarly, we count how many times 4 appears in the units digit across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488. Again, breaking it down by hundreds.\n\n- For hundreds digit 1 (100-199): The units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, in each hundred, there are 10 occurrences where the units digit is 4 (like 104, 114, ..., 194). That's 10 occurrences.\n- For hundreds digit 2 (200-299): Similarly, 204, 214, ..., 294. Another 10 occurrences.\n- For hundreds digit 3 (300-399): 304, 314, ..., 394. Another 10 occurrences.\n- For hundreds digit 4 (400-488): The units digit cycles 0-9, but we have to go up to 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place here? Let's see: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 484 exist? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, that's 9 occurrences because from 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten, but the last ten is 480-488, which only goes up to 8 in the units place. So, in 480-488, the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, for hundreds digit 4, how many times does the units digit 4 appear? Let's see: from 400-488, each ten has one 4 in the units place, except the last ten which only goes up to 488. So, how many tens are there? From 400-488, that's 9 tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488). But in the last ten, 480-488, the units digit only goes up to 8, so the 4 in the units place appears once (484). So, that's 9 occurrences in total for the units place in the hundreds digit 4.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. For each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 every ten. So, for hundreds digit 4, from 400-488, how many complete tens are there? From 400-480, that's 9 tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-489). But since we only go up to 488, the last ten is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in each ten, the units digit 4 appears once. So, from 400-488, how many times does the units digit 4 appear? It's once in each ten, except perhaps the last one. Let's count:\n\n- 400-409: 404\n- 410-419: 414\n- 420-429: 424\n- 430-439: 434\n- 440-449: 444\n- 450-459: 454\n- 460-469: 464\n- 470-479: 474\n- 480-488: 484\n\nSo, that's 9 occurrences in the units place for hundreds digit 4. So, in total, the units place across all three-digit numbers would be:\n\n10 (hundreds=1) + 10 (hundreds=2) + 10 (hundreds=3) + 9 (hundreds=4) = 39 occurrences.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought each hundred contributes 10, but for hundreds=4, it's 9. So, total is 39.\n\nSo, putting it all together for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 40\n- Units place: 39\n\nTotal 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 168\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place for three-digit numbers, from 400-488, how many 4's are there? Each page from 400-488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place for three-digit numbers:\n\n- For hundreds=1: 140-149: 10 4's\n- hundreds=2: 240-249: 10\n- hundreds=3: 340-349: 10\n- hundreds=4: 440-449: 10\nTotal: 40.\n\nIn the units place:\n\n- hundreds=1: 104,114,...,194: 10\n- hundreds=2: 204,214,...,294: 10\n- hundreds=3: 304,314,...,394: 10\n- hundreds=4: 404,414,...,484: 9 (as above)\nTotal: 39.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 in three-digit numbers.\n\nAdding single and two-digit:\n\n1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n\nOkay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit: Page 8. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: From 10-99.\n\nTens place: The 8 appears in the tens digit for 80-89, which is 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: The 8 appears once in each ten, like 18,28,...,98. There are 9 sets of ten (10-19, ..., 90-99), so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nNow, three-digit numbers: From 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the hundreds digit is 8, but since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can't be 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens digit across all three-digit numbers.\n\n- For hundreds=1 (100-199): The tens digit 8 appears in 180-189. That's 10 occurrences.\n- For hundreds=2 (200-299): 280-289: 10\n- For hundreds=3 (300-399): 380-389: 10\n- For hundreds=4 (400-488): The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is the tens digit 8, but the units digit goes from 0-8. So, how many pages have 8 in the tens place? From 480-488, that's 9 pages (480-488 inclusive). So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nUnits place: Now, how many times does 8 appear in the units digit across all three-digit numbers.\n\n- For hundreds=1 (100-199): The units digit 8 appears in 108,118,...,198. That's 10 occurrences.\n- For hundreds=2 (200-299): 208,218,...,298: 10\n- For hundreds=3 (300-399): 308,318,...,398: 10\n- For hundreds=4 (400-488): The units digit 8 appears in 408,418,...,488. Let's see: from 400-488, how many times does the units digit 8 appear? Each ten has one such number, except perhaps the last one. Let's count:\n\n- 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 occurrences because 488 is included, but after 488, we stop. So, from 400-488, the units digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total in the units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nAdding up the 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\nTens place: 39\n\nUnits place: 39\n\nTotal: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nWait, but let me check again. For the units place in hundreds=4, we have 408,418,...,488. How many is that? Let's list them:\n\n408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. So, yes, 9.\n\nSo, units place: 10 (hundreds=1) +10 (hundreds=2)+10 (hundreds=3)+9 (hundreds=4)=39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: 39 (tens) +39 (units) =78.\n\nAdding single-digit and two-digit:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:78\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nSo, total 4's:188\n\nTotal 8's:98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit: tens=10, units=9 \u2192 total 19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds:89\n\n- Tens:40\n\n- Units:39\n\nTotal three-digit 4's:89+40+39=168\n\nTotal 4's:1+19+168=188\n\n8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit: tens=10, units=9 \u2192 total 19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Tens:39\n\n- Units:39\n\nTotal three-digit 8's:39+39=78\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9), the digit 4 appears exactly once, which is on page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence. \n\nNext, for two-digit page numbers (10-99), I need to consider both the tens place and the units place. Let's start with the tens place. The tens digit cycles from 1 to 9, and for each ten, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in the range 40-49. That's 10 occurrences (40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49). But wait, page 44 has two 4's, so I think I need to make sure I'm counting each digit separately. So, in the tens place, it's 10 times, and in the units place, the digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers, like 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 times, but wait, 44 has a 4 in the units place as well, so that's 10 times in total for the units place? Wait, no, because from 10-99, the units digit cycles 9 times for each ten. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. For two-digit numbers, the number of 4's in the tens place is 10 (40-49). For the units place, it's 9 times, because for each ten (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the units digit is 4 once. So from 10-99, that's 9 times. But wait, 44 is in both, so it's counted twice. So total 4's in two-digit numbers would be 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19? Wait, but 44 is included in both, so actually, it's 10 in tens, and 9 in units, making 19, but 44 is counted twice, so total 19. Hmm, maybe that's correct. So, 19 4's in two-digit numbers.\n\nWait, let me check. From 10-99, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (40-49). The units digit 4 occurs once in each ten, so from 10-19:14, 20-29:24, 30-39:34, 40-49:44, 50-59:54, 60-69:64, 70-79:74, 80-89:84, 90-99:94. That's 9 times in the units place. So total 10 + 9 = 19. So, 19 4's in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Let's break this down into hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since we're going up to 488, the hundreds digit 4 only goes up to 488, not 499. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 page numbers. So, that's 89 4's.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9, and for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times. But since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let me consider each hundred separately.\n\nFor hundreds 100-199: The tens digit cycles from 0-9, and for each, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? It's 10 times for each hundred. So, in 100-199, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (140-149). Similarly, in 200-299, it's another 10 times (240-249), and in 300-399, another 10 times (340-349). Now, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 times. But wait, 488 is less than 499, so does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's another 10 times. So, total in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 times.\n\nWait, but in 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can go up to 8, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, 10 times. So, total 40 4's in the tens place for three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. Similarly, for each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9, so for each hundred, the digit 4 appears once in each ten, so 10 times per hundred. Let's check each hundred:\n\n100-199: Units digit 4 appears in 104,114,124,134,144,154,164,174,184,194. That's 10 times.\n\n200-299: Similarly, 204,214,...,294. 10 times.\n\n300-399: 304,314,...,394. 10 times.\n\n400-488: Now, units digit 4 appears in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Wait, how many is that? Let's see, from 400 to 488, the units digit 4 occurs when the number ends with 4. So, starting at 404, then 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times because 484 is within 488, but 494 would be beyond 488, so we stop at 484. So, 9 times.\n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 404,414,...,484. Let me count: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers. So, 9 times in the units place for 400-488.\n\nSo, total units place 4's in three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, but I thought each hundred would have 10, but 400-488 only has 9. So, total 39.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: hundreds place 89 + tens place 40 + units place 39 = 89+40=129+39=168\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, in three-digit numbers, the hundreds, tens, and units are separate. So, the total 4's in three-digit numbers would be the sum of hundreds, tens, and units. So, hundreds:89, tens:40, units:39. So, 89+40=129, plus 39 is 168. So, total 4's in three-digit numbers:168.\n\nAdding single and two-digit:1 +19=20. So, total 4's:20 +168=188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the three-digit numbers. Let me go through each part again.\n\nHundreds place in three-digit numbers (100-488):\n\n- 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's here.\n- 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's.\n- 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's.\n- 400-488: hundreds digit is 4. The number of pages here is 488 - 400 +1 =89 pages. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-199: tens digit 4 occurs in 140-149, which is 10 times.\n- 200-299: tens digit 4 occurs in 240-249, 10 times.\n- 300-399: tens digit 4 occurs in 340-349, 10 times.\n- 400-488: tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times because 449 is less than 488. So, 10 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's:10+10+10+10=40.\n\nUnits place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-199: units digit 4 occurs in 104,114,...,194. That's 10 times.\n- 200-299: same, 10 times.\n- 300-399: same, 10 times.\n- 400-488: units digit 4 occurs in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 times because 494 would be beyond 488.\n\nSo, units place 4's:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers:89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units)=168.\n\nAdding single and two-digit:1 +19=20. So total 4's:20+168=188.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9): the digit 8 appears once, on page 8.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers (10-99):\n\nTens place: the digit 8 appears in 80-89, which is 10 times.\n\nUnits place: in each ten (10-19,20-29,...,90-99), the units digit 8 appears once. So, from 10-99, that's 9 times (18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98). But wait, 88 has two 8's, so in the units place, it's 9 times, but 88 is included in both tens and units.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19.\n\nThree-digit page numbers (100-488):\n\nHundreds place: the hundreds digit is 1,2,3, or 4. So, the digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place here.\n\nTens place: in each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89. Let's check each hundred:\n\n- 100-199: tens digit 8 in 180-189, which is 10 times.\n- 200-299: 280-289, 10 times.\n- 300-399: 380-389, 10 times.\n- 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nUnits place in three-digit numbers:\n\nIn each hundred, the units digit 8 appears once per ten. So:\n\n- 100-199: 108,118,...,198. That's 10 times.\n- 200-299: 208,218,...,298. 10 times.\n- 300-399: 308,318,...,398. 10 times.\n- 400-488: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 times, since 488 is included, but 498 would be beyond 488.\n\nSo, units place 8's:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place 39 + units place 39=78.\n\nAdding single and two-digit:1 (single) +19 (two-digit)=20. So, total 8's:20+78=98.\n\nWait, so total 4's are 188 and total 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, for three-digit numbers, in the hundreds place, 4's:89, correct.\n\nTens place:10+10+10+10=40, correct.\n\nUnits place:10+10+10+9=39, correct.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168. Plus single and two-digit:1+19=20. Total 4's:188.\n\nFor 8's: single-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:39 (tens) +39 (units)=78. So, total 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place for three-digit numbers for 4's. Let me check again.\n\nIn 400-488, units digit 4 appears at 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 times, right? Because 404 is the first, then every 10 pages until 484. So, 9 times, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place, 400-488:408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 times, correct.\n\nSo, 4's total:188, 8's total:98, difference 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in two-digit numbers for 4's. I had 10 in tens place and 9 in units place, totaling 19. Let me list them:\n\nTens place 4's:40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49. That's 10 numbers.\n\nUnits place 4's:14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, because 44 is already counted in the tens place, but in units place, it's another occurrence. So, total 10+9=19, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in two-digit numbers: tens place 8's:80-89, 10 numbers.\n\nUnits place 8's:18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, correct.\n\nSo, I think the counts are accurate. Therefore, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: 1-9. Here, the only page that has a 4 is page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence of the digit 4.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: 10-99. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. \n\nFor the tens place: The pages are 40-49. That's 10 pages, each with a 4 in the tens place. So, 10 occurrences of 4.\n\nFor the units place: The pages are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, so I need to make sure I count both digits. However, since I'm only counting the number of 4's in the units place, each of these pages contributes one 4 except for 44, which actually has a 4 in both tens and units place. But wait, no, when I'm considering the units place separately, each occurrence is just one 4 per page. So, from 10-99, the units place 4's occur once every 10 pages. So, from 10-99, that's 9 sets of 10 (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), so 9 occurrences in the units place. But wait, 40-49 have 4 in the tens place, but their units digits can also be 4, like 44. So, actually, in the units place, from 10-99, every 10 pages, there's a 4 in the units place. So, 9 times in total, but wait, 44 is in the 40-49 range, so does that affect the count? Hmm, maybe not, because I'm counting units place separately. So, 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 9 occurrences. But wait, 44 has two 4's, so does that mean I'm missing one? No, because I'm counting each digit separately. So, 44 has a 4 in the tens and a 4 in the units. So, when I count the tens place, I count the 10 pages (40-49) as 10 occurrences, and when I count the units place, I count 9 occurrences (14,24,...,94). So, in total, for two-digit numbers, the number of 4's is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nWait, but 44 is being counted twice, once in the tens and once in the units. That's correct because 44 has two 4's. So, the total number of 4's in two-digit numbers is indeed 19.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100-488. This is a bit more complex because now we have hundreds, tens, and units places. I need to count the number of 4's in each place.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. Pages 100-199: the hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's here. Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, no 4's. Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, no 4's. Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4. So, from 400-488, how many pages are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, each of these 89 pages has a 4 in the hundreds place. That's 89 occurrences of 4.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in 100-199, the tens digit is 0-9 for each set of 10 pages. Similarly for 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all these.\n\nFirst, for 100-199: The tens digit is 4 in the range 140-149. That's 10 pages, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. So, 10 occurrences.\n\nSimilarly, for 200-299: The tens digit is 4 in 240-249. Another 10 occurrences.\n\nFor 300-399: The tens digit is 4 in 340-349. Another 10 occurrences.\n\nFor 400-488: The tens digit is 4 in 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 pages. So, 10 occurrences.\n\nSo, in the tens place across all three-digit numbers, the number of 4's is 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 occurrences.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers: Similarly, for each hundred, the units digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 pages. So, in each hundred, the units digit is 4 once every 10 pages. Let's calculate this for each hundred.\n\nFor 100-199: The units digit is 4 in 104,114,124,134,144,154,164,174,184,194. That's 10 occurrences.\n\nFor 200-299: Similarly, 204,214,...,294. Another 10 occurrences.\n\nFor 300-399: 304,314,...,394. Another 10 occurrences.\n\nFor 400-488: The units digit is 4 in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488. So, let's count: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 occurrences because 484 is the last one before 488. Wait, but 400-488 includes 488 pages, so from 400 to 488, how many times does the units digit 4 occur? Let's see: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 times because 404 is the first, and each subsequent 44 is 10 pages apart. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 pages, so how many complete sets of 10 are there? 89 / 10 = 8.9, so 8 complete sets, but actually, we can think of it as from 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 pages. So, in 89 pages, how many times does the units digit 4 occur? It occurs once every 10 pages, so 8 times (since 89 = 8*10 +9), but actually, it's 9 times because 404,414,...,484 is 9 numbers. Wait, 404 is the first, then 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. So, in 400-488, units digit 4 occurs 9 times.\n\nSo, total units digit 4's in three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 occurrences.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. For 100-199, units digit 4 occurs 10 times (104,114,...,194). Similarly for 200-299 and 300-399, each has 10. For 400-488, since it's only up to 488, the last occurrence is 484, which is the 9th occurrence. So yes, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total number of 4's in three-digit numbers is hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89+40=129+39=168.\n\nWait, but let me add that again: hundreds place is 89, tens is 40, units is 39. So, 89+40=129, plus 39 is 168. So, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 168.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 168\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 = 20, plus 168 is 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check the two-digit numbers. Earlier, I thought two-digit numbers had 19 4's, but let me recount.\n\nIn two-digit numbers (10-99):\n\n- Tens place: 40-49, which is 10 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the tens place. So, 10.\n\n- Units place: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 44 has two 4's, so does that mean I'm missing one? No, because I'm counting each occurrence separately. So, 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. So that's correct.\n\nSo, 19 in two-digit, 1 in single-digit, 168 in three-digit, totaling 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with single-digit: 8 is page 8. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: 10-99.\n\nTens place: 80-89, which is 10 pages, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the units place. However, 88 has two 8's, so when counting units place, it's still 9 occurrences because each page contributes one 8 in the units place. So, 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 occurrences in two-digit numbers.\n\nThree-digit numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, no 8's.\n\n200-299: hundreds digit is 2, no 8's.\n\n300-399: hundreds digit is 3, no 8's.\n\n400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so no 8's in hundreds place.\n\nSo, hundreds place contributes 0.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, the tens digit is 8 in the range x80-x89, where x is the hundred. So, in 100-199: 180-189, which is 10 pages. Similarly, 200-299: 280-289, 10 pages. 300-399: 380-389, 10 pages. 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, 8 occurs in 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 10 +10 +10 +9=39 occurrences.\n\nWait, no, let me clarify. For each hundred, the tens digit 8 occurs in 10 pages, except for the last hundred, which is 400-488. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place 8's: 10 (100-199) +10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+9 (400-488)=39.\n\nUnits place: For each hundred, the units digit 8 occurs once every 10 pages. So, in 100-199: 108,118,...,198. That's 10 occurrences.\n\nSimilarly, 200-299: 208,218,...,298. 10 occurrences.\n\n300-399: 308,318,...,398. 10 occurrences.\n\n400-488: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 occurrences because 408 is the first, and each subsequent 8 is 10 pages apart. 408,418,...,488. Let's count: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total units place 8's: 10 +10 +10 +9=39.\n\nTherefore, total number of 8's in three-digit numbers is tens place (39) + units place (39) = 78.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Tens place in three-digit numbers: 39, units place: 39, so total 78.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:78\n\nTotal 8's:1+19=20+78=98.\n\nSo, total 4's:188\n\nTotal 8's:98\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the three-digit numbers for 8's. Let me recount the units place in three-digit numbers for 8's.\n\nIn 100-199, units digit 8 occurs in 108,118,...,198. That's 10 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, 200-299:10, 300-399:10.\n\nIn 400-488, units digit 8 occurs in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included. So, 10+10+10+9=39. So, units place:39.\n\nSimilarly, tens place:39.\n\nSo, 39+39=78. So, three-digit 8's:78.\n\nTwo-digit 8's:19.\n\nSingle-digit:1.\n\nTotal 8's:1+19=20+78=98.\n\n4's:188.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a large difference. Let me check if I counted correctly.\n\nWait, in three-digit numbers, for 4's, I had 89 in hundreds place, 40 in tens, and 39 in units, totaling 168. Then, single-digit and two-digit gave me 1+19=20, so total 188.\n\nFor 8's, in three-digit numbers, I had 39 in tens and 39 in units, totaling 78. Plus single-digit and two-digit:1+19=20, total 98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a better way to count? Maybe using a formula or a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider each digit place separately across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\n- For 4's: In each set of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. From 1-488, there are 48 full sets of 10 (1-480) plus 8 more numbers (481-488). So, 48*1=48, plus check if 484 is within 481-488. Yes, 484 is included, so that's one more. So, total 48+1=49 occurrences in units place.\n\nWait, but earlier I counted 19 in two-digit and 39 in three-digit, which totals 58. Hmm, discrepancy here. So, perhaps my earlier method was wrong.\n\nWait, no, because in single-digit numbers, 4 is in the units place once (page 4). Then, in two-digit numbers, units place 4's: 14,24,...,94, which is 9 occurrences. In three-digit numbers, units place 4's: 104,114,...,194 (10), 204,...,294 (10), 304,...,394 (10), and 404,...,484 (9). So, 1 (single) +9 (two-digit) +39 (three-digit) =50. Wait, but according to the other method, it's 49. Hmm, conflict.\n\nWait, let's clarify. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-480, there are 48 sets of 10, so 48 times. Then, from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, 484 is included, so that's one more. So, total 48+1=49.\n\nBut according to the other method, single-digit:1, two-digit:9, three-digit:39. 1+9=10, plus 39=49. So, that's consistent. So, units place 4's:49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place:\n\nFrom 1-488, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. From 1-480, 48 sets, so 48 times. From 481-488, 488 is included, so one more. So, 48+1=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 19 in two-digit and 39 in three-digit, which is 1+19+39=59. Hmm, conflict again.\n\nWait, no, let's see. Single-digit:1 (page 8). Two-digit:18,28,...,98. That's 9 occurrences. Three-digit:108,118,...,198 (10), 208,...,298 (10), 308,...,398 (10), 408,...,488 (9). So, 10+10+10+9=39. So, total 8's in units place:1 (single) +9 (two-digit) +39 (three-digit)=49.\n\nSo, both 4's and 8's have 49 occurrences in the units place. That makes sense because in the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears equally often, except possibly the last partial set. So, 49 each.\n\nNow, let's look at the tens place.\n\nFor 4's in tens place:\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). From 1-488, how many hundreds have a tens digit of 4?\n\n- 40-49:10\n- 140-149:10\n- 240-249:10\n- 340-349:10\n- 440-449:10\n- But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10.\n\nSo, total 5 sets of 10, so 50 occurrences.\n\nWait, but earlier I had in two-digit numbers:10, and in three-digit numbers:40. So, total 50. So, that's consistent.\n\nFor 8's in tens place:\n\nSimilarly, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nFrom 1-488:\n\n- 80-89:10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 (since 488 is the end)\n\nSo, total 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nSo, 4's in tens place:50, 8's in tens place:49.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nFor 4's in hundreds place:\n\nOnly pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. That's 89 pages, so 89 occurrences.\n\nFor 8's in hundreds place:\n\nNone, since the book only goes up to 488, and 800-899 would be beyond. So, 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so that's consistent with my earlier calculation. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let me consider the units place. For every set of ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once in the units place every ten numbers. \n\nBut wait, I should also consider the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of ten numbers, like 40-49, where each number has a 4 in the tens place. That's ten 4's in a row. Similarly, for the digit 8, it appears in 80-89, giving ten 8's. \n\nNow, for the hundreds place, since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the highest hundreds digit is 4. \n\nWait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for 400-488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is zero. \n\nLet me try to structure this systematically. \n\nI think the best approach is to break down the counting into units, tens, and hundreds places separately for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. Units place:\n   - For every 10 numbers, there's one 4 in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4. That's 48 fours.\n   - But wait, from 1 to 488, the last group is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the 48th group is 481-490, but we only have up to 488. However, since we're counting the units digit, even in the incomplete group, the digit 4 in the units place occurs once (at 484). So, actually, it's 48 complete groups (each contributing one 4) plus one more 4 in the units place at 484, making it 49 fours from the units place.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Each group of 10 numbers contributes exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 4. Then, from 481 to 488, that's 8 more numbers, and within these, the units digit 4 occurs once at 484. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place:\n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place.\n   - Let me count how many such blocks there are. Starting from 40-49 (that's the first block), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks in total.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding them all up for the digit 4:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that addition: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Yes.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. Units place:\n   - Similar to the 4's, every group of 10 numbers contributes one 8 in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10? 48 groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights.\n   - Now, from 481 to 488, the units digit 8 occurs at 488. So, that's one more 8 in the units place.\n   - So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place:\n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.\n   - Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-489 is only up to 488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 eights in the tens place for that block.\n   - Let me count the blocks:\n     - 80-89: 10 eights\n     - 180-189: 10 eights\n     - 280-289: 10 eights\n     - 380-389: 10 eights\n     - 480-488: 9 eights (since 488 is the last page)\n   - So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n   - The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the highest page is 488, so the hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3, and 4. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up for the digit 8:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that addition: 49 + 49 is 98. Yes.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 188\nTotal 8's: 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me go through the calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the 4's:\n\n- Units place: From 1 to 488, how many 4's in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit 4 occurs at 484. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these 5 blocks has 10 numbers, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That's correct.\n\nNow, for the 8's:\n\n- Units place: Similarly, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit 8 occurs at 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: The blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so 9 eights in the tens place. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all the blocks correctly. For the 4's in the tens place, I had five blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the tens place, I had four full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40, and the last partial block 480-488 contributing 9 eights. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: For the units and tens places, each digit from 0-9 appears equally often, except perhaps in the last partial group. But since we're dealing with 488, which is less than 500, I think my calculations hold.\n\nWait, another thought: When counting the hundreds place for 4's, I considered 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, that's correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's, since the hundreds digit never reaches 8, that's zero.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct, and the difference is indeed 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in the units place. For every group of ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many such groups are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of ten and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, in each of these 48 groups, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once more (484). So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, let's count the number of 4's in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then each hundred has another set. From 1-99, it's 40-49 (10 numbers). Then 100-199: 140-149 (10). 200-299: 240-249 (10). 300-399: 340-349 (10). 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, right? So that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each, so 5 x 10 = 50 times. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total 4's in the hundreds place are 89.\n\nAdding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. Starting with the units place again. Similar to the 4's, in each group of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, 48 times 1 = 48, plus in the last 8 numbers, the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once more (488). So, total 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's count each range:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, that's 4 ranges with 10 each and one range with 9. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** In each group of ten (e.g., 1-10, 11-20), 4 appears once. There are 48 complete groups (488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8) plus 8 extra numbers (481-488), giving 48 + 1 = 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n  \nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 4 full ranges \u00d7 10 + 9 (480-488) = 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: from 1 to 9. The only single-digit number that has a 4 is 4 itself. So, that's 1 occurrence of the digit 4.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers: from 10 to 99. Here, the digits can be in the tens place or the units place. I'll need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place.\n\nFor the tens place: The numbers from 40 to 49 all have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4.\n\nFor the units place: The numbers where the units digit is 4 are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Let me count these: starting from 14, then adding 10 each time until 94. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences of 4 in the units place.\n\nWait, but 44 has two 4's, so does that mean I counted both the tens and units place correctly? Yes, because in the tens place, 44 was counted as part of the 40-49 range, and in the units place, it's counted as the 4 in the units digit. So, 44 contributes two 4's, which is correct. So, for two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because now we have hundreds, tens, and units places to consider. I'll need to count the number of 4's in each place separately.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're counting 4's, we'll only consider when the hundreds digit is 4. So, pages from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences of 4.\n\nNext, the tens place: We need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens digit across all three-digit numbers. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. For each hundreds digit, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, for each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit is 4 once every 100 numbers. \n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- For 100-199: The tens digit is 4 in 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n- For 200-299: Similarly, 240-249, another 10 occurrences.\n- For 300-399: 340-349, another 10 occurrences.\n- For 400-488: Here, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers as well. However, I need to check if 488 is included, but since we're only considering up to 488, 440-449 is entirely within the range. So, that's another 10 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit being 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 occurrences. So, total for the tens place across all three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is only up to 488, but the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is within 400-488, so that's correct.\n\nNow, the units place: We need to count how many times 4 appears in the units digit across all three-digit numbers. Again, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, and the tens digit can be 0-9. For each hundreds group, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundreds group, the digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n\nLet's calculate:\n\n- For 100-199: The units digit is 4 in 104, 114, 124, 134, 144, 154, 164, 174, 184, 194. That's 10 occurrences.\n- For 200-299: Similarly, 204, 214, ..., 294. Another 10.\n- For 300-399: 304, 314, ..., 394. Another 10.\n- For 400-488: Now, here, the units digit cycles from 0-9 for each tens digit, but the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? From 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens digit. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last), the units digit 4 appears once. So, that's 9 tens digits (0-8), each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 9 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digit goes up to 8 in the last group. So, for 400-488, the units digit 4 appears in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so 484 is the last one with units digit 4 before 488. So, yes, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total units digit 4's in three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 occurrences.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. For 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. So, yes, 39 total.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89 + 40 = 129, 129 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, but let me add that again: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) = 129, plus 39 (units) = 168. So, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 168.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal 4's = 1 + 19 = 20, 20 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, single-digit: 1 (only page 4)\nTwo-digit: tens place 10 (40-49), units place 9 (14,24,...,94) = 19\nThree-digit: hundreds place 89 (400-488), tens place 40 (100-399 and 400-488), units place 39 (100-399 and 400-488)\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nHmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: from 1 to 9. The only single-digit number with an 8 is 8 itself. So, that's 1 occurrence.\n\nNext, two-digit numbers: from 10 to 99.\n\nTens place: The numbers from 80 to 89 have 8 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: The numbers where the units digit is 8 are 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nBut wait, 88 has both tens and units digit as 8, so we've counted both. So, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nNow, three-digit numbers: from 100 to 488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no three-digit numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: We need to count how many times 8 appears in the tens digit across all three-digit numbers (100-488). Let's break it down by hundreds groups.\n\n- For 100-199: The tens digit is 8 in 180-189. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n- For 200-299: Similarly, 280-289, another 10.\n- For 300-399: 380-389, another 10.\n- For 400-488: The tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nUnits place: Now, how many times does 8 appear in the units digit across all three-digit numbers (100-488).\n\nAgain, breaking it down by hundreds groups:\n\n- For 100-199: The units digit is 8 in 108, 118, 128, 138, 148, 158, 168, 178, 188, 198. That's 10 occurrences.\n- For 200-299: Similarly, 208, 218, ..., 298. Another 10.\n- For 300-399: 308, 318, ..., 398. Another 10.\n- For 400-488: The units digit is 8 in 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 occurrences because the last number is 488, so up to 488, which is included. So, 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total units place 8's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place 39 + units place 39 = 78.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal 8's = 1 + 19 = 20, 20 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188\nTotal 8's: 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (correct)\nTwo-digit: tens 10, units 9 \u2192 19 (correct)\nThree-digit:\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n- Tens: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488: each contributes 10,10,10,10 \u2192 40 (correct)\n- Units: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399 each contribute 10, and 400-488 contributes 9 \u2192 39 (correct)\nTotal 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 in three-digit, plus 19 in two-digit, plus 1 \u2192 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (correct)\nTwo-digit: tens 10, units 9 \u2192 19 (correct)\nThree-digit:\n- Tens: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399 each contribute 10, and 400-488 contributes 9 \u2192 39 (correct)\n- Units: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399 each contribute 10, and 400-488 contributes 9 \u2192 39 (correct)\nTotal 8's: 39 + 39 = 78 in three-digit, plus 19 in two-digit, plus 1 \u2192 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the three-digit units place for 4's. Let me check that again.\n\nFor three-digit numbers, units place 4's:\n\n- 100-199: 104,114,...,194 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 200-299: 204,...,294 \u2192 10\n- 300-399: 304,...,394 \u2192 10\n- 400-488: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484 \u2192 9 numbers\n\nSo, 10+10+10+9=39. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place:\n\n- 100-199: 108,...,198 \u219210\n- 200-299: 208,...,298 \u219210\n- 300-399: 308,...,398 \u219210\n- 400-488: 408,...,488 \u21929\n\nSo, 10+10+10+9=39. Correct.\n\nWait, but in the three-digit tens place for 8's, 400-488: the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences. So, 10+10+10+9=39 for tens place.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188\nTotal 8's: 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 4. \u2192 1 occurrence.\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: Pages 40-49 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: Pages 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total two-digit: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: Pages 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n     - Tens place: Each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributes 10 each, and 400-488 contributes 10 \u2192 40.\n     - Units place: Each hundreds group contributes 10, and 400-488 contributes 9 \u2192 39.\n     - Total three-digit: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n   - **Total '4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 8. \u2192 1 occurrence.\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: Pages 80-89 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: Pages 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total two-digit: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: None, as the book ends at 488. \u2192 0.\n     - Tens place: Each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributes 10 each, and 400-488 contributes 9 \u2192 39.\n     - Units place: Each hundreds group contributes 10 each, and 400-488 contributes 9 \u2192 39.\n     - Total three-digit: 39 + 39 = 78.\n   - **Total '8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: from 1 to 9. The only single-digit page number with a 4 is page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence of the digit 4.\n\nNext, for two-digit page numbers: from 10 to 99. Here, the digit 4 can appear in the tens place or the units place. Let me think about how many times it appears in each place.\n\nIn the tens place: The numbers are 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place.\n\nIn the units place: For each ten, like 10-19, 20-29, etc., the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 sets of ten (10-19 up to 90-99), so 9 occurrences. Wait, but actually, from 10-99, there are 9 decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's in two-digit numbers is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: from 100 to 488. Here, the digit 4 can appear in the hundreds place, tens place, or units place. Let me handle each place separately.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, for numbers 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place: For three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 4 in various ranges. Let's break it down by hundreds.\n\nFrom 100-199: The tens digit is 4 in the range 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 200-299: Similarly, the tens digit is 4 in 240-249, another 10 numbers.\n\nFrom 300-399: The tens digit is 4 in 340-349, 10 numbers.\n\nFrom 400-488: The tens digit is 4 in 440-449. Wait, but 488 is the upper limit, so 440-449 is within 400-488. That's 10 numbers as well.\n\nSo, total in the tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 occurrences.\n\nNow, the units place: The units digit is 4 in every set of ten numbers. Let's see how many sets there are in the three-digit numbers.\n\nFrom 100-199: In each ten, like 100-109, 110-119, etc., the units digit is 4 once per ten. There are 10 tens (100-109 up to 190-199), so 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 200-299: Similarly, 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 300-399: 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 400-488: Now, this is a bit tricky because 400-488 isn't a full hundred. Let me see how many tens are there here. From 400-488, the units digit is 4 in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488, so we stop at 484. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place from 400-488? Let's count: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but let me check if 484 is within 488. Yes, 484 is less than 488, so it's included. So, 9 occurrences in 400-488.\n\nSo, total units place for three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 occurrences.\n\nWait, but wait a second. From 400-488, when considering units digit 4, it's every 10 numbers. So, starting at 404, then 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because the next one would be 494, which is beyond 488. So, yes, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total number of 4's in three-digit numbers is hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. So, total 4's are 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 1 + 19 = 20, plus 168 is 188. So, 188 occurrences of the digit 4.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: from 1 to 9. The only single-digit page number with an 8 is page 8. So, that's 1 occurrence.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: from 10 to 99. The digit 8 can appear in the tens place or the units place.\n\nIn the tens place: The numbers are 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences in the tens place.\n\nIn the units place: For each ten, like 10-19, 20-29, etc., the units digit is 8 once per ten. There are 9 decades (10-19 up to 90-99), so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total number of 8's in two-digit numbers is 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: from 100 to 488. The digit 8 can appear in the hundreds place, tens place, or units place.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place in any three-digit page number here because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is never 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place: For three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 8 in various ranges.\n\nFrom 100-199: The tens digit is 8 in 180-189. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 200-299: Similarly, the tens digit is 8 in 280-289, another 10 numbers.\n\nFrom 300-399: The tens digit is 8 in 380-389, 10 numbers.\n\nFrom 400-488: The tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Wait, but 488 is the upper limit, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 occurrences here.\n\nSo, total in the tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 occurrences.\n\nNow, the units place: The units digit is 8 in every set of ten numbers. Let's see how many sets there are in the three-digit numbers.\n\nFrom 100-199: In each ten, like 100-109, 110-119, etc., the units digit is 8 once per ten. There are 10 tens (100-109 up to 190-199), so 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 200-299: Similarly, 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 300-399: 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 400-488: The units digit is 8 in 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. Let's count: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total units place for three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 occurrences.\n\nWait, but let me check if 488 is included. Yes, 488 is the last page, so it's included. So, 9 occurrences in the units place for 400-488.\n\nSo, total number of 8's in three-digit numbers is tens place (39) + units place (39) = 78.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) = 1 + 19 = 20, plus 78 is 98.\n\nWait, no, 1 + 19 is 20, plus 78 is 98. So, total 8's are 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the three-digit counts. For the tens place, I had 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. For the units place, same thing: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. So, 39 + 39 = 78. Then, adding the two-digit 19 and single-digit 1, that's 78 + 19 = 97, plus 1 is 98. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought from 400-488, the units digit 8 occurs 9 times, which is correct because 408, 418, ..., 488 is 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences in units place for 400-488.\n\nSo, total 8's: 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Single-digit: 1. Two-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. Three-digit: tens place 39, units place 39, so 78. So, 1 + 19 + 78 = 98. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's. Single-digit: 1. Two-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. Three-digit: hundreds place 89, tens place 40, units place 39. So, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. Then, 1 + 19 + 168 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's: single-digit 1, two-digit 19, three-digit 78. 1 + 19 + 78 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a big difference. Let me check if I counted correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the three-digit numbers for 4's. Let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, correct? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place: For three-digit numbers, 100-199: 140-149 is 10 numbers. 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers because 440 to 449 is 10 numbers. So, 10 each, so 40 total. That seems right.\n\nUnits place: 100-199: 104, 114, ..., 194. That's 10 numbers. Similarly, 200-299: 10, 200-299 has 204, 214, ..., 294, which is 10. 300-399: 304, 314, ..., 394, 10. 400-488: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 494 would be beyond 488. So, 9. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. So, 39 in units place.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. Then, 1 + 19 + 168 = 188. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's, let's check again. Single-digit: 1. Two-digit: tens place 10, units place 9, total 19. Three-digit: tens place 39, units place 39, total 78. So, 1 + 19 + 78 = 98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the units place correctly for 4's in three-digit numbers. From 100-199: 104, 114, 124, ..., 194. That's 10 numbers. Similarly, 200-299: 10, 300-399: 10. 400-488: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: 100-199: 108, 118, ..., 198: 10 numbers. 200-299: 10. 300-399: 10. 400-488: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488: 9 numbers. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. Correct.\n\nI think my counts are accurate. So, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: from 1 to 9. The digit 4 appears once, which is on page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence.\n\nNext, for two-digit numbers, from 10 to 99. Here, the digit 4 can appear in the tens place or the units place. Let's calculate each separately.\n\nIn the tens place: The numbers are 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nIn the units place: For each ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. Since there are 9 tens (10-90), each contributing one 4, that's 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers, from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because there are three places to consider: hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's see:\n\n- For hundreds digit 1: The numbers are 100 to 199. In this range, the digit 4 can appear in the tens or units place. So, how many 4's in the tens place? It's from 140 to 149, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. Similarly, in the units place, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears once every ten numbers. So, from 104, 114, 124, ..., 194. That's 10 occurrences. So, total for hundreds digit 1: 10 (tens) + 10 (units) = 20.\n\n- For hundreds digit 2: Similarly, the numbers are 200 to 299. The same logic applies. 240-249 gives 10 in the tens place, and 204, 214, ..., 294 gives 10 in the units place. So, another 20.\n\n- For hundreds digit 3: Numbers 300 to 399. Again, 340-349 is 10, and 304, 314, ..., 394 is 10. So, another 20.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4: Now, this is where it gets a bit tricky because the book ends at 488, not 499. So, the hundreds digit is 4, but we have to be careful with the tens and units places.\n\nIn the tens place: The numbers would be 440 to 449. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within range. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nIn the units place: The numbers would be 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, but the book stops at 488, so 484 is okay, but 494 would be beyond. So, from 404 to 484, stepping by 10, that's 9 numbers: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but when hundreds digit is 4, the tens and units places can only go up to 88 in the last partial hundred (400-488). So, for units place, it's 404, 414, ..., 484, which is 9 numbers as above.\n\nSo, for hundreds digit 4, the number of 4's is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nBut wait, I should also check if there's a 4 in the hundreds place when the number is exactly 400. But 400 is part of the hundreds digit 4, so 400 is included, but the hundreds digit is 4, so that's one occurrence. Wait, but in the hundreds place, for hundreds digit 4, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, right? So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89), so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these 89 numbers. So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. When I was considering hundreds digits, I was only counting the 4's in the tens and units places, but I forgot that the hundreds digit itself is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 times. So, I need to add that to the total.\n\nSo, let me correct that. For three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 20 (as before)\n- Hundreds digit 2: 20\n- Hundreds digit 3: 20\n- Hundreds digit 4: Now, hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers (400-488). So, that's 89 occurrences. Plus, as before, in the tens place, 440-449 is 10, and in the units place, 404, 414, ..., 484 is 9. So, total for hundreds digit 4: 89 + 10 + 9 = 108.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me think again. When hundreds digit is 4, the hundreds place contributes 89 times. The tens place: 440-449 is 10, which is within 400-488, so that's 10. The units place: from 404, 414, ..., 484, which is 9 numbers (since 404 to 484 is 9 steps of 10). So, total 89 + 10 + 9 = 108.\n\nSo, total three-digit 4's: 20 (hundreds=1) + 20 (hundreds=2) + 20 (hundreds=3) + 108 (hundreds=4) = 20+20+20+108=168.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Because when hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3, the hundreds digit is not 4, so we don't count those in the hundreds place. So, for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, each contributes 20 (10 in tens, 10 in units). So, 20*3=60. Then, for hundreds digit 4, it's 89 in hundreds place, plus 10 in tens, plus 9 in units, totaling 108. So, total three-digit 4's: 60 + 108 = 168.\n\nWait, but I think I might have double-counted somewhere. Let me see. For hundreds digit 1, we count the 4's in tens and units, but not in hundreds. Similarly for 2 and 3. For 4, we count hundreds, tens, and units. So, 168 seems correct.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the three-digit count.\n\nWait, when hundreds digit is 1, the numbers are 100-199. The 4's in tens place: 140-149, which is 10. In units place: 104,114,...,194, which is 10. So, 20 total. Similarly for hundreds digits 2 and 3, each contributes 20. So, 20*3=60.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Hundreds place: 89 times. Tens place: 440-449, which is 10. Units place: 404,414,...,484. Let's count how many: starting at 404, each 10 up to 484. So, 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers. So, 9 in units place.\n\nSo, hundreds digit 4 contributes 89 (hundreds) +10 (tens) +9 (units)=108.\n\nSo, total 4's: 60 + 108=168 in three-digit. Plus single-digit 1 and two-digit 19: 168+19=187, plus 1 is 188. Hmm, okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nStarting with single-digit: page 8. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: 80-89 in the tens place, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. In the units place, for each ten (10-19,20-29,...,90-99), the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 18,28,...,98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total two-digit 8's: 10 (tens) +9 (units)=19.\n\nThree-digit numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds digit 1: 100-199. The 8's can be in tens or units.\n\nTens place: 180-189, which is 10 numbers.\n\nUnits place: 108,118,...,198. That's 10 numbers (from 108 to 198, step 10). So, 10 occurrences.\n\nSo, hundreds digit 1: 10 (tens) +10 (units)=20.\n\nSimilarly, hundreds digit 2: 200-299.\n\nTens place: 280-289, 10 numbers.\n\nUnits place: 208,218,...,298, which is 10 numbers.\n\nSo, 20.\n\nHundreds digit 3: 300-399.\n\nTens place: 380-389, 10 numbers.\n\nUnits place: 308,318,...,398, which is 10 numbers.\n\nSo, 20.\n\nHundreds digit 4: 400-488.\n\nTens place: 480-489, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Let's count: from 408, each 10 up to 488. So, 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers.\n\nAdditionally, in the hundreds place, the hundreds digit is 4, but we're only counting 8's, so the hundreds digit doesn't contribute any 8's here.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, the hundreds digit is 4, so no 8's there. So, for hundreds digit 4, the 8's are in tens and units.\n\nSo, tens place: 9 (480-488).\n\nUnits place: 9 (408,418,...,488).\n\nSo, total for hundreds digit 4: 9 +9=18.\n\nNow, adding up the three-digit 8's:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1:20\n- Hundreds digit 2:20\n- Hundreds digit 3:20\n- Hundreds digit 4:18\nTotal: 20+20+20+18=78.\n\nNow, total 8's:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit:78\nTotal:1+19=20; 20+78=98.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me check again.\n\nWait, single-digit:1 (page 8).\n\nTwo-digit: tens place 80-89 (10) and units place 18,28,...,98 (9), so 10+9=19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: tens 180-189 (10), units 108,118,...,198 (10). So, 20.\n- Hundreds digit 2: same, 20.\n- Hundreds digit 3: same, 20.\n- Hundreds digit 4: tens 480-488 (9), units 408,418,...,488 (9). So, 18.\n\nSo, three-digit 8's: 20+20+20+18=78.\n\nSo, total 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:188.\n\nTotal 8's:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier that the 4's were 188 and 8's were 98, so the difference is 90. But let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nWait, in three-digit numbers, for hundreds digit 4, I had 89 occurrences in the hundreds place, which is correct because 400-488 is 89 numbers. But when counting 8's in three-digit numbers, I had 78. Let me confirm that.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the three-digit 8's. Let me go through it again.\n\nFor three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 100-199.\n\nTens place 8's: 180-189: 10 numbers.\n\nUnits place 8's: 108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198. That's 10 numbers.\n\nSo, 10+10=20.\n\nSimilarly for hundreds digits 2 and 3: each contributes 20.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: 400-488.\n\nTens place 8's: 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488).\n\nUnits place 8's: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers.\n\nSo, 9+9=18.\n\nSo, three-digit 8's:20+20+20+18=78.\n\nSo, total 8's:1 (single-digit) +19 (two-digit) +78=98.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, total 4's:188.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a lot. Let me see if there's another way to count.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units place:\n\nTotal numbers:488.\n\nIn the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears equally often, except possibly the last digit if 488 isn't a multiple of 10.\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10:48 full groups (1-480), and then 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n\nIn each group of 10, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place.\n\nSo, for units place:\n\nNumber of 4's:48 full groups *1=48, plus in the last partial group (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so no 4. So, total 4's in units place:48.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in units place:48 full groups *1=48, plus in the last partial group, units digit 8 appears once (488). So, total 8's in units place:48+1=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 4's in units place as 48 + something? Wait, no, in my initial count, I had for three-digit numbers, 10 in units place for hundreds digits 1,2,3, and 9 for hundreds digit 4. That was 30+9=39. Plus single-digit:1, two-digit:9, so total 1+9+39=49. Wait, but according to this method, units place 4's are 48. Hmm, discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial method. Let me see.\n\nWait, using this method:\n\nUnits place:\n\nTotal 4's: floor(488/10)=48 full cycles, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus, in the last partial cycle (481-488), units digits go from 1-8, so no 4. So, total 4's in units place:48.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place:48 full cycles *1=48, plus in the last partial cycle, units digit 8 appears once (488). So, total 49.\n\nSo, according to this, units place 4's:48, 8's:49.\n\nBut in my initial count, I had 49 4's in units place. So, perhaps I overcounted.\n\nWait, let's see. In single-digit numbers, units place is the same as the number itself, so 4 appears once.\n\nIn two-digit numbers, units place 4's: from 10-99, each ten has one 4 in units place, so 9 tens (10-90), so 9.\n\nIn three-digit numbers, units place 4's: for hundreds digits 1,2,3, each contributes 10 (as in 104,114,...,194; 204,...,294; 304,...,394). So, 10*3=30. For hundreds digit 4, units place 4's:404,414,...,484. That's 9 numbers (since 404 to 484 is 9 steps of 10). So, 9.\n\nSo, total units place 4's:1 (single-digit) +9 (two-digit) +30 (three-digit, hundreds 1-3) +9 (three-digit, hundreds=4)=1+9+30+9=49.\n\nBut according to the other method, it's 48. Hmm, so which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the first method is wrong because in the last partial group, 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so no 4, but the total units digits from 1-488 is 488 numbers, which is 48 full tens and 8 extra. So, 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Plus, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), units digits 1-8, so no 4. So, total 4's in units place:48.\n\nBut according to the initial count, it's 49. So, where is the mistake?\n\nAh, I think I know. In the three-digit numbers, when hundreds digit is 4, the units place 4's go up to 484, which is 484, so that's 404,414,...,484. Let's count how many that is.\n\nFrom 404 to 484, stepping by 10: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers. So, 9.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digits 1,2,3, each contributes 10, so 3*10=30.\n\nPlus single-digit 4:1, two-digit:9.\n\nSo, 1+9+30+9=49.\n\nBut according to the other method, it's 48. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the other method is missing something. Because 488 is the last page, so when we count units digits, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in units place is indeed 49. Because 4,14,24,...,484. Let's see how many terms that is.\n\nThe sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 4 +10(n-1)=484.\n\nSo, 10(n-1)=480 => n-1=48 =>n=49.\n\nSo, there are 49 terms. So, the units place 4's are 49.\n\nSimilarly, units place 8's:8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many terms.\n\n8 +10(n-1)=488 =>10(n-1)=480 =>n-1=48 =>n=49.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so that's 49 terms. But according to the earlier count, it's 49. But in the initial count, I had 49 for 4's and 49 for 8's, but that can't be because the last partial group only adds one more 8.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.\n\nThe total number of units digits from 1 to 488 is 488 numbers.\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears floor(488/10)=48 times in each units place, except for the last partial group.\n\nFor digit 4:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in units place:48 full cycles (each contributing 1) + check if the last partial group (481-488) has a 4. The units digits in 481-488 are 1-8, so no 4. So, total 48.\n\nBut according to the term count, it's 49. So, there's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps the term count is correct because 488 includes 484 as the last 4 in units place. Let me list them:\n\n4,14,24,...,484. How many terms?\n\nFrom 4 to 484, step 10.\n\nNumber of terms: ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49.\n\nSo, 49 times. So, the correct count is 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\n8,18,28,...,488.\n\nNumber of terms: ((488 -8)/10)+1=(480/10)+1=48+1=49.\n\nSo, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but according to the other method, 4's would be 48, but the term count shows 49. So, perhaps the other method was wrong because it didn't account for the fact that 484 is included, making it 49.\n\nSo, perhaps my initial count was correct with 49 units place 4's and 49 units place 8's.\n\nBut then, in the initial count, I had total 4's as 188 and 8's as 98, but that can't be because if units place contributes 49 for both, but in the initial count, 4's had more.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to reconcile these counts.\n\nWait, let's try a different approach: count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nAs above, 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor tens place, each digit 0-9 appears equally in each ten's position.\n\nTotal numbers:488.\n\nNumber of complete groups of 100:4 full groups (1-400), and then 88 extra numbers (401-488).\n\nIn each group of 100, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 00-09, 10-19,...,90-99). But since we're dealing with page numbers starting at 1, the first group is 1-99, then 100-199, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to consider how many times each digit appears in the tens place.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nEach digit from 0-9 appears in the tens place for each hundred. For example, in 1-99, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times (but actually, 0 appears only in 1-9 as the tens digit is 0, but page numbers don't have leading zeros, so the tens digit for 1-9 is 0, but we don't count leading zeros. So, perhaps it's better to think in terms of actual page numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps a better method is:\n\nFor each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), count how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nAs above, 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach digit from 0-9 appears in the tens place for each hundred. For example, in 1-99, the tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place, except for 0, which appears 9 times (since 1-9 have no leading zero). Wait, no, in page numbers, 1-9 are single-digit, so their tens digit is 0, but we don't write leading zeros, so the tens digit for 1-9 is considered as 0. So, in 1-99, the tens digit 0 appears 9 times (for 1-9), and digits 1-9 appear 10 times each (e.g., 10-19 have tens digit 1, etc.).\n\nSimilarly, in 100-199, the tens digit cycles 0-9 for each hundred, so each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSame for 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nSo, total number of times a digit appears in the tens place:\n\nFor digit 4:\n\nIn 1-99: tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49).\n\nIn 100-199: tens digit 4 appears 10 times (140-149).\n\nSimilarly, 200-299:10 times.\n\n300-399:10 times.\n\n400-488: tens digit 4 appears for 440-449, which is 10 times, but since 400-488 includes up to 488, 440-449 is fully included, so 10 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's:10 (1-99) +10+10+10+10=50.\n\nWait, but 400-488: tens digit 4 is 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 10.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's:50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place:\n\nIn 1-99:80-89, 10 times.\n\nIn 100-199:180-189,10.\n\n200-299:280-289,10.\n\n300-399:380-389,10.\n\n400-488:480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488).\n\nSo, total tens place 8's:10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nSo, tens place:\n\n4's:50\n\n8's:49\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nEach digit from 1-4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nFor 4's in hundreds place:\n\nOnly in 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, 89 times.\n\nFor 8's in hundreds place:\n\nBut wait, the hundreds digit can only be 1,2,3,4 in this book. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n\n4's:89\n\n8's:0\n\nNow, summing up:\n\nUnits place:\n\n4's:49\n\n8's:49\n\nTens place:\n\n4's:50\n\n8's:49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's:89\n\n8's:0\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that matches my initial count.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Units Place:** From 1 to 488, each digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place. There are 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4, totaling 48. The last partial cycle (481-488) doesn't add a 4, but term counting shows 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** Each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. With 4 hundreds (1-400, 100-199, etc.), it's 10*4=40. However, detailed counting shows 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, 4 appears 89 times.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Units Place:** Similarly, 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** Each hundred has 10 occurrences except the last, which has 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 0 occurrences since 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: the only single-digit number with a 4 is page 4. So that's 1 occurrence of 4. \n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers. Here, 4 can appear in the tens place or the units place. Let's separate these. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers from 40 to 49 all have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4. \n\nFor the units place: The numbers where the units digit is 4 are 4, 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but I already counted page 4 in the single-digit numbers, so in the two-digit numbers, it's 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences of 4 in the units place. \n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, total 4's are 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers. These range from 100 to 488. Let's break this down by hundreds, tens, and units places. \n\nFirst, the hundreds place: In the hundreds place, 4 appears from page 400 to 488. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. \n\nNext, the tens place: For three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 4. This occurs in the range 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but we need to check up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-489 isn't part of our book. So, each of these ranges (140-149, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. \n\nSo, how many such ranges are there? From 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, 400-488 is the last set, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, but for the tens place, we're looking for when the tens digit is 4. So, in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488, how many times does the tens digit equal 4? \n\nIn each hundred block (like 100-199), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (140-149). So, for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each contributes 10 occurrences. But in 400-488, the tens digit can be 4 (440-449) and maybe 450-459, etc., but actually, the tens digit being 4 is only from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. However, since 488 is the last page, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. \n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit can be 0-8. So, for the tens digit being 4, it's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in total, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? \n\nFor each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), it's 10 each, so 3\u00d710=30. Plus in 400-488, it's another 10, so total 40 occurrences in the tens place. \n\nWait, but wait: 400-488 is part of the 400s, so when considering the hundreds place, we already counted 4 in the hundreds place for 400-488. Now, for the tens place, in 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, when the tens digit is 4, it's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 occurrences. So, in total, for the tens place, it's 10 (from 100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40. \n\nNow, the units place for three-digit numbers: Here, the units digit is 4. So, in each hundred block, the units digit cycles from 0-9. So, in 100-199, the numbers ending with 4 are 104,114,124,134,144,154,164,174,184,194. That's 10 numbers. Similarly, in 200-299, it's 204,214,...,294, another 10. In 300-399, same thing: 304,314,...,394, 10 numbers. Now, in 400-488, the units digit is 4 in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Wait, 484 is within 488, so that's 9 numbers because 484 is the ninth occurrence (since 404 is the first, then every 10). Wait, let me count: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the ninth, as 488 is the last page, so 494 would be beyond 488. So, in 400-488, units digit 4 occurs 9 times. \n\nSo, total units digit 4's in three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39. \n\nSo, for three-digit numbers, total 4's are hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89+40=129+39=168. \n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1+19=20+168=188. So, 188 occurrences of 4.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's. \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: the only single-digit number with an 8 is page 8. So that's 1 occurrence.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers. 8 can appear in the tens place or the units place.\n\nFor the tens place: The numbers from 80 to 89 have 8 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nFor the units place: The numbers where the units digit is 8 are 8, 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. But again, page 8 is single-digit, so in two-digit numbers, it's 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, total 8's are 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, from 100 to 488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nTens place: For three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 8. This occurs in the ranges 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. \n\nSo, in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 3\u00d710=30. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 30 + 9 = 39 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: For three-digit numbers, the units digit is 8. So, in each hundred block, the units digit cycles from 0-9. So, in 100-199, the numbers ending with 8 are 108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198. That's 10 numbers. Similarly, in 200-299, it's 208,218,...,298, another 10. In 300-399, same thing: 308,318,...,398, 10 numbers. Now, in 400-488, the units digit is 8 in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included, so 408,418,...,488, which is 9 numbers (since 408 is the first, and every 10 after that up to 488). \n\nSo, total units digit 8's in three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nWait, let me check that: 10+10+10=30, plus 9 is 39. So, units place 8's: 39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place (39) + units place (39) = 78.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) = 1+19=20+78=98.\n\nSo, total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 4).\n\nTwo-digit: tens place 40-49: 10, units place 14,24,...,94: 9, total 19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place: 400-488: 89.\n\nTens place: 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: 10 each for the first three, and 10 in 440-449, but wait, in 400-488, 440-449 is included, so that's 10, so total tens place 4's: 3\u00d710 +10=40.\n\nUnits place: 104,114,...,194:10; 204,...,294:10; 304,...,394:10; 404,...,484:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168 in three-digit. Plus single and two-digit: 1+19=20, total 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1.\n\nTwo-digit:80-89:10, units place 18,28,...,98:9, total 19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nTens place: 180-189,280-289,380-389: each 10, so 3\u00d710=30; and 480-488:9, so total 39.\n\nUnits place:108,118,...,198:10; 208,...,298:10; 308,...,398:10; 408,...,488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nTotal in three-digit:39+39=78.\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I correctly accounted for all the ranges, especially in the three-digit numbers. For example, in the tens place for 8's, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, correct. Similarly, in units place for 8's in 400-488, it's up to 488, so 408,418,...,488, which is 9 numbers. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Single-digit:** 1 occurrence (page 4).\n   - **Two-digit:** 10 in the tens place (40-49) and 9 in the units place (14, 24, ..., 94), totaling 19.\n   - **Three-digit:** \n     - Hundreds place: 89 occurrences (400-488).\n     - Tens place: 40 occurrences (140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n     - Units place: 39 occurrences (104, 114, ..., 484).\n   - **Total 4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Single-digit:** 1 occurrence (page 8).\n   - **Two-digit:** 10 in the tens place (80-89) and 9 in the units place (18, 28, ..., 98), totaling 19.\n   - **Three-digit:** \n     - Tens place: 39 occurrences (180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488).\n     - Units place: 39 occurrences (108, 118, ..., 488).\n   - **Total 8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

In two-digit numbers, the tens place and the units place can each have a 4. Let me think: from 10 to 99, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, the tens place is 4 for numbers 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So that's 10 occurrences. Then, in the units place, 4 appears once every ten numbers, like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, etc., up to 94. So that's 9 times (since 44 is already counted in the tens place, but wait, no, actually, each occurrence is counted separately. So from 10-99, how many numbers end with 4? It's 9 times because from 10-99, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers. So in two-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times.\n\nWait, but 44 has two 4's, so in the units place, we're counting each occurrence, so 44 contributes two 4's. So actually, when I count the tens place, I get 10, and the units place, I get 9, but in reality, the units place from 10-99 includes 44, which is already in the tens place. Wait, no, I think I'm overcomplicating. Each digit is counted separately. So in the tens place, 40-49 gives 10 4's in the tens digit. In the units place, for each ten, like 10-19, 20-29, etc., there's one 4 in the units place, so from 10-99, that's 9 decades (10-19 up to 90-99), each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 9 times. So total 4's in two-digit numbers are 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nWait, but 44 is counted twice here, once in the tens and once in the units. So that's correct because 44 has two 4's, so it's contributing two to the total count.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers, which are from 100 to 488. So, let's break this down by hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit 4 will only go up to 488, not 499. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place: In three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 0-9. We need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers up to 488.\n\nLet's consider each hundred separately: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nFor 100-199: The tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (e.g., 140-149). So, 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 200-299: same thing, 10 times.\n\nFor 300-399: same, 10 times.\n\nFor 400-488: Now, the tens digit can go from 0-8 because 488 is the limit. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times.\n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit can be 0-8. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nSo, total in the tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 times.\n\nNow, the units place: Similarly, in each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, the units digit 4 occurs once every 10 numbers, so 10 times per hundred.\n\nAgain, considering 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nFor 100-199: 10 times (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194).\n\nSame for 200-299: 10 times.\n\nSame for 300-399: 10 times.\n\nFor 400-488: Now, how many times does the units digit 4 occur? From 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, how many complete decades are there? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, which is 8 full decades (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488). Wait, no, 89 divided by 10 is 8 full decades (400-480) and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, in each of the 8 full decades, the units digit 4 occurs once, so 8 times. Then, in the last partial decade (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 484 is included, so that's one more occurrence. So total in 400-488: 8 + 1 = 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs at 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, total units digit 4's in three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought each hundred contributes 10, but 400-488 only contributes 9. So total is 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\n- Tens place: 40 times\n- Units place: 39 times\n\nTotal 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check the three-digit counts.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred (100-199, etc.), the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times per hundred. There are four hundreds: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is not a full hundred. So, in 400-488, does the tens digit 4 occur 10 times? Let's see: 440-449 is 10 numbers, so yes, 10 times. So, 10 per hundred, and there are four hundreds, so 4 x 10 = 40. That seems correct.\n\nIn the units place, each hundred contributes 10 times, except 400-488, which contributes 9 times. So, 3 x 10 + 9 = 39. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 in three-digit numbers. Plus 19 in two-digit and 1 in single-digit: total 188 4's.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit: The single-digit 8 is page 8, so that's 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens and units places.\n\nTens place: From 10-99, the tens digit is 8 for numbers 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times.\n\nUnits place: In each ten (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the units digit is 8 once. So, from 10-99, that's 9 decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 9 times.\n\nWait, but 88 has both tens and units digits as 8, so it's counted twice. But since we're counting each occurrence, that's correct.\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, 8's appear 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers, from 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers up to 488.\n\nAgain, considering each hundred:\n\n100-199: The tens digit is 8 in 180-189, which is 10 numbers.\n\n200-299: Similarly, 280-289, 10 numbers.\n\n300-399: 380-389, 10 numbers.\n\n400-488: The tens digit is 8 in 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total in the tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nUnits place: Now, in each hundred, the units digit 8 occurs once every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, 10 times.\n\nBut let's check each hundred:\n\n100-199: Units digit 8 occurs at 108, 118, 128, 138, 148, 158, 168, 178, 188, 198. That's 10 times.\n\n200-299: Similarly, 208, 218, ..., 298. 10 times.\n\n300-399: 308, 318, ..., 398. 10 times.\n\n400-488: Units digit 8 occurs at 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 times because 488 is included, but 488 is within 400-488, so yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, total units digit 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, the digit 8 appears:\n\n- Tens place: 39 times\n- Units place: 39 times\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nNow, summing up all the 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Single-digit: 1. Two-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. Three-digit: 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78. So total 1 + 19 + 78 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because 90 seems a bit high. Let me recount the 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 4).\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place: 10 (40-49)\n- Units place: 9 (14,24,...,94)\nTotal: 19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 (400-488)\n- Tens place: 40 (10 per hundred for 100-399, and 10 in 400-488)\n- Units place: 39 (10 per hundred for 100-399, and 9 in 400-488)\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 8).\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place: 10 (80-89)\n- Units place: 9 (18,28,...,98)\nTotal: 19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Tens place: 39 (10 in 100-199, 10 in 200-299, 10 in 300-399, 9 in 400-488)\n- Units place: 39 (10 in 100-199, 10 in 200-299, 10 in 300-399, 9 in 400-488)\nTotal: 78.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place for three-digit numbers. Let me check again.\n\nIn the units place for three-digit numbers:\n\nFor 100-199: units digit 4 occurs at 104,114,124,134,144,154,164,174,184,194: 10 times.\n\nSame for 200-299: 204,...,294: 10 times.\n\nSame for 300-399: 304,...,394: 10 times.\n\nFor 400-488: units digit 4 occurs at 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484: that's 9 times because 484 is within 400-488, and we stop at 488, so 484 is included, making it 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, units digit 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nSimilarly, for units digit 8's:\n\n100-199: 108,118,...,198: 10 times.\n\n200-299: 208,...,298: 10 times.\n\n300-399: 308,...,398: 10 times.\n\n400-488: 408,418,...,488: 9 times (since 488 is included, so 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488: 9 numbers).\n\nSo, units digit 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nSame for tens digit 8's:\n\n100-199: 180-189: 10 times.\n\n200-299: 280-289: 10 times.\n\n300-399: 380-389: 10 times.\n\n400-488: 480-488: 9 times (since 480-488 is 9 numbers).\n\nSo, tens digit 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\nAdding single-digit and two-digit 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, the counts seem correct. Therefore, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. But in 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's correct. But let me make sure I didn't double-count any digits. Each digit is counted separately, so 400-488 contributes 89 4's in the hundreds place, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens and units places, each occurrence is counted separately, so 444 would have two 4's, but they're both counted in their respective places.\n\nI think my counts are accurate. So, the difference is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding how many more 4's are printed than 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 4 has a 4. \u2192 1 occurrence.\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 40-49 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: 14, 24, ..., 94 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n     - Tens place: Each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributes 10, and 400-488 contributes 10 \u2192 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40.\n     - Units place: Each hundred contributes 10, except 400-488 which contributes 9 \u2192 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n     - Total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n   - **Total 4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 8 has an 8. \u2192 1 occurrence.\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 80-89 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: 18, 28, ..., 98 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Tens place: Each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributes 10, and 400-488 contributes 9 \u2192 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n     - Units place: Each hundred contributes 10, except 400-488 which contributes 9 \u2192 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n     - Total: 39 + 39 = 78.\n   - **Total 8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThere are \\boxed{90} more 4's printed than 8's."

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: Only page 4 has a 4. So that's 1 occurrence.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: Here, the 4 can appear in the tens place or the ones place. For the tens place, the numbers would be 40-49, which is 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. So that's 10 occurrences. For the ones place, the numbers would be 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but since we're only going up to 99, that's 9 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the ones place. But wait, 44 has two 4's, so does that count twice? Hmm, yes, because each digit is counted separately. So, for the ones place, from 14 to 94, stepping by 10, that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4, except 44 which has two. Wait, no, actually, each occurrence is counted separately, so 44 would contribute two 4's. So, in the ones place, the number of 4's is 9 (from 14,24,...,94) plus one more for the second 4 in 44? Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The ones place for two-digit numbers: The 4 can be in the ones place for each ten's group. So, for each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the ones digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each ten's group, there's exactly one 4 in the ones place. There are 9 ten's groups in two-digit numbers (10-99), so that's 9 occurrences. But wait, 44 is in the 40-49 group, which we've already counted as 10 4's in the tens place. So, in the ones place, it's 9 4's, but 44 is included in both counts. But when counting digits, each digit is counted separately, so 44 contributes two 4's: one in the tens and one in the ones. So, for two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (ones place) = 19. Wait, but 44 is included in both, so does that mean we're double-counting it? No, because each digit is counted separately. So, 44 contributes two 4's, one in the tens and one in the ones. So, the total for two-digit numbers is indeed 10 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 19 4's.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 10-99, how many 4's in the tens place? 10 (40-49). How many in the ones place? For each ten's group, one 4, so 9 (from 14,24,...,94). So yes, 10+9=19.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100-488. Here, the 4 can appear in the hundreds, tens, or ones place. Let's break it down:\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nTens place: Now, looking at the tens digit. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in the range 100-488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. For each hundreds group, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? \n\nFor hundreds groups 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: In each of these, the tens digit 4 appears in the range x40-x49, where x is the hundreds digit. Each such range has 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences per hundreds group. There are 3 hundreds groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), so 3*10=30 4's in the tens place.\n\nFor the hundreds group 400-488: The tens digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 4's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 30 + 10 = 40.\n\nWait, but wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 30 from the first three hundreds groups and 10 from 400-488, totaling 40.\n\nNow, ones place: The ones digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, in the range 100-488, how many times does 4 appear in the ones place?\n\nFor each hundreds group, the ones digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, for each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the ones digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n\nFirst, let's calculate for 100-199: There are 100 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the ones place (104,114,...,194).\n\nSimilarly, for 200-299: 10 occurrences (204,214,...,294).\n\nSame for 300-399: 10 occurrences (304,314,...,394).\n\nNow, for 400-488: How many numbers are there? 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, how many times does the ones digit 4 appear? It's every 10 numbers, so starting from 404,414,..., up to 484. Let's see: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers. Wait, because 484 is the last one before 488. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total ones place 4's in three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) +10 (200-299) +10 (300-399) +9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nWait, but let me check: 100-199: 104,114,...,194: 10 numbers. Similarly for 200-299 and 300-399. For 400-488, the ones digit 4 appears at 404,414,...,484. How many is that? From 404 to 484, stepping by 10: (484-404)/10 +1 = (80)/10 +1=8+1=9. So yes, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total ones place 4's: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (ones) = 168\n\nTotal 4's:1+19+168=188.\n\nWait, let me check that addition again. 1 (single) +19 (two-digit) =20. 20 +168=188. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit: Only page 8, so 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers: 8 can appear in the tens place or the ones place.\n\nTens place: 80-89, which is 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, 10 occurrences.\n\nOnes place: For each ten's group (10-19,20-29,...,90-99), the ones digit 8 appears once per group. There are 9 ten's groups (10-99), so 9 occurrences. But wait, in the 80-89 group, the ones digit 8 appears in 88, which we've already counted in the tens place. But when counting digits, each occurrence is counted separately. So, in the ones place, from 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the ones place. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers:10 (tens) +9 (ones) =19.\n\nNow, three-digit page numbers:100-488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8? Wait, no, because the book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place in three-digit numbers here.\n\nTens place: The tens digit can be 8 in the ranges x80-x89, where x is the hundreds digit.\n\nSo, for each hundreds group (100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488), the tens digit 8 appears in x80-x89. Let's see how many times.\n\nFor 100-199: 180-189, which is 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, 10 occurrences.\n\nSimilarly, for 200-299:280-289, 10 occurrences.\n\nFor 300-399:380-389, 10 occurrences.\n\nFor 400-488: The tens digit 8 would be in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's in three-digit numbers:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nOnes place: The ones digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, in each hundreds group, how many times does 8 appear in the ones place?\n\nFor 100-199: Numbers ending with 8 are 108,118,...,198. That's 10 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, for 200-299:208,218,...,298:10 numbers.\n\nFor 300-399:308,318,...,398:10 numbers.\n\nFor 400-488: Numbers ending with 8 are 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Let's count: from 408 to 488, stepping by 10: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total ones place 8's in three-digit numbers:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:39 (tens) +39 (ones) =78\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nWait, let me check that:1 (single) +19 (two-digit) =20. 20 +78=98. Yes.\n\nSo, total 4's:188\n\nTotal 8's:98\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, counting 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit: tens=10, ones=9, total=19\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place:400-488=89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTens place: in 100-399, each hundreds group has 10 4's in tens place, so 3*10=30. Plus 440-449 in 400-488, which is 10, so total 40.\n\nOnes place:100-399: each hundreds group has 10 4's in ones place, so 3*10=30. Plus 400-488:9 4's in ones place, so total 39.\n\nSo, three-digit 4's:89+40+39=168\n\nTotal 4's:1+19+168=188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit: tens=10, ones=9, total=19\n\nThree-digit:\n\nTens place:100-399: each hundreds group has 10 8's in tens place, so 3*10=30. Plus 480-488:9 8's, so total 39.\n\nOnes place:100-399: each hundreds group has 10 8's in ones place, so 3*10=30. Plus 400-488:9 8's, so total 39.\n\nThree-digit 8's:39+39=78\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the three-digit tens place for 8's. In 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, ones place in 400-488: numbers ending with 8 are 408,418,...,488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, yes, 39 each for tens and ones in three-digit, totaling 78.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 4 has a 4. \u2192 1 occurrence.\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: Pages 40-49 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Ones place: Pages 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total for two-digit: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: Pages 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n     - Tens place:\n       - Pages 140-149, 240-249, 340-349 \u2192 10 each, totaling 30.\n       - Pages 440-449 \u2192 10.\n       - Total: 30 + 10 = 40.\n     - Ones place:\n       - Pages 104, 114, ..., 194 \u2192 10.\n       - Pages 204, 214, ..., 294 \u2192 10.\n       - Pages 304, 314, ..., 394 \u2192 10.\n       - Pages 404, 414, ..., 484 \u2192 9.\n       - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n     - Total for three-digit: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n   - **Total 4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 8 has an 8. \u2192 1 occurrence.\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: Pages 80-89 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Ones place: Pages 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total for two-digit: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Tens place:\n       - Pages 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 \u2192 10 each, totaling 30.\n       - Pages 480-488 \u2192 9.\n       - Total: 30 + 9 = 39.\n     - Ones place:\n       - Pages 108, 118, ..., 198 \u2192 10.\n       - Pages 208, 218, ..., 298 \u2192 10.\n       - Pages 308, 318, ..., 398 \u2192 10.\n       - Pages 408, 418, ..., 488 \u2192 9.\n       - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n     - Total for three-digit: 39 + 39 = 78.\n   - **Total 8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: 1-9. Here, the only 4 is on page 4. So that's 1 occurrence.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: 10-99. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. \n\nIn the tens place: The numbers are 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nIn the units place: The numbers are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, right? So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let me count each occurrence. From 10-99, every ten has one 4 in the units place, except maybe the 40-49 range where the tens place is already 4. So, from 10-39, 40-49, 50-79, 80-99, each ten has one 4 in the units place. But wait, 40-49 has 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place, but in the units place, it's 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49. So, in the units place, that's 10 numbers, but 44 has an extra 4 in the units place, so actually, from 10-99, how many 4's in the units place? Let me think again. For each ten (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the units digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each ten, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. Since there are 9 tens (10-99), that's 9 occurrences. But wait, from 40-49, the units digits go from 0-9, so that's another 10 numbers, but the units digit is 4 only once, at 44. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, 40-49 has 10 numbers, each with a units digit from 0-9, so the 4 in the units place occurs once in each ten. So, for 10-99, that's 9 tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 9 times. But wait, 40-49 is the fourth ten, so that's included in the 9 tens. So, units place 4's: 9 occurrences. But wait, 44 has two 4's, so that's two 4's in that number. So, in the units place, 40-49 contributes one 4 in the units place (at 44), but actually, each ten contributes one 4 in the units place, so 9 times total. But 44 has two 4's, so I think I need to account for that. Wait, maybe I should separate the tens and units places.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of 4's in the tens place and the number of 4's in the units place separately for two-digit numbers.\n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers (10-99):\n\n- The 4's in the tens place are from 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nFor the units place in two-digit numbers (10-99):\n\n- In each ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), the units digit 4 occurs once. So, that's 9 tens, each contributing one 4, so 9 occurrences. But wait, 40-49 is the fourth ten, so does that affect it? No, because in 40-49, the units digit 4 occurs at 44, which is just one occurrence. So, total units place 4's: 9.\n\nSo, total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19.\n\nWait, but 44 has two 4's, so in two-digit numbers, 44 contributes two 4's. So, in my count above, I have 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19, but 44 is included in both counts, so I'm counting it twice, which is correct because it has two 4's. So, that's okay.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100-488.\n\nI need to count the number of 4's in the hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, since the book has 488 pages.\n\n- For hundreds digit 1: 100-199. How many 4's in the hundreds place? None, because hundreds digit is 1.\n\n- For hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Similarly, hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's here.\n\n- For hundreds digit 3: 300-399. Hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Hundreds digit is 4, so each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place in three-digit numbers (100-488):\n\nWe need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers up to 488.\n\nLet's break it down by hundreds:\n\n1. Hundreds digit 1: 100-199.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 can appear in 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\n2. Hundreds digit 2: 200-299.\n\nSimilarly, 240-249: 10 numbers, 10 occurrences.\n\n3. Hundreds digit 3: 300-399.\n\n340-349: 10 numbers, 10 occurrences.\n\n4. Hundreds digit 4: 400-488.\n\nHere, the tens place can be 4, so 440-449. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 440-449 is within 400-488. So, that's 10 numbers, 10 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place across all three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40.\n\nWait, but let me check if 400-488 includes 440-449. Yes, because 440 is greater than 400 and less than 488. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, units place in three-digit numbers (100-488):\n\nWe need to count how many times 4 appears in the units place across all three-digit numbers up to 488.\n\nAgain, let's break it down by hundreds:\n\n1. Hundreds digit 1: 100-199.\n\nIn each ten (100-109, 110-119, ..., 190-199), the units digit 4 occurs once per ten. There are 10 tens, so 10 occurrences.\n\n2. Hundreds digit 2: 200-299.\n\nSimilarly, 10 tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place: 10 occurrences.\n\n3. Hundreds digit 3: 300-399.\n\nAgain, 10 tens, each with one 4 in the units place: 10 occurrences.\n\n4. Hundreds digit 4: 400-488.\n\nNow, here, the units digit 4 can occur in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488, so we stop at 484. So, how many numbers is that? Let's see: from 400-488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, starting at 404, then 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers. Wait, because 404 is the first, and then each subsequent 10 pages adds another, up to 484. So, from 404 to 484, that's (484 - 404)/10 + 1 = (80)/10 +1 = 8 +1 = 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in the units place across all three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but let me check: for hundreds digit 4, 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs at 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, correct. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total units place 4's in three-digit numbers: 10 (hundreds=1) +10 (hundreds=2)+10 (hundreds=3)+9 (hundreds=4) = 39.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: hundreds place 89 + tens place 40 + units place 39 = 89 + 40 = 129; 129 +39=168\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, in three-digit numbers, the hundreds, tens, and units are separate. So, the total 4's in three-digit numbers are:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n\n- Tens place: 40\n\n- Units place: 39\n\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. But let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, but 89 in hundreds place, 40 in tens, 39 in units: 89+40=129, 129+39=168. So, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 168.\n\nAdding the single and two-digit numbers:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:168\n\nTotal 4's: 1 +19=20; 20 +168=188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the three-digit counts. Let me go through it again.\n\nThree-digit numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's.\n\n- 200-299: hundreds digit 2, no 4's.\n\n- 300-399: hundreds digit 3, no 4's.\n\n- 400-488: hundreds digit 4. The number of numbers here is 488 - 400 +1 =89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles 0-9.\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit 4 occurs in 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). So, for hundreds 1,2,3, each contributes 10 4's in the tens place. For hundreds 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, 10+10+10+10=40.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- For each hundred, the units digit 4 occurs once per ten. So, in 100-199, there are 10 occurrences (104,114,...,194). Similarly for 200-299 and 300-399: 10 each. For 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs at 404,414,...,484. How many is that? From 404 to 484, stepping by 10: that's (484 - 404)/10 +1 = 8 +1=9. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, units place: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units)=168.\n\nAdding single-digit:1, two-digit:19, so total 4's:1+19=20; 20+168=188.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, total 4's:188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers:1-9. The only 8 is on page 8. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers:10-99.\n\nCounting 8's in tens and units places.\n\nTens place: 80-89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: In each ten (10-19,20-29,...,90-99), the units digit 8 occurs once. So, 9 tens, each contributing one 8, so 9 occurrences. But wait, 80-89 is the eighth ten, so the units digit 8 occurs at 88, which is in 80-89. So, in 80-89, the units digit 8 occurs once. So, total units place 8's:9.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19.\n\nNow, three-digit page numbers:100-488.\n\nCounting 8's in hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 100-199: hundreds digit 1, no 8's.\n\n- 200-299: hundreds digit 2, no 8's.\n\n- 300-399: hundreds digit 3, no 8's.\n\n- 400-488: hundreds digit 4, so no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, hundreds place:0 occurrences.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is only part of the tens digit 8 in the hundreds 400-488.\n\nSo, let's break it down:\n\n1. Hundreds digit 1: 100-199.\n\nTens digit 8: 180-189. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\n2. Hundreds digit 2: 200-299.\n\nTens digit 8:280-289. 10 numbers, 10 occurrences.\n\n3. Hundreds digit 3:300-399.\n\nTens digit 8:380-389. 10 numbers, 10 occurrences.\n\n4. Hundreds digit 4:400-488.\n\nTens digit 8:480-488. But wait, the tens digit is 8, so the numbers would be 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 occurrences.\n\nTherefore, total 8's in the tens place:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nUnits place in three-digit numbers:\n\nFor each hundred, the units digit 8 occurs once per ten.\n\n1. Hundreds digit 1:100-199.\n\nUnits digit 8 occurs at 108,118,...,198. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\n2. Hundreds digit 2:200-299.\n\nUnits digit 8:208,218,...,298. 10 occurrences.\n\n3. Hundreds digit 3:300-399.\n\nUnits digit 8:308,318,...,398. 10 occurrences.\n\n4. Hundreds digit 4:400-488.\n\nUnits digit 8:408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Let's count how many these are. Starting at 408, each subsequent 10 pages:408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nTherefore, total units place 8's:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place 39 + units place 39 =78.\n\nAdding single-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:78.\n\nTotal 8's:1+19=20; 20+78=98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 1+19=20, and 20+78=98. But let me check:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:78\n\nTotal 8's:1+19=20; 20+78=98.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the three-digit counts.\n\nThree-digit numbers:\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTens place:10+10+10+9=39\n\nUnits place:10+10+10+9=39\n\nTotal:39+39=78\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:188\n\nTotal 8's:98\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nWait, so the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the counts.\n\nLet me verify the counts again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19\n\nThree-digit:89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units)=168\n\nTotal:1+19+168=188\n\nFor 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19\n\nThree-digit:39 (tens) +39 (units)=78\n\nTotal:1+19+78=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the three-digit tens place for 4's again. I had 10+10+10+10=40. That's correct because in each hundred (100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488), the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times each. So, 40 in total.\n\nSimilarly, for units place in three-digit numbers, 10+10+10+9=39. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\nTens place:10+10+10+9=39\n\nUnits place:10+10+10+9=39\n\nTotal:78\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: 1 to 9. The only single-digit number that has a 4 is page 4 itself. So, that's 1 occurrence of the digit 4. \n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: 10 to 99. Here, the digits can be in the tens place or the units place. Let me separate them. \n\nFirst, the tens place. The tens digit can be 4, which would cover pages 40 to 49. That's 10 pages, each contributing one 4 in the tens place. So, that's 10 occurrences. \n\nNow, the units place. For two-digit numbers, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each set of ten (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. Since there are 9 sets of ten in the two-digit numbers (10-99), that's 9 occurrences. Wait, but actually, from 10 to 99, there are 9 tens (10s, 20s,...90s). In each, the units digit 4 appears once. So, 9 times 1 is 9. \n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. \n\nWait, but hold on. From 10-99, there are 90 numbers. So, the tens place has 4 appearing 10 times (40-49), and the units place has 4 appearing 9 times (14,24,...94). So yes, 10 + 9 = 19. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because now we have hundreds, tens, and units places. Let me handle each place separately.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\n- For hundreds digit 1: Pages 100-199. The digit 4 doesn't appear in the hundreds place here, so no contribution.\n- For hundreds digit 2: Pages 200-299. Similarly, no 4's in the hundreds place.\n- For hundreds digit 3: Pages 300-399. Again, no 4's in the hundreds place.\n- For hundreds digit 4: Pages 400-488. Here, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. So, how many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 pages has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9, and we need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place from 100-488.\n\nLet me break it down by hundreds:\n\n- For hundreds digit 1 (100-199): The tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 100 pages. So, in 100-199, the tens digit is 4 for pages 140-149. That's 10 pages, so 10 occurrences.\n- Similarly, for hundreds digit 2 (200-299): Tens digit 4 is pages 240-249. Another 10.\n- For hundreds digit 3 (300-399): Tens digit 4 is pages 340-349. Another 10.\n- For hundreds digit 4 (400-488): Tens digit 4 is pages 440-449. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 400-488. So that's 10 pages, but wait, 488 is beyond 449, so yes, 440-449 is 10 pages. So, 10 occurrences.\n\nSo, in the tens place across all three-digit numbers, we have 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 occurrences.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. The units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 pages. So, in each hundred, the units digit 4 appears once every 10 pages. Let's calculate for each hundred:\n\n- For hundreds digit 1 (100-199): The units digit 4 appears in 104,114,124,...,194. That's 10 occurrences.\n- Similarly, for hundreds digit 2 (200-299): 204,214,...,294. 10 occurrences.\n- For hundreds digit 3 (300-399): 304,314,...,394. 10 occurrences.\n- For hundreds digit 4 (400-488): Now, here, we have to be careful because we don't go up to 499, only 488. So, the units digit 4 appears in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Wait, let's count: starting at 404, each 10 pages. So, 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 occurrences because 484 +10 would be 494, which is beyond 488. So, only 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, adding up: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 occurrences in the units place.\n\nTherefore, for three-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 40\n- Units place: 39\nTotal = 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) = 129, plus 39 (units) is indeed 168.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: 1-9. The only single-digit number with an 8 is page 8. So, that's 1 occurrence.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: 10-99.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 for pages 80-89. That's 10 pages, so 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: In two-digit numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 pages. So, for each ten (10-19,20-29,...90-99), the units digit 8 appears once. There are 9 such tens (10s to 90s), so 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but actually, from 10-99, there are 9 sets of ten, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, the total number of 8's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1,2,3, or 4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place, so 0 occurrences.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 for certain pages. Let's break it down by hundreds.\n\n- For hundreds digit 1 (100-199): Tens digit 8 is pages 180-189. That's 10 pages, so 10 occurrences.\n- For hundreds digit 2 (200-299): Tens digit 8 is pages 280-289. 10 occurrences.\n- For hundreds digit 3 (300-399): Tens digit 8 is pages 380-389. 10 occurrences.\n- For hundreds digit 4 (400-488): Tens digit 8 is pages 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. That's 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nUnits place: The units digit 8 appears once every 10 pages. Let's count for each hundred.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1 (100-199): Units digit 8 appears in 108,118,128,...,198. That's 10 occurrences.\n- Hundreds digit 2 (200-299): 208,218,...,298. 10 occurrences.\n- Hundreds digit 3 (300-399): 308,318,...,398. 10 occurrences.\n- Hundreds digit 4 (400-488): Units digit 8 appears in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Let's count: starting at 408, each 10 pages. 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 occurrences because 488 is included, and the next would be 498, which is beyond 488.\n\nSo, units place occurrences: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nTherefore, for three-digit numbers, the total number of 8's is:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 39\n- Units place: 39\nTotal = 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's and 8's across all page numbers.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal = 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal = 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n- Three-digit: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n- Three-digit: 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Single-digit (1-9):** 1 occurrence (page 4).\n- **Two-digit (10-99):** \n  - Tens place: 10 occurrences (40-49).\n  - Units place: 9 occurrences (14, 24, ..., 94).\n  - Total: 19.\n- **Three-digit (100-488):**\n  - Hundreds place: 89 occurrences (400-488).\n  - Tens place: 40 occurrences (140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n  - Units place: 39 occurrences (104, 114, ..., 484).\n  - Total: 168.\n- **Total 4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Single-digit (1-9):** 1 occurrence (page 8).\n- **Two-digit (10-99):**\n  - Tens place: 10 occurrences (80-89).\n  - Units place: 9 occurrences (18, 28, ..., 98).\n  - Total: 19.\n- **Three-digit (100-488):**\n  - Tens place: 39 occurrences (180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488).\n  - Units place: 39 occurrences (108, 118, ..., 488).\n  - Total: 78.\n- **Total 8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: 1 to 9. The digit 4 appears once here, which is on page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence of 4.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers: 10 to 99. Here, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers from 40 to 49 each have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4.\n\nFor the units place: The 4 can appear in the units place for numbers like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, ..., 94. Let me count these. From 10 to 99, every ten numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, but wait, 44 has two 4's. So, does that mean I should count each occurrence? Wait, no. Because in the units place, each of these numbers contributes one 4, regardless of the tens digit. So, from 10 to 99, there are 9 numbers where the units digit is 4, each contributing one 4. So that's 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 44 is one of those, so it's counted once in the units place and once in the tens place. So, in total, for two-digit numbers, the number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19.\n\nWait, but actually, from 10 to 99, how many numbers have a 4 in the units place? It's 9 numbers: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. So that's 9. But 44 is included in both counts, so when I add 10 (tens place) and 9 (units place), I get 19, but 44 is counted twice. So, the total number of 4's in two-digit numbers is 19.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I count the tens place, 40-49: 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place, so 10 4's. Then, in the units place, 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94: that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 9 4's. So, total 10 + 9 = 19 4's in two-digit numbers. But 44 is counted in both, so it's two 4's in that number, which is correct because we're counting each digit separately. So, 19 is correct.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100 to 488. Here, each page number is a three-digit number, with hundreds, tens, and units digits. I need to count the number of 4's in each place.\n\nFirst, let's count the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nIn the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences of 4.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit can be 0-9 for each hundred. So, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nFor 100-199: The tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in 100-199, the tens digit is 4 in 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 200-299: The tens digit is 4 in 240-249, another 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nFor 300-399: The tens digit is 4 in 340-349, another 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nFor 400-488: The tens digit is 4 in 440-449. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 400-488. So, that's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nSo, total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 occurrences of 4.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. From 400-488, the tens digit can go up to 8, but in the tens place, 4 is only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, the units place. The units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, in each hundred, for each ten, there's a units digit of 4. So, for each hundred, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nFrom 100-199: In each ten (like 100-109, 110-119, etc.), the units digit is 4 once every ten numbers. There are 10 tens in each hundred, so 10 occurrences per hundred.\n\nSimilarly, for 200-299: 10 occurrences.\n\nFor 300-399: 10 occurrences.\n\nFor 400-488: Now, 400-488 is 89 numbers. The units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, how many complete tens are there? 480-488 is the last part. So, from 400-488, how many times does the units digit 4 appear?\n\nWell, in each ten (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488), the units digit 4 appears once per ten. So, how many tens are there in 400-488? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, which is 8 full tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479) and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in each of the 8 full tens, the units digit 4 appears once, so 8 times. In the last partial ten (480-488), does the units digit 4 appear? Yes, at 484. So, that's one more occurrence. So, total in 400-488: 8 + 1 = 9 occurrences of 4 in the units place.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check that again. From 400-488, the units digit 4 appears at 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, for the units place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-199: 10\n- 200-299: 10\n- 300-399: 10\n- 400-488: 9\n\nTotal: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 occurrences of 4 in the units place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 40\n- Units place: 39\n\nTotal 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, let me check that addition: 89 + 40 = 129, then 129 + 39 = 168. Yes.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 4)\nTwo-digit: 19 (as calculated earlier)\nThree-digit: 168\n\n1 + 19 = 20, 20 + 168 = 188. Hmm.\n\nNow, moving on to counting the number of 8's. I'll do the same process.\n\nSingle-digit page numbers: 1-9. The digit 8 appears once, on page 8.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers: 10-99.\n\nFirst, tens place: The numbers from 80-89 have 8 in the tens place, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: The 8 appears in the units place for numbers like 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nBut wait, 88 is included in both counts, so it's two 8's in that number, which is correct because we're counting each digit separately.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19.\n\nNow, three-digit page numbers: 100-488.\n\nAgain, hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the hundreds digit can't be 8 in a three-digit number less than 500. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit is 8 in the ranges 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nFor 100-199: 180-189: 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nFor 200-299: 280-289: 10 occurrences.\n\nFor 300-399: 380-389: 10 occurrences.\n\nFor 400-488: The tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: The units digit is 8 in numbers like 108,118,128,..., up to 488.\n\nFor each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the units digit 8 appears once every ten numbers.\n\nIn 100-199: 108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198. That's 10 occurrences.\n\nIn 200-299: Similarly, 208,218,...,298: 10 occurrences.\n\nIn 300-399: 308,318,...,398: 10 occurrences.\n\nIn 400-488: The units digit 8 appears at 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 occurrences because 488 is included, but 488 is the last page. So, from 400-488, the units digit 8 appears at 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488: that's 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total in the units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 occurrences.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check 400-488. The units digit 8 appears at 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Tens place: 39\n- Units place: 39\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me add them again: 1 + 19 = 20, 20 + 78 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's.\n\nNumber of 4's: 188\nNumber of 8's: 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFirst, checking the number of 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 4)\nTwo-digit: 19\nThree-digit: 168\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 8)\nTwo-digit: 19\nThree-digit: 78\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I feel like that might be high. Let me check the three-digit counts again.\n\nIn three-digit numbers, for 4's:\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: In each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit is 4 in 10 numbers each, except for 400-488 where it's 10 numbers (440-449). Wait, earlier I thought 400-488's tens digit 4 is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 10 in each hundred, 4 hundreds, so 40.\n\nUnits place: In each hundred, 10 occurrences, except for 400-488 where it's 9. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTens place: 10 in each of the first three hundreds, and 9 in 400-488, so 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nUnits place: 10 in each of the first three hundreds, and 9 in 400-488, so 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nTotal 8's in three-digit: 39 + 39 = 78. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, 8's: 98. Difference: 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 4 has a '4', so 1 occurrence.\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: Pages 40-49 (10 numbers), so 10 '4's.\n     - Units place: Pages 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94 (9 numbers), so 9 '4's.\n     - Total for two-digit: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: Pages 400-488 (89 numbers), so 89 '4's.\n     - Tens place: Each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) has 10 '4's in the tens place, totaling 40.\n     - Units place: Each hundred has 10 '4's except 400-488, which has 9, totaling 39.\n     - Total for three-digit: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n   - **Total '4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 8 has an '8', so 1 occurrence.\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: Pages 80-89 (10 numbers), so 10 '8's.\n     - Units place: Pages 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98 (9 numbers), so 9 '8's.\n     - Total for two-digit: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: No '8's since pages go up to 488.\n     - Tens place: Each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) has 10 '8's in the tens place except 400-488, which has 9, totaling 39.\n     - Units place: Each hundred has 10 '8's except 400-488, which has 9, totaling 39.\n     - Total for three-digit: 39 + 39 = 78.\n   - **Total '8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: The only single-digit page that has a 4 is page 4 itself. So, that's 1 occurrence of the digit 4. \n\nNow, moving on to two-digit page numbers, which range from 10 to 99. Here, the digit 4 can appear in the tens place or the units place. Let's consider each case separately. \n\nFirst, the tens place: The tens digit is 4, so the pages would be from 40 to 49. That's 10 pages where 4 appears in the tens place. So, that's 10 occurrences of the digit 4. \n\nNext, the units place: The units digit is 4, and this happens every 10 pages. So, starting from 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but in the two-digit numbers, the tens digit can't be more than 9, so up to 94. Let me count them: 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers. But wait, 44 has two 4's, right? So, does that count as two 4's? Hmm, yes, because each digit is counted separately. So, in 44, both the tens and units digits are 4, so that adds two more 4's. But when I counted the tens place, I already included the 44 in the tens place count. Similarly, when I count the units place, I include 44 again. So, in total, for two-digit numbers, the number of 4's is 10 (from the tens place) plus 9 (from the units place), but wait, 44 is counted twice here. So, the total number of 4's in two-digit numbers is 10 + 9 = 19, but actually, 44 contributes two 4's, so the total is 19 digits. Wait, no, let me think again. When I count the tens place, I have 10 pages (40-49) where the tens digit is 4, each contributing one 4. That's 10 4's. Then, for the units place, from 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94, that's 9 pages, each contributing one 4, but 44 already had a 4 in the tens place. So, in total, the units place adds 9 more 4's. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers are 10 + 9 = 19. \n\nWait, but 44 is one of those units place numbers, so does that mean we're double-counting? Yes, but that's okay because each digit is counted separately. So, 44 has two 4's, so it's correct to count both. So, 10 from tens, 9 from units, total 19 4's in two-digit numbers. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Here, the digit 4 can appear in the hundreds place, tens place, or units place. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4, so pages from 400 to 488. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences of the digit 4.\n\nNext, the tens place: The tens digit is 4. So, we need to consider all three-digit numbers where the tens digit is 4, regardless of the hundreds and units digits. However, since the book ends at 488, we have to be careful. Let's think about it. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're looking for tens digit 4, let's consider each hundred separately.\n\nFor hundreds digit 1: The tens digit is 4, so numbers from 140 to 149. That's 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. So, 10 4's.\n\nFor hundreds digit 2: Similarly, 240 to 249. Another 10 numbers, 10 4's.\n\nFor hundreds digit 3: 340 to 349. Another 10 numbers, 10 4's.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: 440 to 449. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440 to 449 is within the range. That's another 10 numbers, 10 4's.\n\nSo, in total, the tens place contributes 10 (hundreds=1) + 10 (hundreds=2) + 10 (hundreds=3) + 10 (hundreds=4) = 40 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the units place: The units digit is 4. Again, considering all three-digit numbers where the units digit is 4, and the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, and the tens digit can be 0-9, but we have to make sure we don't exceed 488.\n\nLet's break it down by hundreds digit:\n\nFor hundreds digit 1: The units digit is 4, so numbers from 104, 114, 124, ..., 194. How many are there? From 104 to 194, stepping by 10, so (194 - 104)/10 + 1 = (90)/10 + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10 numbers. So, 10 4's in the units place for hundreds digit 1.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digit 2: 204, 214, ..., 294. Again, 10 numbers, 10 4's.\n\nFor hundreds digit 3: 304, 314, ..., 394. 10 numbers, 10 4's.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: Now, we have to be careful because the book ends at 488. So, the units digit is 4, so numbers would be 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, let me count: starting at 404, then 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. So, 9 4's in the units place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, total units place 4's in three-digit numbers: 10 (hundreds=1) + 10 (hundreds=2) + 10 (hundreds=3) + 9 (hundreds=4) = 39 4's.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. For hundreds digit 4, units digit 4, the numbers are 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Yes, that's 9 numbers because the next one would be 494, which is beyond 488. So, 9 instead of 10.\n\nSo, total units place 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place 89 + tens place 40 + units place 39 = 89 + 40 = 129 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me check that again. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. Tens place: 40 in total, as calculated earlier. Units place: 39. So, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's in the entire book:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 168\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 = 20 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, 1 + 19 is 20, plus 168 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I need to count how many times 8 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: The only single-digit page with an 8 is page 8. So, that's 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers: 10-99. The digit 8 can appear in the tens place or the units place.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8, so pages from 80 to 89. That's 10 pages, each contributing one 8 in the tens place. So, 10 8's.\n\nUnits place: The units digit is 8, so numbers like 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Wait, but 88 has two 8's, so does that mean we're double-counting? Yes, but each digit is counted separately. So, 88 contributes two 8's, one in the tens place and one in the units place. But in the tens place count, we've already included 88 as part of the 80-89 range. So, when counting the units place, 88 is included again. So, the total number of 8's in the units place is 9, but 88 is counted twice. So, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. Wait, but 88 is in both counts, so the total 8's are 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19, but 88 is counted twice, so the actual total is 19 digits, which is correct because 88 has two 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nNow, three-digit page numbers: 100-488. The digit 8 can appear in the hundreds, tens, or units place.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8. So, we need to consider all three-digit numbers where the tens digit is 8, regardless of the hundreds and units digits, but within the range of 100 to 488.\n\nLet's break it down by hundreds digit:\n\nFor hundreds digit 1: Tens digit 8, so numbers from 180 to 189. That's 10 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the tens place. So, 10 8's.\n\nFor hundreds digit 2: 280 to 289. Another 10 numbers, 10 8's.\n\nFor hundreds digit 3: 380 to 389. Another 10 numbers, 10 8's.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: 480 to 488. Here, the tens digit is 8, so numbers from 480 to 488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Each of these contributes one 8 in the tens place. So, 9 8's.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 (hundreds=1) + 10 (hundreds=2) + 10 (hundreds=3) + 9 (hundreds=4) = 39 8's.\n\nNow, units place: The units digit is 8. So, we need to count all three-digit numbers where the units digit is 8, with hundreds digit 1, 2, 3, or 4, and tens digit 0-9, but within the range of 100 to 488.\n\nLet's break it down by hundreds digit:\n\nFor hundreds digit 1: Units digit 8, so numbers 108, 118, 128, ..., 198. That's 10 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 10 8's.\n\nFor hundreds digit 2: 208, 218, ..., 298. Another 10 numbers, 10 8's.\n\nFor hundreds digit 3: 308, 318, ..., 398. Another 10 numbers, 10 8's.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: Units digit 8, so numbers 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. Wait, let's count: starting at 408, then 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is the last one before 489, which is beyond 488. So, 9 8's in the units place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, total units place 8's: 10 (hundreds=1) + 10 (hundreds=2) + 10 (hundreds=3) + 9 (hundreds=4) = 39 8's.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place 39 + units place 39 = 78.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me make sure. Tens place: 39, units place: 39. So, total 39 + 39 = 78 8's in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's in the entire book:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 78\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 = 20 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, 1 + 19 is 20, plus 78 is 98. So, 98 8's in total.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 188\n\nTotal 8's: 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, checking the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (correct)\n\nTwo-digit: tens place 10 (40-49) + units place 9 (14,24,...,94) = 19 (correct)\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's (correct)\n\nTens place: 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449) = 40 (correct)\n\nUnits place: 10 (104,114,...,194) + 10 (204,214,...,294) + 10 (304,314,...,394) + 9 (404,414,...,484) = 39 (correct)\n\nTotal three-digit 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 (correct)\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188 (correct)\n\nNow, checking the 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (correct)\n\nTwo-digit: tens place 10 (80-89) + units place 9 (18,28,...,98) = 19 (correct)\n\nThree-digit:\n\nTens place: 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 39 (correct)\n\nUnits place: 10 (108,118,...,198) + 10 (208,218,...,298) + 10 (308,318,...,398) + 9 (408,418,...,488) = 39 (correct)\n\nTotal three-digit 8's: 39 + 39 = 78 (correct)\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98 (correct)\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Here, the digit 4 can appear in the tens place or the units place. Let's calculate each separately. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers would be 40-49. That's 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. So, 10 fours. \n\nFor the units place: The numbers would be 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, but I'm only counting the units place here, so each of these contributes one 4. Let me count them: from 14 to 94, every 10 numbers, so that's 9 numbers, each with a 4 in the units place. So, 9 fours. \n\nWait, but 44 is included in both the tens and units counts. So, for the two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 fours. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers: from 100 to 488. Here, the digit 4 can appear in the hundreds place, the tens place, or the units place. Let's handle each case.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're only considering up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\n- For hundreds digit 1: The numbers are 100-199. In this range, how many times does 4 appear? It can appear in the tens or units place. Let me think. Wait, I'm only counting 4's in the hundreds place here, but since the hundreds digit is 1, there are no 4's in the hundreds place for 100-199. So, zero fours here.\n\n- For hundreds digit 2: Similarly, numbers 200-299. Again, hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's in the hundreds place. Zero fours.\n\n- For hundreds digit 3: Numbers 300-399. Hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's in the hundreds place. Zero fours.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4: Numbers 400-488. Here, the hundreds digit is 4, so every number from 400 to 488 contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours from the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me double-check. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's indeed 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9, and we're looking for when it's 4. Let's break this down by hundreds.\n\n- For hundreds digit 1: 100-199. The tens digit is 4 in the range 140-149. That's 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. So, 10 fours.\n\n- For hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Similarly, 240-249. Another 10 fours.\n\n- For hundreds digit 3: 300-399. 340-349. Another 10 fours.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4: 400-488. The tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 fours. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? So, 10 fours here.\n\nSo, total fours in the tens place across all three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 fours.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 occurs exactly once every 100 numbers, which is 10 times. So, for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, that's 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 30 fours. Then, for 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so another 10 fours. So total tens place fours: 30 + 10 = 40 fours. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. The units digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, the units digit 4 occurs once every 10 numbers. Let's calculate for each hundred.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 100-199. The units digit 4 occurs in 104, 114, 124, ..., 194. That's 10 numbers, so 10 fours.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Similarly, 204, 214, ..., 294. Another 10 fours.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3: 300-399. 304, 314, ..., 394. Another 10 fours.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: 400-488. The units digit 4 occurs in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, how many is that? Let me count: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, because 484 is the last one before 488. So, 9 fours here.\n\nSo, total units place fours: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 fours.\n\nWait, but wait a second. From 400 to 488, how many times does the units digit 4 occur? Let me think: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Yes, that's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488, and the next would be 494, which is beyond 488. So, 9 fours in the units place for the 400-488 range.\n\nSo, total units place fours in three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nNow, adding up all the fours in three-digit numbers: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89 + 40 = 129, plus 39 is 168 fours.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) = 129, plus 39 (units) gives 168. So, 168 fours in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, adding the single-digit and two-digit numbers: single-digit had 1 four, two-digit had 19 fours, so total before three-digit is 1 + 19 = 20 fours. Then, adding the three-digit fours: 20 + 168 = 188 fours in total.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check the three-digit numbers. Hundreds place: 89 fours, tens place: 40 fours, units place: 39 fours. 89 + 40 = 129, plus 39 is 168. Then, single-digit and two-digit: 1 + 19 = 20. So total 20 + 168 = 188 fours. Hmm, maybe that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to counting the number of 8's. Let's do the same process.\n\nSingle-digit page numbers: from 1 to 9. The only single-digit number with an 8 is 8 itself. So, that's one 8.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: from 10 to 99. The digit 8 can appear in the tens place or the units place.\n\nTens place: The numbers are 80-89. That's 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, 10 eights.\n\nUnits place: The numbers are 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. Wait, but 88 has two 8's, but I'm only counting the units place here, so each of these contributes one 8. Let's count: from 18 to 98, every 10 numbers, so that's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the units place. So, 9 eights.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, the total number of 8's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 eights.\n\nNow, three-digit numbers: from 100 to 488. The digit 8 can appear in the hundreds, tens, or units place.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place for any three-digit number in this book. So, zero eights here.\n\nTens place: Let's break it down by hundreds.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 100-199. The tens digit is 8 in 180-189. That's 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, 10 eights.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Similarly, 280-289. Another 10 eights.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3: 300-399. 380-389. Another 10 eights.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: 400-488. The tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, how many eights? The tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights.\n\nWait, but let me think: 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, 9 eights here.\n\nSo, total tens place eights: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 eights.\n\nNow, units place in three-digit numbers. The units digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, the units digit 8 occurs once every 10 numbers.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 100-199. The units digit 8 occurs in 108, 118, 128, 138, 148, 158, 168, 178, 188, 198. That's 10 numbers, so 10 eights.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Similarly, 208, 218, ..., 298. Another 10 eights.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3: 300-399. 308, 318, ..., 398. Another 10 eights.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: 400-488. The units digit 8 occurs in 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. Let me count: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers, because 488 is the last one before 489, which is beyond 488. So, 9 eights here.\n\nSo, total units place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 eights.\n\nNow, adding up all the eights in three-digit numbers: tens place (39) + units place (39) = 78 eights.\n\nAdding the single-digit and two-digit numbers: single-digit had 1 eight, two-digit had 19 eights, so total before three-digit is 1 + 19 = 20 eights. Then, adding the three-digit eights: 20 + 78 = 98 eights in total.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Single-digit: 1, two-digit: 19, three-digit: 78. So, 1 + 19 = 20, plus 78 is 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours: 188, total eights: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n\n- Two-digit: 19\n\n- Three-digit: 168\n\nTotal: 1 + 19 = 20, 20 + 168 = 188.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n\n- Two-digit: 19\n\n- Three-digit: 78\n\nTotal: 1 + 19 = 20, 20 + 78 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the three-digit counts. Let me verify the three-digit fours and eights again.\n\nThree-digit fours:\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\n- Tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 fours. Wait, earlier I thought 400-488 contributes 10 fours in the tens place, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's correct.\n\n- Units place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 fours.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 fours in three-digit numbers. That seems correct.\n\nThree-digit eights:\n\n- Tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 eights.\n\n- Units place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 eights.\n\nSo, 39 + 39 = 78 eights in three-digit numbers. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total fours: 188, total eights: 98. Difference: 90.\n\nWait, but I'm thinking that 90 seems a bit high. Let me check if I counted correctly in the three-digit units place for fours and eights.\n\nFor units place fours in three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-199: 104,114,...,194: 10 numbers.\n\n- 200-299: 204,214,...,294: 10 numbers.\n\n- 300-399: 304,314,...,394: 10 numbers.\n\n- 400-488: 404,414,...,484: 9 numbers.\n\nTotal: 10+10+10+9=39 fours. Correct.\n\nUnits place eights in three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-199: 108,118,...,198: 10 numbers.\n\n- 200-299: 208,218,...,298: 10 numbers.\n\n- 300-399: 308,318,...,398: 10 numbers.\n\n- 400-488: 408,418,...,488: 9 numbers.\n\nTotal: 10+10+10+9=39 eights. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the counts seem accurate. Therefore, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"how many more 4's are printed than 8's.\" So, the answer is 90.\n\nBut I'm a bit concerned because 90 seems like a large number, but given that 4 appears in the hundreds place for 89 numbers, that's a significant contribution. So, maybe it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the three-digit counts. Let me check the three-digit fours again.\n\nThree-digit fours:\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 fours.\n\n- Tens place: 100-199: 140-149: 10 fours.\n\n200-299: 240-249: 10 fours.\n\n300-399: 340-349: 10 fours.\n\n400-488: 440-449: 10 fours.\n\nTotal tens place fours: 10+10+10+10=40.\n\nUnits place fours:\n\n100-199: 104,114,...,194: 10 fours.\n\n200-299: 204,214,...,294: 10 fours.\n\n300-399: 304,314,...,394: 10 fours.\n\n400-488: 404,414,...,484: 9 fours.\n\nTotal units place fours: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168 fours in three-digit numbers.\n\nSimilarly, for eights:\n\nThree-digit eights:\n\nTens place:\n\n100-199: 180-189: 10 eights.\n\n200-299: 280-289: 10 eights.\n\n300-399: 380-389: 10 eights.\n\n400-488: 480-488: 9 eights.\n\nTotal tens place eights: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nUnits place eights:\n\n100-199: 108,118,...,198: 10 eights.\n\n200-299: 208,218,...,298: 10 eights.\n\n300-399: 308,318,...,398: 10 eights.\n\n400-488: 408,418,...,488: 9 eights.\n\nTotal units place eights: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, 39+39=78 eights in three-digit numbers.\n\nAdding single and two-digit:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 four, 1 eight.\n\nTwo-digit: 19 fours, 19 eights.\n\nThree-digit: 168 fours, 78 eights.\n\nTotal fours: 1+19+168=188.\n\nTotal eights: 1+19+78=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nYes, I think that's correct.

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let's look at the units place. For every 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles through 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once. For example, from 1-10, the 4 appears once (at page 4). From 11-20, it appears once at page 14, and so on. So, how many sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and an extra 8 pages. In each full set of 10, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 fours. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), we need to check if there's a 4 in the units place. The pages are 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, page 484 has a 4 in the units place, which adds one more. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 40-49, each page has a 4 in the tens place. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each full hundred, there are 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), how many fours are there in the tens place? The tens digit is 4 from 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So, that's 10 numbers (440, 441, ..., 449). So, that's another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488. So, how many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 pages has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours.\n\nAdding up all the fours: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. Starting with the units place. Similar to fours, in each set of 10, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, 48 full sets of 10, which gives 48 eights. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), we check for 8 in the units place. The pages are 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, page 488 has an 8 in the units place, adding one more. So, total units place eights are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place for 8. In each hundred, the tens digit is 8 from 80-89, so that's 10 eights per hundred. There are 4 full hundreds, so 4 x 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, that's 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but 480 is part of the 401-488 range, so from 480-488, the tens digit is 8. So, that's 9 numbers, right? Because 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 pages, not 10, since 480 is included. So, that's 9 eights. Therefore, total tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place for 8. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, and before that, it's 1, 2, 3. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. Therefore, no eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** In each set of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once. There are 48 full sets of 10 in 488 pages, contributing 48 fours. The remaining 8 pages (481-488) include one more 4 (at 484), totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** In each set of 100 pages, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (e.g., 40-49). With 4 full hundreds, this gives 40 fours. The last partial hundred (401-488) includes 10 fours (440-449), adding 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 have 4 as the hundreds digit, contributing 89 fours.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** Similarly, each set of 10 contributes one 8, totaling 48. The last 8 pages include one more 8 (at 488), totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** Each set of 100 contributes 10 eights (e.g., 80-89), totaling 40. The last partial hundred (401-488) includes 9 eights (480-488), adding 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page number has 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Here, the 4 can appear in the tens place or the units place. Let's count the 4's in the tens place first. The numbers from 40 to 49 each have a 4 in the tens place, so that's 10 numbers, each contributing one 4. So that's 10 4's. Then, in the units place, the 4 appears in 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, and 94. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, so I have to be careful not to double count.

So, in the units place, it's 9 4's, but since 44 was already counted in the tens place, I think I should just count each occurrence. Wait, maybe a better approach is to count each digit separately. So, for two-digit numbers, the tens place can be 4, which gives 10 numbers (40-49), each contributing one 4. The units place can be 4, which occurs once every ten numbers, so from 10-99, that's 9 times (14,24,...,94), but wait, 44 is included here as well, so that's 9 4's in the units place. So total 4's in two-digit numbers would be 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 4's. \n\nWait, but 44 is counted twice here, once in the tens and once in the units. So actually, the total number of 4's in two-digit numbers is 10 + 9 = 19, which includes the two 4's in 44. So that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers, from 100 to 488. Let's break this down by hundreds, tens, and units places. \n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. For each hundred, we can count the number of 4's in each digit place.\n\nBut since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit goes from 1 to 4. Let's consider each hundred separately.\n\n1. Hundreds digit 1: 100-199\n2. Hundreds digit 2: 200-299\n3. Hundreds digit 3: 300-399\n4. Hundreds digit 4: 400-488\n\nFor each of these, we'll count the number of 4's in the hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nStarting with hundreds digit 1 (100-199):\n- Hundreds place: 0 4's because it's 1.\n- Tens place: 4's can appear in the tens digit. So from 100-199, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So for each hundred, the tens digit being 4 occurs 10 times (140-149). Each of these contributes one 4 in the tens place, so that's 10 4's.\n- Units place: Similarly, the units digit can be 4, so in each hundred, the units digit 4 occurs once every ten numbers, so 10 times (104,114,124,...,194). So that's another 10 4's.\nTotal for hundreds digit 1: 0 + 10 + 10 = 20 4's.\n\nHundreds digit 2 (200-299):\n- Hundreds place: 0 4's.\n- Tens place: Again, 140-149 would be in 200-299? Wait no, 200-299, so the tens digit 4 occurs in 240-249, which is 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. So 10 4's.\n- Units place: Similarly, units digit 4 occurs in 204,214,224,...,294, which is 10 numbers. So 10 4's.\nTotal for hundreds digit 2: 0 + 10 + 10 = 20 4's.\n\nHundreds digit 3 (300-399):\n- Hundreds place: 0 4's.\n- Tens place: 340-349, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place.\n- Units place: 304,314,324,...,394, which is 10 numbers. So 10 4's.\nTotal for hundreds digit 3: 0 + 10 + 10 = 20 4's.\n\nNow, hundreds digit 4 (400-488):\n- Hundreds place: Every number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each contributes one 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n- Tens place: Now, in the tens digit, we need to count how many times 4 appears. Let's consider the range 400-488. The tens digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the last). So, the tens digit is 4 in the numbers 440-449. That's 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. So that's 10 4's.\n- Units place: Similarly, the units digit can be 4 in numbers like 404,414,424,...,484. Let's see how many there are. From 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs once every ten numbers. So starting at 404, then 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, but 444 is included here. So how many numbers is that? Let's see: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, but wait, 484 is within 488, so yes. So that's 9 4's in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me check: From 400-488, the units digit cycles every 10. So starting at 404, adding 10 each time: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 494, which would be beyond 488. So 9 4's in the units place.\n\nWait, but 484 is within 488, so yes, that's correct. So units place gives 9 4's.\n\nSo total for hundreds digit 4:\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 10\n- Units place: 9\nTotal: 89 + 10 + 9 = 108 4's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. So in the hundreds digit 4, we have 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. Then, in the tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place. Then, in the units place, from 404,414,...,484, which is 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 494, which is beyond 488. So yes, 9 units digits.\n\nSo total 4's in three-digit numbers:\n- Hundreds digit 1: 20\n- Hundreds digit 2: 20\n- Hundreds digit 3: 20\n- Hundreds digit 4: 108\nTotal: 20 + 20 + 20 + 108 = 168 4's.\n\nWait, but let me add that again: 20+20=40, 40+20=60, 60+108=168. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9): Only page 8 has an 8, so that's one 8.\n\nTwo-digit numbers (10-99):\n- Tens place: 80-89, which is 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So 10 8's.\n- Units place: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the units place. But wait, 88 has two 8's, so we have to count both. So in the units place, it's 9 numbers, but 88 is included, so the total 8's in the units place are 9, but 88 contributes two 8's. Wait, but when counting the units place, each occurrence is a separate digit, so 18 has one 8, 28 has one, etc., including 88, which has one 8 in the units place. So actually, the units place contributes 9 8's, but 88 is counted once here and once in the tens place. So total 8's in two-digit numbers would be 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. For the units place, from 10-99, the units digit 8 occurs once every ten numbers, so 9 times (18,28,...,98). That's 9 8's in the units place. The tens place has 80-89, which is 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place, so 10 8's. So total 19 8's in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers (100-488). Let's break this down similarly.\n\nHundreds digit 1 (100-199):\n- Hundreds place: 0 8's.\n- Tens place: 180-189, which is 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So 10 8's.\n- Units place: 108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198. Wait, from 100-199, units digit 8 occurs in 108,118,...,198, which is 10 numbers. So 10 8's in the units place.\nTotal for hundreds digit 1: 0 + 10 + 10 = 20 8's.\n\nHundreds digit 2 (200-299):\n- Hundreds place: 0 8's.\n- Tens place: 280-289, which is 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So 10 8's.\n- Units place: 208,218,228,238,248,258,268,278,288,298. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the units place.\nTotal for hundreds digit 2: 0 + 10 + 10 = 20 8's.\n\nHundreds digit 3 (300-399):\n- Hundreds place: 0 8's.\n- Tens place: 380-389, which is 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So 10 8's.\n- Units place: 308,318,328,338,348,358,368,378,388,398. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the units place.\nTotal for hundreds digit 3: 0 + 10 + 10 = 20 8's.\n\nHundreds digit 4 (400-488):\n- Hundreds place: 0 8's because the hundreds digit is 4.\n- Tens place: 480-489, but wait, our upper limit is 488, so it's 480-488. The tens digit is 8 in 480-488, but let's check how many numbers that is. From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. Each of these has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 8's in the tens place.\n- Units place: Now, units digit 8 in 400-488. So numbers like 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Let's count these. Starting at 408, adding 10 each time: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers. So 9 8's in the units place.\n\nWait, but 488 is included here, so yes, that's 9 numbers.\n\nSo total for hundreds digit 4:\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 9\n- Units place: 9\nTotal: 0 + 9 + 9 = 18 8's.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. From 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Each has an 8 in the tens place, so 9 8's. In the units place, units digit 8 occurs in 408,418,...,488, which is 9 numbers, as above. So yes, 9 each, totaling 18 8's.\n\nSo total 8's in three-digit numbers:\n- Hundreds digit 1: 20\n- Hundreds digit 2: 20\n- Hundreds digit 3: 20\n- Hundreds digit 4: 18\nTotal: 20 + 20 + 20 + 18 = 78 8's.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 20+20=40, 40+20=60, 60+18=78. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's and 8's.\n\nTotal 4's:\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that: 1 + 19 = 20, 20 + 168 = 188. Yes.\n\nTotal 8's:\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, 1 + 19 = 20, 20 + 78 = 98. Yes.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So we subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each part again quickly.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n- Three-digit:\n  - Hundreds 1: 10 (tens) +10 (units) =20\n  - Hundreds 2: same as above, 20\n  - Hundreds 3: same, 20\n  - Hundreds 4: 89 (hundreds) +10 (tens) +9 (units) =108\nTotal three-digit 4's: 20+20+20+108=168\nTotal 4's:1+19+168=188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19\n- Three-digit:\n  - Hundreds 1:10 (tens) +10 (units)=20\n  - Hundreds 2: same,20\n  - Hundreds 3: same,20\n  - Hundreds 4:9 (tens) +9 (units)=18\nTotal three-digit 8's:20+20+20+18=78\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference between their counts.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 4, so 1 occurrence.\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: Pages 40-49 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: Pages 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n     - Tens place: Pages 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 4 sets of 10, but only 440-449 is within 488, so 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: Pages 104, 114, ..., 484 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total: 89 + 10 + 9 = 108.\n   - **Total '4's:** 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 108 (three-digit) = 128.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 8, so 1 occurrence.\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: Pages 80-89 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: None, since hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n     - Tens place: Pages 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 4 sets, but only 480-488 is within 488, so 9 occurrences.\n     - Units place: Pages 108, 118, ..., 488 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total: 9 (tens) + 9 (units) = 18.\n   - **Total '8's:** 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 18 (three-digit) = 38.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 128\n   - Number of '8's: 38\n   - Difference: 128 - 38 = 90\n\n**Answer:**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
