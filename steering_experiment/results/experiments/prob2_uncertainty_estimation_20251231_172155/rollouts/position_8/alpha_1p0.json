    "text": " Maybe I can break it down by the number of digits. \n\nFirst, single-digit page numbers: 1-9. The digit 4 appears once here, on page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence. Now, two-digit page numbers: 10-99. I think I can separate the tens place and the units place. For the tens place, the 4 can appear in 40-49. That's 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place, so that's 10 occurrences. For the units place, the 4 can appear in every set of ten, like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, from 10-99, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, from 10 to 99, that's 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of 10. Each set has one 4 in the units place, so that's 9 times. But wait, in the 40-49 range, the units digit is 4 only once, right? So, maybe I should check that. Wait, no, actually, in the tens place, 40-49 gives 10 occurrences, and in the units place, from 10 to 99, excluding 40-49, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see: 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, but 44 has 4 in both tens and units, so we've already counted the 4 in the tens place. So, in the units place, it's 9 occurrences. So, total for two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 occurrences of 4. Now, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100-488. Hmm, this is a bit more complicated. Let's break it down into hundreds, tens, and units places. First, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Now, the digit 4 in the hundreds place only occurs in 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Next, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9, and we're looking for when it's 4. So, for each hundred, like 100-199, the tens digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 140-149, 240-249, etc. But since our book goes up to 488, we need to check if 400-488 includes a full set or not. Let's see: 400-488. The tens digit in 400-488 can be 0-8. So, when the tens digit is 4, it's 440-449. That's 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, except maybe the last one, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times. But since our hundreds go up to 400-488, which is not a full hundred, but in the tens place, 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, for the tens place, how many hundreds do we have? From 100-399, that's three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place, so 3*10=30. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10. So, total for tens place: 30 + 10 = 40. Wait, but 400-488 is part of the hundreds place, but when considering the tens place, it's separate. So, yes, 40 occurrences in the tens place across all three-digit numbers. Now, the units place in three-digit numbers. Similarly, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, the units digit is 4 once every 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? From 100-199: 104,114,...,194. That's 10 numbers. Similarly, 200-299: 204,214,...,294: 10 numbers. 300-399: 304,314,...,394: 10 numbers. And 400-488: 404,414,...,484. Wait, 400-488: the units digit 4 occurs at 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. So, in 400-488, units digit 4 occurs 9 times. So, total for units place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39. So, total for units place: 39. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4 in three-digit numbers: hundreds place 89, tens place 40, units place 39. So, 89 + 40 = 129, plus 39 is 168. So, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 168. Now, adding up all the 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1 + 19 = 20, plus 168 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Maybe a similar approach. Single-digit page numbers: 1-9. The digit 8 appears once, on page 8. So, 1 occurrence. Two-digit page numbers: 10-99. Again, break into tens and units. Tens place: 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. Units place: 8 in the units digit occurs once every 10 numbers, so from 10-99, excluding 80-89, how many times does 8 appear? Let's see: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers. But wait, 88 has 8 in both tens and units, so we've already counted the tens place. So, units place: 9 occurrences. So, total for two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 occurrences of 8. Now, three-digit page numbers: 100-488. Let's break it down. Hundreds place: 1,2,3,4. So, 8 in the hundreds place doesn't occur because the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, 0 occurrences in hundreds place. Tens place: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9. So, in each hundred, 8 occurs in the tens place for 10 numbers: 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, since 488 is the last page. So, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but only 9 numbers (480-488). So, for the tens place: From 100-399, each hundred contributes 10 occurrences, so 3*10=30. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total for tens place: 30 + 9 = 39. Units place: In each hundred, the units digit 8 occurs once every 10 numbers. So, from 100-199: 108,118,...,198: 10 numbers. Similarly, 200-299: 208,218,...,298: 10 numbers. 300-399: 308,318,...,398: 10 numbers. 400-488: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included. So, units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. So, total for units place: 39. Now, adding up all the 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place 39 + units place 39 = 78. So, total 8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) = 1 + 19 = 20, plus 78 is 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's. Single-digit: 1. Two-digit: tens place 10 (40-49), units place 9 (14,24,...,94 except 44 which is already counted in tens). So, 19. Three-digit: hundreds place 89 (400-488), tens place: 40 (from 100-399: 3 hundreds *10 each =30, plus 440-449:10, total 40), units place: from 100-399: 10 each, so 30, plus 404,414,...,484: 9, so 39. So, 89+40+39=168. Total 4's:1+19+168=188. Now, 8's: single-digit:1. Two-digit: tens 10 (80-89), units 9 (18,28,...,98 except 88), so 19. Three-digit: tens place: from 100-399:3 hundreds *10=30, plus 480-488:9, total 39. Units place: from 100-399:10 each, so 30, plus 408,418,...,488:9, total 39. So, 39+39=78. Total 8's:1+19+78=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Similarly, I'll do the same for 8's. \n\nStarting with the units place for 4's: In every set of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48 full sets and a remainder of 8. So, in each full set, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so no additional 4's here. So, units place gives 48 fours.\n\nNow, the tens place for 4's: In every set of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Let me see how many full hundreds are there in 488. There are four full hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and then 400-488. Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so we have four full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and a partial hundred from 400-488. In each full hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers (like 40-49, etc.), so that's 4 sets times 10, which is 40 fours. Now, in the partial hundred from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 more fours. So, total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNext, the hundreds place for 4's: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, contributing 89 fours.\n\nAdding up all the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 gives 187 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units: 48, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Let me see: from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in each place. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place for 8's: Similar to the 4's, in every set of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. From 1-488, that's 48 full sets (48*10=480) and 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each full set, one 8, so 48 eights. In the remaining 8 numbers, units digits are 1-8, so the 488th page is 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's an additional 1. So, total units place eights: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place for 8's: In every set of 100 numbers, the tens digit is 8 for exactly 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many full hundreds are there? Four full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399). Each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, in the partial hundred from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 more eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place for 8's: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights.\n\nWait, so fours are 187 and eights are 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me just check my counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\nFor eights:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place for fours. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? The last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, 4 + 10(n-1) = 484 => 10(n-1) = 480 => n-1=48 => n=49. Wait, so that would mean 49 fours in the units place, not 48. Did I make a mistake earlier?\n\nWait, earlier I thought units place fours were 48 because 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets. But actually, from 1-488, the last number with a units digit 4 is 484, which is the 49th occurrence because starting at 4 as the first. So, 4,14,...,484: that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, I was wrong earlier; units place fours are 49, not 48.\n\nSimilarly, for units place eights: from 1-488, the last number with units digit 8 is 488. So, how many? 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49, which matches my earlier count.\n\nSo, I must have made a mistake in the fours' units place count. So, fours' units place is 49, not 48. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, fours:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nEights:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so now I get a difference of 90. But let me check again.\n\nWait, in the tens place for fours, I had 50. Let me see: in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? From 1-488, every block of 100 has 10 fours in the tens place. So, 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). 100-199: 140-149 (10). 200-299: 240-249 (10). 300-399: 340-349 (10). Then, 400-488: 440-449 (10). So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place for fours: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nUnits place: 49 fours.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nEights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place for fours was 49, but I initially thought 48. So, perhaps the correct difference is 90. Let me confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this by calculating the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) + (if 488 mod 10 >=4, add 1). Wait, 488/10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. Then, since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so add 1. So, 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in units place: floor(488/10)=48, and 488 mod 10=8, which is equal to 8, so add 1. So, 48 +1=49.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)*10 + (if (488 mod 100) >=40, then (488 mod 100) -40 +1 else 0). So, floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. Now, 488 mod 100=88. Since 88 >=40, we add 88-40+1=49. Wait, but that can't be right because in the tens place, 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 another 10, etc. Wait, perhaps a better formula is:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in tens place from 1 to N is:\n\ncount = (N // 100) * 10\nremainder = N % 100\nif remainder >= (d * 10):\n    count += (remainder - d * 10 + 1)\nelse:\n    count += 0\n\nSo, for 4 in tens place:\n\nN=488.\n\ncount = (488 // 100)*10 = 4*10=40.\n\nremainder=488%100=88.\n\nSince 88 >=4*10=40, so count += (88 -40 +1)=49.\n\nSo, total 40 +49=89? Wait, that can't be, because in each hundred, it's 10, and we have 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40, plus in the last partial hundred, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 40+10=50. So, perhaps the formula is giving me 40 +49=89, which contradicts. Hmm, maybe I'm applying the formula wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is for any digit, but in this case, for tens place, when d=4, it's 40-49, so in each hundred, it's 10 numbers. So, from 0-99, 40-49:10; 100-199:140-149:10; 200-299:240-249:10; 300-399:340-349:10; 400-488:440-449:10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. So, the formula might not be correct as I applied it earlier.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is for when the digit is in the units place, not tens. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider each digit place separately.\n\nIn any case, I think my initial count was correct: 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the tens place:\n\nUsing the same approach, from 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? It's 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n\nEach of the first four ranges contributes 10 eights, so 4*10=40. The last range, 480-488, is 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 eights. So, total 40+9=49 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, eights in tens place:49.\n\nSo, total eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98.\n\nFours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 187-98=89, but after correcting units place fours to 49, it's 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours.\n\nUnits place fours:49.\n\nTens place fours:50.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nEights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98.\n\nSo, difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought it was 89, but now it's 90. Let me see where the mistake was.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 48 fours initially, but upon correction, it's 49. So, that adds one more four, making the total fours 188 instead of 187. So, the difference goes from 89 to 90.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the units place fours again. From 1-488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then 14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in the units place. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the units place:8,18,...,488. The number of terms is ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights.\n\nSo, now, fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nEights:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can write a small program or use another method to confirm, but since I can't do that right now, I'll have to rely on my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can count the number of fours and eights in each position again.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- Fours:49\n- Eights:49\n\nTens place:\n\n- Fours:50\n- Eights:49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- Fours:89\n- Eights:0\n\nSo, total fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal eights:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent now.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, etc. How many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each of these 48 sets, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear here? Yes, 484 has a 4 in the units place. So that's one more. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place: 40-49. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each of these 4 hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4*10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. The tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So that's another 10. So total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So that's 89 times.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4, in every set of 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. The remaining 8 numbers are 481-488. The units digits here are 1-8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. In each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times: 80-89. So, in 4 full hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 times. In the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here. So total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never is 8. So, hundreds place 8's are 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems right. For the tens place, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. Units place seems correct too. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** In every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 full sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 fours. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include one more 4 (484). Total: 49.\n- **Tens place:** In each hundred, 4 appears 10 times (40-49). With 4 full hundreds, that's 40 fours. The last partial hundred (401-488) includes another 10 fours (440-449). Total: 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48. The last 8 numbers include one more 8 (488). Total: 49.\n- **Tens place:** In each hundred, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). With 4 full hundreds, that's 40 eights. The last partial hundred (401-488) includes 9 eights (480-488). Total: 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place. Total: 0.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, for the units place. In the units digit, how often does 4 appear? Well, in every set of ten numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each ten numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers. So, in each complete set, 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again in the units place here. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. In the tens digit, how often does 4 appear? Well, in each hundred numbers, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each ten. So, for example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all ten numbers. Similarly, this happens in 140-149, 240-249, etc. So, how many such sets are there? Since the book goes up to 488, we have 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, in each hundred, except the last one, there's a block of ten where the tens digit is 4. So, from 40-49, that's 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 in the tens place. Similarly, 140-149 is another 10, and so on. Let's see, how many hundreds do we have? 400-488 is the last hundred. So, up to 399, we have four hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399. Each of these has a block where the tens digit is 4, so that's four blocks, each contributing 10 instances. So, 4 x 10 = 40. Now, in the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, does the tens digit 4 appear here? Yes, from 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's would be 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. From 0-99, the tens digit 4 is in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 100-199: 140-149, another 10. 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. Then, 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5 x 10 = 50. So, total 4's in the tens place is 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. How often does 4 appear here? The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 instances where the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's 89 more 4's.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check that. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 499, but our book ends at 488, so it's from 400 to 488. So, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, yes, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds. That would be 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. How many times does 8 appear in the page numbers from 1 to 488? Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4's, in every set of ten numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so 8 appears once every ten numbers. So, in 488 pages, how many complete sets of ten are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more in the units place (at 488). So, total units place 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. In each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 for each ten. So, 8 in the tens place occurs in the block 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 instances. Let me count:\n\nFrom 0-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times 8 in the tens place.\n\nFrom 100-199: 180-189, another 10.\n\nFrom 200-299: 280-289, another 10.\n\nFrom 300-399: 380-389, another 10.\n\nFrom 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 9 instances.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 0-99: 10, 100-199: 10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, and 400-488:9. So, 10x4=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers from 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, the hundreds place contributes 0 8's.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, that's 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total.\n\nWait, but earlier, for 4's, I had 187, and for 8's, 98. So, the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 times.\n\nTens place: 50 times.\n\nHundreds place: 89 times.\n\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 complete sets of ten, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus the last set 481-488, which includes 488, so units digit 8 appears once more. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 times, except the last one which contributes 9. So, 4 hundreds contributing 10 each, that's 40, plus 9 from the last partial hundred, so 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, since the book ends at 488, which is less than 800.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nTherefore, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for 8's again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial cycle, 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, adding one more 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributing 10, except the last one which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 4 times 10 and once 9, totaling 49. So, that's correct.\n\nAnd hundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times the hundreds digit is 4, which is correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. So, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98, so 187 - 98 = 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** In each set of 10 numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20), '4' appears once in the units place. There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488 pages, contributing 48 '4's. The last partial set (481-488) doesn't add any more '4's in the units place. Total: 48.\n   - **Tens place:** In each hundred (e.g., 0-99, 100-199), '4' appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). There are 5 such hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), contributing 10 each, except the last which contributes 10 (440-449). Total: 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, '4' appears in the hundreds place 89 times. Total: 89.\n   - **Total '4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** Similarly, '8' appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 complete sets, contributing 48 '8's. The last partial set (481-488) adds one more '8' at 488. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** In each hundred, '8' appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89). There are 4 complete hundreds contributing 10 each, and the last partial hundred (400-488) contributes 9 '8's (480-488). Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488. Total: 0.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 187\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 187 - 98 = 89\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Same with 8's. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. Similarly, 8 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). Each complete set contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for the units place, 48 sets would give 48 4's and 48 8's. Now, the extra 8 numbers (481-488) include 484, which has a 4 in the units place. So, that's one more 4. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 8's in units place: 48. \n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, in each 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, same with 8. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 4's and 40 8's. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 440-449, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, that's 10 4's. How about 8 in the tens place? From 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, actually, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, 9 8's in the tens place. \n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. 8's in tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49. \n\nNow, the hundreds place: For the hundreds digit, each digit from 1 to 4 appears 100 times each in the hundreds place for the respective hundreds. So, 1 appears 100 times (1-99, but actually 100 times from 100-199), wait, no. Wait, each hundred block has 100 numbers where the hundreds digit is fixed. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, which doesn't count. From 100-199, hundreds digit is 1, 200-299 is 2, 300-399 is 3, and 400-488 is 4. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0. \n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units place 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. Total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. \n\nNow, 8's: units place 48, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. Total 8's = 48 + 49 + 0 = 97. \n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91. \n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations. \n\nFor units place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8, so 48 each. Then, the last 8 numbers (481-488) have 484, which adds 1 more 4. So, 48 +1=49 for 4's, 48 for 8's. \n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's, so 40 each. Then, in 401-488, for 4's in tens place: 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. For 8's in tens place: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, total 4's: 40 +10=50, 8's: 40 +9=49. \n\nHundreds place: 4's appear from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. 8's don't appear in hundreds place, so 0. \n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89= 188. \n\nTotal 8's: 48 +49 +0=97. \n\nDifference: 188 -97=91. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused about the hundreds place for 8's. Since the book goes up to 488, does the hundreds digit ever reach 8? No, because 800 would be page 800, but the book only has 488 pages. So, hundreds digit can only be 1,2,3,4. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0. That's correct. \n\nAnother way to check: Maybe I can calculate the total number of digits and see if the counts make sense. But perhaps that's overcomplicating. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about how many times each digit appears in each position. \n\nWait, another approach: For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate how many times 4 appears and how many times 8 appears, then sum them up. \n\nUnits place: As before, 48 full tens, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8, plus the extra 8 numbers (481-488) contributing 1 more 4. So, 49 4's, 48 8's. \n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. 4 full hundreds (1-400) would have 4*10=40 each. Then, in 401-488, for tens place: 4's occur in 440-449 (10 times), and 8's occur in 480-488 (9 times). So, total 4's: 40 +10=50, 8's:40 +9=49. \n\nHundreds place: 4's occur in 400-488, which is 89 times. 8's: 0. \n\nSo, 4's total:49+50+89=188, 8's total:48+49+0=97. Difference:91. \n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete sets (480 numbers) and 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n   - 4's: 48 + 1 (from 484) = 49.\n   - 8's: 48.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes ten 4's and ten 8's in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 complete hundreds (400 numbers) and a partial hundred (401-488).\n   - 4's: 4*10 + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n   - 8's: 4*10 + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4's appear in 400-488, contributing 89 4's.\n   - 8's do not appear in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, it's page 4; from 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. Since the book has 488 pages, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra pages (481-488). In each complete group, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, page 484. So that's one more 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, the tens place: Similarly, for every group of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, pages 40-49 have 4 in the tens place, which is 10 times. Since the book has 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). In each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens place is 4 in the range 440-449. That's 10 pages, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 more 4's in the tens place. So total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Wait, no, that's not right. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages, so each page from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Wait, but 488 - 400 + 1 is 89, so yes, 89 times. So, total hundreds place 4's are 89.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's are 188.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus one more in the last 8 pages (484), total 49. Tens: Each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds contribute 40, plus in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 more, total 50. Hundreds: From 400-488, which is 89 pages, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. So 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, considering units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of 10, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so page 488 has an 8 in the units place. So that's one more, making total units place 8's = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For every group of 100, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in the range 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 pages. So, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? So that's 9 times. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's = 0.\n\nSo, total 8's are units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Units: 48 full groups, each with one 8, so 48, plus one more in 488, total 49. Tens: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 8's, so 40, plus in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 more, total 49. Hundreds: 0. So total 8's are 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 4's are 188, 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's. That seems right.\n\nAnd in the tens place for 4's, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 more 4's. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 more 8's. That seems correct too.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the counts are accurate. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 pages contribute one 4 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10 pages, contributing 48 fours.\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more 4 (page 484).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 pages contribute ten 4's in the tens place.\n   - Four complete hundreds contribute 40 fours.\n   - Pages 401-488 add ten 4's in the tens place (pages 440-449).\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 each have a 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 pages, so 89 fours.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 pages contribute one 8 in the units place.\n   - 48 complete groups contribute 48 eights.\n   - Page 488 adds one more 8.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 pages contribute ten 8's in the tens place.\n   - Four complete hundreds contribute 40 eights.\n   - Pages 401-488 add nine 8's in the tens place (pages 480-488).\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No pages have an 8 in the hundreds place (max page is 488).\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe it's easier to think about each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in every block of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks of 10 pages and then 8 extra pages. In each block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once more in 484. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place: Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 pages. In each block of 100, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 pages (40-49). So, how many full hundreds are there in 488 pages? That's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). In each of the 4 hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in the 440-449 range. That's another 10 pages, so 10 more 4's. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNext, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. How many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again.\n\nStarting with units place: Just like with 4's, every block of 10 pages has one 8 in the units place. There are 48 full blocks of 10 in 488 pages, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each hundred has one such block of 10 pages. So, in 488 pages, there are 4 full hundreds. Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 pages (480-488), so 9 8's in the tens place. Wait, no, actually, the tens digit being 8 in 480-489 would be from 480 to 489, but the book stops at 488, so that's 9 pages (480-488). So, 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's there.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full blocks (10 pages each) give 48 4's, plus one more in 484, so 49. Correct.\n- Tens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's (40-49, etc.), so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 4's. Correct.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full blocks, 48 8's, plus one in 488, so 49. Correct.\n- Tens place: 4 full hundreds, each with 10 8's (80-89, etc.), so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488), so 9 8's. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full blocks of 10 pages (488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8), contributing 48 \u00d7 1 = 48 fours.\n   - In the remaining 8 pages (481-488), 484 has a 4 in the units place: 1 more.\n   - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 pages, the tens digit is 4 for 10 consecutive pages (e.g., 40-49).\n   - There are 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 fours: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - In the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 440-449: 10 fours.\n   - Total in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - This is 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89), contributing 89 fours.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 pages, the digit 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - 48 full blocks contribute 48 eights.\n   - In the remaining 8 pages (481-488), 488 has an 8 in the units place: 1 more.\n   - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 pages, the tens digit is 8 for 10 consecutive pages (e.g., 80-89).\n   - 4 full hundreds contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights.\n   - In the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-488: 9 eights (since 488 is the last page).\n   - Total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14; and so on. Since the book goes up to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and a partial set of 8 pages (481-488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times for the complete sets and once more in the partial set (page 484). That gives 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten numbers. For example, 40-49 have 4 in the tens place, which is 10 times. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? The first block is 40-49, the next would be 140-149, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 pages with a 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 40-49, that's one block, then 140-149 is another, 240-249 is another, 340-349 is another, and 440-449 is the fifth block. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. \n\nWait, but does the last block go up to 449? Since the book ends at 488, yes, 440-449 is entirely within 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, for every set of ten, 8 appears once. So, how many complete sets of ten are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets and a partial set of 8 pages. Each complete set contributes one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. In the partial set (481-488), page 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me count how many such blocks are in 488 pages. The first block is 80-89, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and then 480-489. Wait, but 480-489 would go up to 489, but the book ends at 488. So, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many complete blocks are there? The first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) are complete, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place. That's 4 blocks * 10 = 40 times. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 more. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the last block was 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488, so 9 numbers. So, yes, 49 times in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times.\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me double-check. For the tens place, I had 4 complete blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each with 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Then, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 8's in units place were 49, which matches. So, 98 in total.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? For every 10 numbers, it's once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens and a partial of 8. So, 48 + 1 (for 488) = 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, as above, 49 times.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's in each place.\n\nUnits place: From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Plus, in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digit 4 is at 484, so that's one more. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks * 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct.\n\nNow, 8's: Units place is 49, tens place is 49, so total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, right? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the 8's in the tens place. The blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's five blocks. The first four are full blocks, each with 10 8's, so 4*10=40. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, 49 in the tens place for 8's, and 49 in the units place, totaling 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because I might have missed something. Let me try a different approach to verify. Maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place again, but more carefully.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place: For each ten numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, in each set of 10, 4 appears once. From 1 to 488, how many sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit is 1-8, so 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5*10=50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48. In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit is 1-8, so 488 has an 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four are full blocks, each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: As before, no 8's in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** For every 10 numbers, '4' appears once. There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 '4's. In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), '4' appears once (484). Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** '4' appears in the tens place for 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 '4's, totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, there are 89 numbers with '4' in the hundreds place. Total: 89.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to '4's, '8' appears once every 10 numbers. 48 complete sets contribute 48 '8's. In the remaining 8 numbers, '8' appears once (488). Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** '8' appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 '8's. The last block (480-488) contributes 9 '8's. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No '8's appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8' in the page numbers.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. Since the book has 488 pages, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra pages. In each complete block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, the extra 8 pages (from 481 to 488) will have page 484, which is another 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Here, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers. For example, from 40-49, each page number has a 4 in the tens place. Similarly, from 140-149, 240-249, etc. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see: 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds. Each hundred will have one block of 10 where the tens digit is 4. So, 4 blocks \u00d7 10 pages each = 40 times. But wait, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449. That's another 10 pages, so 10 more times. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but wait, 400-488 is the last hundred, and 440-449 is within that. So, yes, that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 pages. So, that's 89 more 4's. \n\nAdding them up: Units (49) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, every block of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, 48 complete blocks (480 pages) give 48 eights. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) include page 488, which is another 8 in the units place. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes 10 eights. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see: 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds. Each hundred has one block of 10 where the tens digit is 8, so that's 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (400-488), does the tens digit 8 appear? Yes, from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 pages (480-488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. Therefore, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no pages where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding them up: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 4.\n   - 488 / 10 = 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1, totaling 48.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) include page 484, adding 1 more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers have a block of 10 where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49).\n   - 488 / 100 = 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10, totaling 40.\n   - The last partial hundred (400-488) includes 440-449, adding 10.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, 48 complete blocks contribute 48.\n   - The last 8 pages include page 488, adding 1.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers have a block of 10 where the tens digit is 8 (e.g., 80-89).\n   - 4 complete hundreds contribute 40.\n   - The last partial hundred includes 480-488, contributing 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Similarly, I'll do the same for 8's. \n\nFirst, for the digit 4:\n\n1. Units place: This is the ones digit in a number. So, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks of 10, and then 8 extra numbers. Each full block contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total units place 4's: 48.\n\n2. Tens place: This is the second digit from the right. In every block of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each such block contributes 10 4's. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 1-100, 101-200, ..., 401-488. Wait, 488 is less than 500, so the last block is 401-488. Let's see how many full hundreds there are. From 1-400, that's four blocks of 100 each. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, in the last block, 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 1 for 410-419, ..., 8 for 480-488. So, does 4 appear in the tens place here? Yes, in 440-449, the tens digit is 4. So that's 10 more 4's. So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. Hundreds place: This is the first digit from the right. In the range 1-488, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but I think I might be making a mistake here. Let me check: 400 is the first number with hundreds digit 4, and 488 is the last. So, the count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for 8's.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to 4's, in every block of 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many full blocks of 10 are there? 48 full blocks (since 488/10=48.8). Each contributes one 8, so 48. Now, the last partial block is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. The units digits here are 1-8, so 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: In every block of 100 numbers, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, how many full hundreds? From 1-400, that's four blocks. Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, in the last block, 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all numbers from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 8's in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought it's 10, but since it's only up to 488, it's 9. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's here.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nWait, that seems off because I thought 4's were 187 and 8's are 98, so the difference would be 187-98=89. But let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nWait, for the 4's in the hundreds place, I counted 89, but actually, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so that's correct.\n\nFor the 8's in the tens place, I had 40 from the first four hundreds (1-400), and then in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more, making it 49. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again for 8's. From 1-488, each block of 10 has one 8, so 48 blocks give 48, and then in 481-488, the units digit is 8 at 488, so that's one more, totaling 49. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 187, total 8's: 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Maybe I should recount each digit place again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48+50=98, 98+89=187\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49+49=98\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full decades (1-480) contributing 48 occurrences. The last 8 numbers (481-488) don't add any, so total 48.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers (e.g., 40-49). There are 4 full centuries (1-400) contributing 40 occurrences. The last 88 numbers (401-488) include another 10 occurrences in 440-449, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. 48 full decades contribute 48, plus one more in 488, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. 4 full centuries contribute 40, and in 480-488, there are 9 occurrences, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra numbers. Each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Plus, in the last partial set (481-488), does the units digit 4 appear? Let me check: 484 is within that range, so that's another 4. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, in every set of a hundred numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly ten times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). How many such sets are there up to 488? Well, 488 is less than 500, so there are four complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these contributes ten 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), how many 4's are in the tens place? The numbers 440-449 would have 4's in the tens place, but wait, 401-488 includes 440-449, which is ten numbers, so that's another ten 4's. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that?

So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: In every set of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of ten, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit 8 appears in 488, so that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: In every set of a hundred numbers, the digit 8 appears exactly ten times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, up to 488, how many complete hundreds? Four complete sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes ten 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is nine numbers. Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but 488 is the last page. So, from 480 to 488, that's nine numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, that's nine more 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place.

So, for each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the units digit 4 appears once. There are 9 such groups, so 9 fours. But wait, from 10-99, that's 90 numbers, so 9 groups of 10. So, 9 fours in the units place. So, for two-digit numbers, total fours are 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 fours. Now, moving on to three-digit numbers (100-488). This is a bit more complicated. Let's break it down by each digit place: hundreds, tens, and units. First, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Now, when the hundreds digit is 4, the numbers are from 400-488. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in all these numbers, which is 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Next, the tens place. For three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be from 0-9. We need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers up to 488. Let's think about it. For each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 100 numbers. So, in each hundreds group, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). Now, how many hundreds groups do we have? Up to 488, so 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. For the first three groups (100-399), each has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 3 groups \u00d7 10 = 30 fours. Now, for the 400-488 group, the tens digit can go up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 fours. So, total fours in the tens place for three-digit numbers are 30 + 10 = 40 fours. Now, the units place. Similarly, for each hundreds group, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundreds group, the units digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. Let's calculate this. For 100-199: there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the units place (104, 114, ..., 194). Similarly, for 200-299: 204, 214, ..., 294 \u2192 10 fours. Same for 300-399: 10 fours. Now, for 400-488: the units digit 4 appears in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488. Wait, let me check: from 400-488, how many times does the units digit 4 occur? It's every 10 numbers starting at 404, so 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, right? Because 400 + 4 = 404, then adding 10 each time up to 484. So, 9 fours in the units place for 400-488. So, total fours in the units place for three-digit numbers are 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 fours. Now, adding up all the fours from each digit place in three-digit numbers: hundreds place 89 + tens place 40 + units place 39 = 89 + 40 = 129 + 39 = 168 fours. Now, let's add the fours from two-digit and single-digit numbers. Single-digit: 1, two-digit: 19, three-digit: 168. So total fours = 1 + 19 + 168 = 188 fours. Now, let me check if I did that correctly. Wait, 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) = 20, plus 168 (three-digit) = 188. Hmm, that seems high. Let me double-check the three-digit counts. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Tens place: 3 groups (100-399) each with 10 fours, that's 30, plus 400-488 having 10 fours in the tens place, so 40 total. Units place: 3 groups with 10 each, so 30, plus 9 in 400-488, so 39. So, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. That seems correct. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I think the approach will be similar. Let's start with single-digit page numbers: 8 is on page 8, so that's 1 eight. For two-digit numbers (10-99), let's consider tens and units places. Tens place: numbers where the tens digit is 8, which are 80-89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 eights. Units place: in each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the units digit 8 appears once. There are 9 such groups (10-99), so 9 eights. So, for two-digit numbers, total eights are 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 eights. Now, for three-digit numbers (100-488), again, hundreds, tens, and units places. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because we're only going up to 488. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Tens place: For each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers each. So, for 100-199: 180-189, 10 numbers. Similarly, 200-299: 280-289, 10 numbers. 300-399: 380-389, 10 numbers. Now, 400-488: the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, for 400-488, it's 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 3 groups \u00d7 10 = 30, plus 9 in 400-488, so 39 eights. Now, units place: For each hundreds group, the units digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, for 100-199: 108, 118, ..., 198 \u2192 10 eights. Similarly, 200-299: 208, 218, ..., 298 \u2192 10 eights. 300-399: 308, 318, ..., 398 \u2192 10 eights. Now, 400-488: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included, but 498 would be beyond. So, 9 eights in the units place for 400-488. So, total eights in the units place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 eights. Now, adding up all eights from each digit place in three-digit numbers: tens place 39 + units place 39 = 78 eights. Now, adding the eights from two-digit and single-digit numbers: single-digit: 1, two-digit: 19, three-digit: 78. So, total eights = 1 + 19 + 78 = 98 eights. Wait, that seems lower than I expected. Let me check again. Single-digit: 1 eight. Two-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. Three-digit: tens place 39, units place 39, so 78. So, total eights: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98. Hmm, okay. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours: 188, total eights: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours and eights. For fours: single-digit: 1, two-digit: 19, three-digit: 168. Total: 188. For eights: single-digit: 1, two-digit: 19, three-digit: 78. Total: 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because I might have miscounted somewhere. Let me double-check the three-digit counts for fours and eights.\n\nFor fours in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n- Tens place: 100-399: 3 groups \u00d7 10 = 30 fours. 400-488: 10 fours (440-449). So, 40 fours.\n- Units place: 100-399: 3 groups \u00d7 10 = 30 fours. 400-488: 9 fours (404, 414, ..., 484). So, 39 fours.\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 fours in three-digit numbers. Plus single and two-digit: 1 + 19 = 20. So, 168 + 20 = 188 fours.\n\nFor eights in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n- Tens place: 100-399: 3 groups \u00d7 10 = 30 eights. 400-488: 9 eights (480-488). So, 39 eights.\n- Units place: 100-399: 3 groups \u00d7 10 = 30 eights. 400-488: 9 eights (408, 418, ..., 488). So, 39 eights.\nTotal: 39 + 39 = 78 eights in three-digit numbers. Plus single and two-digit: 1 + 19 = 20. So, 78 + 20 = 98 eights.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** The digit 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: Pages 40-49 \u2192 10 fours.\n     - Units place: Pages 14, 24, ..., 94 \u2192 9 fours.\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19 fours.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: Pages 400-488 \u2192 89 fours.\n     - Tens place: \n       - 100-399: 3 groups (140-149, 240-249, 340-349) \u2192 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 fours.\n       - 400-488: Pages 440-449 \u2192 10 fours.\n       - Total: 30 + 10 = 40 fours.\n     - Units place:\n       - 100-399: 3 groups (104, 114, ..., 194; 204, ..., 294; 304, ..., 394) \u2192 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 fours.\n       - 400-488: Pages 404, 414, ..., 484 \u2192 9 fours.\n       - Total: 30 + 9 = 39 fours.\n     - Total for three-digit pages: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168 fours.\n   - **Total fours:** 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188 fours.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** The digit 8 appears once (page 8).\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: Pages 80-89 \u2192 10 eights.\n     - Units place: Pages 18, 28, ..., 98 \u2192 9 eights.\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19 eights.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: 0 eights (since pages go up to 488).\n     - Tens place:\n       - 100-399: 3 groups (180-189, 280-289, 380-389) \u2192 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 eights.\n       - 400-488: Pages 480-488 \u2192 9 eights.\n       - Total: 30 + 9 = 39 eights.\n     - Units place:\n       - 100-399: 3 groups (108, 118, ..., 198; 208, ..., 298; 308, ..., 398) \u2192 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 eights.\n       - 400-488: Pages 408, 418, ..., 488 \u2192 9 eights.\n       - Total: 30 + 9 = 39 eights.\n     - Total for three-digit pages: 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78 eights.\n   - **Total eights:** 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98 eights.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of fours: 188\n   - Number of eights: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 more times than the digit 8.  \n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Same with 8's. \n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. Units place: In every set of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, how many tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of ten, and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, in each of the 48 sets, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), does 484 fall into that? Yes, 484 is within 481-488, so that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Similarly, in the tens place, 4 appears in a block of ten numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block contributes ten 4's in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1 to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for numbers 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), or 4 (400-488). So, for each hundred, there's a block where the tens digit is 4. Let's see:\n\n- 0-99: 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place.\n- 100-199: 140-149: another 10.\n- 200-299: 240-249: another 10.\n- 300-399: 340-349: another 10.\n- 400-488: 440-449: another 10.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10 = 50. But wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is correct, so 50 seems right. Hmm, but wait, 488 is less than 500, so does that affect anything? No, because 440-449 is entirely within 400-488. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, is that correct? Because each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so yes, that's 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400 is included, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's.\n\nAgain, considering units, tens, and hundreds place.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to 4's, in every set of ten numbers, the units digit is 8 once. So, from 1 to 488, how many such sets? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets and 8 extra numbers (481-488). Each set contributes one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Now, in the last partial set (481-488), does 488 fall into that? Yes, so that's one more 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: For the tens digit being 8, it occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, but only up to 488. So, each block contributes ten 8's in the tens place, except maybe the last one.\n\nLet's count:\n\n- 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place.\n- 100-199: 180-189: another 10.\n- 200-299: 280-289: another 10.\n- 300-399: 380-389: another 10.\n- 400-488: 480-488: here, the tens digit is 8, but how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, in the tens place, each of these has an 8, so that's 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. For the last block, 480-488, does that give 9 8's in the tens place? Because 480 has an 8 in the tens place, 481 has it, up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, yes, 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nNow, total 4's are 188 and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's there. Then, in the tens place, 5 blocks each giving 10, so 50. Units place, 49. So, 89 + 50 + 49 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's, units place 49, tens place 49, so 98 total. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed any 8's in the hundreds place. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can't be 8, so no 8's there. So, that's correct.\n\nI think that's the right approach. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits '4' and '8' in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** In every block of 10 numbers, '4' appears once. There are 48 complete blocks (1-480) and one partial block (481-488), giving 48 + 1 = 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** '4' appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks (including 440-449), each contributing 10 '4's, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, each number has a '4' in the hundreds place, totaling 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to '4's, '8' appears once per block of 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The last block is 480-488, contributing 9 occurrences. Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No '8's since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in the range 1-10, the units digit is 4 once (page 4). Similarly, in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. Since the book goes up to 488, let's see how many complete sets of 10 there are. From 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10. So, in each set, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, from 481-488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 doesn't appear here. So, units place gives us 48 fours.\n\nNext, the tens place: The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-488 is also there. Let me check each range. \n\nFrom 40-49: That's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 10 fours. \n\nSimilarly, from 140-149: Another 10 fours in the tens place. \n\n240-249: Another 10 fours. \n\n340-349: Another 10 fours. \n\n440-449: Another 10 fours. \n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nSo, adding up the fours from each place: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. I need to count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places from 1 to 488.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the fours, for every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10, giving 48 eights. Then, from 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so that's another 8 in page 488. So, units place gives 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\nNext, the tens place: The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let me check each range.\n\n80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights in the tens place.\n\n180-189: Another 10 eights.\n\n280-289: Another 10 eights.\n\n380-389: Another 10 eights.\n\n480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8, but how many numbers are there? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 in all these, so 9 eights.\n\nSo, adding up the tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights.\n\nWait, so fours total 187, eights total 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFor fours:\n\nUnits: 48. Correct, since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 in units.\n\nTens: 5 ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nHundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems right.\n\nFor eights:\n\nUnits: 48 from 1-480, plus 1 in 488, so 49. Correct.\n\nTens: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds: None, since 800 is beyond 488. So, 0. Correct.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89. So, 89 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488. \n\n1. **Counting Fours:**\n   - **Units place:** For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. From 1 to 480, there are 48 such sets, contributing 48 fours.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, each contributing 10 fours, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400 to 488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 fours.\n   - **Total fours:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting Eights:**\n   - **Units place:** For every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. From 1 to 480, 48 sets contribute 48 eights. Page 488 adds one more, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No eights, as the book doesn't reach 800.\n   - **Total eights:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 187 fours - 98 eights = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Maybe I can break it down by the number of digits.\n\nFirst, single-digit page numbers: 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears once, on page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence. Now, two-digit numbers: 10 to 99. I can think of each two-digit number as having a tens place and a ones place. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the ones place. For the tens place: numbers from 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place. For the ones place: in every set of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the ones place. Since there are 9 sets of ten in two-digit numbers (10-99), that's 9 times. Wait, no, actually, from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of ten. So, 9 times 4 appears in the ones place. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 19. Now, three-digit numbers: 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex. Let's break it down by hundreds, tens, and ones places. First, hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. Let's consider each case.\n\n- Hundreds digit = 1: 100-199. How many 4's are there in the hundreds place? None, because the hundreds digit is 1. So, 0.\n- Hundreds digit = 2: 200-299. Similarly, hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's here. 0.\n- Hundreds digit = 3: 300-399. Again, hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's. 0.\n- Hundreds digit = 4: 400-488. Here, the hundreds digit is 4. So, every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's consider the tens place in three-digit numbers. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). How many hundreds do we have? From 100-488, so 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, 400-488 is only part of the 400s. So, for hundreds 1, 2, 3, each has a full set of tens, but 400-488 is only up to 488, so the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, but let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to separate the 400-488 part. Let me think.\n\nFirst, let's consider hundreds 1, 2, 3: 100-399. Each of these hundreds has 100 numbers. In each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times. Since there are 3 hundreds, that's 3 * 10 = 30 times. Now, for the hundreds 400-488: Let's see, the tens digit here can be 0 to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 400-488, the tens digit is 0 in 400-409, 1 in 410-419, ..., up to 8 in 480-488. So, the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 times. Therefore, total 4's in the tens place in three-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 40.\n\nNow, the ones place in three-digit numbers. Similarly, for each hundred, the ones digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears once in the ones place for each set of ten. So, for each hundred, 10 occurrences. Let's check:\n\n- 100-199: 104, 114, ..., 194. That's 10 numbers.\n- 200-299: 204, 214, ..., 294. 10 numbers.\n- 300-399: 304, 314, ..., 394. 10 numbers.\n- 400-488: Now, 400-488 is 89 numbers. The ones digit cycles 0-9 every 10, so how many complete cycles are there? 89 / 10 = 8 full cycles (80 numbers) and 9 remaining. In each full cycle, the ones digit 4 appears once. So, 8 times. Then, in the remaining 9 numbers (480-488), the ones digit goes from 0 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484). So, total in 400-488: 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in the ones place in three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: hundreds (89) + tens (40) + ones (39) = 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the three-digit numbers. Let me recount the three-digit 4's.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in hundreds place.\n\nTens place: In 100-399, each hundred has 10 4's in the tens place, so 3*10=30. In 400-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 30+10=40.\n\nOnes place: In 100-399, each hundred has 10 4's in the ones place, so 3*10=30. In 400-488, the ones digit 4 appears in 404, 414, ..., 484. Let's see, how many times? From 400-488, every 10 numbers, so 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 488 is the last, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond. So, 9 times. So, 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nAdding single and two-digit: 1 + 19 = 20. So, total 4's: 20 + 168 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I think I should do the same process.\n\nSingle-digit: 1 to 9. Only page 8 has an 8. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: 10 to 99.\n\nTens place: Numbers from 80-89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nOnes place: In every set of ten, the ones digit 8 appears once. There are 9 sets of ten (10-99), so 9 times.\n\nTotal 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nThree-digit numbers: 100 to 488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the hundreds digit is 8, but since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3, 4. So, no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears in 10 numbers. Let's see:\n\n- 100-199: 180-189, which is 10 numbers.\n- 200-299: 280-289, 10 numbers.\n- 300-399: 380-389, 10 numbers.\n- 400-488: Now, the tens digit 8 would be in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10, because 488 is the last page. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nOnes place: Similarly, in each hundred, the ones digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, for 100-199: 108, 118, ..., 198. That's 10 numbers. Similarly for 200-299: 208, 218, ..., 298. 10 numbers. 300-399: 308, 318, ..., 398. 10 numbers. 400-488: Now, 400-488. The ones digit 8 appears in 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total 8's in the ones place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nTherefore, total 8's in three-digit numbers: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (ones) = 78.\n\nAdding single and two-digit 8's: 1 + 19 = 20. So, total 8's: 20 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. Single-digit: 1. Two-digit: 19. Three-digit: 78. Total 8's: 1+19=20, plus 78 is 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's: 188. Total 8's: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: tens (10) + ones (9) = 19\n- Three-digit: hundreds (89) + tens (40) + ones (39) = 168\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: tens (10) + ones (9) = 19\n- Three-digit: tens (39) + ones (39) = 78\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, 90 more 4's than 8's. That seems correct based on the counting. I don't see any mistakes in the breakdown. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe it's easier to count the occurrences of 4 in each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, 4 appears once every 10 numbers. Now, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each complete group of 10, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 times 1 is 48. Then, in the extra 8 numbers, 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. In the tens place, 4 appears in a block of 10 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see, the first block is 40-49, then the next would be 140-149, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 488 is less than 450, so the last block would be 440-449. So, how many blocks is that? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks times 10 is 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in each of these, the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units: 48, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Let me think if I missed anything. For the units place, 48 times, yes. For the tens, 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10, so 50. For the hundreds, 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll use the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place. As before, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups of 10, and 8 extra numbers. In each group of 10, 8 appears once in the units place, so 48 times. In the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once here as well (page 488). So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me count how many such blocks there are. The first block is 80-89, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the first four blocks are complete, each contributing 10 8's, and the last block contributes 9 8's. So, 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 9, so 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me confirm: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check again. Units: 49, tens: 49, so 98 total 8's. Hmm.\n\nWait, earlier I thought the units place had 49 8's because in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 8 appears once. So, 48 complete groups (48 8's) plus 1 more in the last partial group, making 49. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 5 blocks, but the last block is only 9 numbers, so 4*10 + 9 = 49. That seems correct too.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the 8's in the tens place were 49, and units were 49, so total 98. Now, the 4's were 187, so the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89. That seems like a lot, but let me see if I did everything right.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, correct? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, I had 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5*10 = 50. That's correct.\n\nIn the units place, 48 times, correct because 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and the last 8 numbers don't have a 4 in the units place. So, 48.\n\nSo, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's: units place, 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus the last 8 numbers (481-488) have one 8 in the units place (page 488). So, 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place: 5 blocks, each contributing 10 8's except the last one, which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 +49=98.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 -98=89.\n\nWait, but let me check again because 89 seems quite a large number. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this differently, perhaps using a formula or a more systematic way.\n\nAnother approach is to consider each digit place separately and calculate the number of times each digit appears.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: For each group of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, total groups = floor(488 /10)=48. So, 48 times, plus any extra in the last partial group. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, and 8 >=4, does that mean we have an extra 4? Wait, no, because in the units place, we're looking for exactly 4. So, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once here (page 484). Wait, did I miss that earlier? I thought in the units place, the last partial group didn't have a 4, but actually, 484 is within 481-488, so units digit 4 appears once more. So, units place 4's would be 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 48, but now I'm seeing that in the last partial group, 481-488, 484 is included, so units digit 4 appears once more. So, units place 4's: 49.\n\nWait, that changes things. So, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate.\n\nUnits place for 4's: floor(488 /10)=48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, check the last partial group: 481-488. The units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once here. So, total units place 4's: 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: floor(488 /10)=48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the last partial group: 481-488, units digits 1-8, so 8 appears once here. So, units place 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought 4's in units place were 48, but now I see it's 49. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, units place:\n\n4's: 49\n\n8's: 49\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's: Let's see how many times 4 appears in the tens place. It's every 100 numbers, 10 times. So, from 40-49: 10 times, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 440-449 is within 488, so yes, 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50.\n\nBut wait, does 440-449 end at 449, which is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-489: but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 4 full blocks of 10, and one partial block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nSo, tens place:\n\n4's:50\n\n8's:49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\n8's: From 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n\n4's:89\n\n8's:0\n\nNow, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, so earlier I had 187-98=89, but now I'm getting 188-98=90. I must have made a mistake in the initial count of units place for 4's. Let me verify again.\n\nWhen counting units place for 4's, from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units digit?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial group, which is 481-488, the units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once here (page 484). So, total units place 4's:48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: same logic, 48 full groups, 48, plus one in the last partial group (page 488), so 49.\n\nSo, units place: 4's=49, 8's=49.\n\nTens place:\n\n4's: 5 blocks (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449), each contributing 10, so 5*10=50.\n\n8's: 4 full blocks (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389), each contributing 10, and one partial block 480-488, contributing 9. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\n8's: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so the correct answer should be 90. I think I initially missed the extra 4 in the units place in the last partial group, leading to an incorrect count of 48 instead of 49. So, the correct difference is 90.\n\nLet me just cross-verify with another approach. Maybe using the formula for digit counting.\n\nFor a digit d in position p (units=1, tens=10, hundreds=100), the number of times d appears can be calculated as:\n\nhigher = number formed by digits higher than p\ncurrent = digit at p\nlower = number formed by digits lower than p\n\ncount = higher * 10^(p-1) + (if current > d, add 10^(p-1)) + (if current == d, add lower +1)\n\nBut maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, for each digit place, calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write out the counts for each digit place more carefully.\n\nBut I think the way I did it before, breaking it down into units, tens, hundreds, and counting each occurrence, is accurate now that I've corrected the units place for 4's.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should separate the counting based on the number of digits in the page numbers. So, first, single-digit pages (1-9). In this range, the digit 4 appears once, on page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence. Next, two-digit pages (10-99). Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I should count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. For the tens place, the numbers would be 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. For the units place, in every block of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. Since there are 9 such blocks (10-19 up to 90-99), that's 9 occurrences. So, total 4's in two-digit pages would be 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. Now, for three-digit pages (100-488). This is a bit more complicated. Let's break it down into hundreds, tens, and units places. First, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, pages 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Let's consider each hundred block separately. \n\n1. Hundreds place: For the hundreds digit being 4, which is pages 400-488. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times (from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages). But wait, actually, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, for the tens digit. In each hundred block, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, for each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), I need to find how many times 4 appears in the tens place. \n\nLet's go through each hundred block:\n\n- 100-199: The tens digit is 4 for pages 140-149. That's 10 pages, so 10 occurrences.\n- 200-299: Similarly, 240-249: 10 occurrences.\n- 300-399: 340-349: 10 occurrences.\n- 400-488: Here, the tens digit 4 would be from 440-449. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 occurrences.\n\nSo, total in the tens place across all hundreds: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40.\n\n3. Units place: Similarly, for the units digit, in each hundred block, the digit 4 appears once every ten numbers. So, for each hundred block, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? \n\nIn each hundred block, the units digit cycles from 0-9 for each ten. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times (once in each ten). Since there are four hundred blocks (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), that's 10 occurrences per hundred, but wait, the last hundred block is only up to 488, so does that affect the units place? Let me think. From 400-488, the units digit cycles through 0-9 for each ten, so even though it stops at 488, the units digit 4 would still occur in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, that's 9 times? Wait, no, because from 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten, so in each ten, units digit 4 occurs once. From 400-488, how many tens are there? Let's see: 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. So, that's 9 full tens (400-409 up to 470-479) and then 480-488 is the last partial ten. In each full ten, the units digit 4 occurs once, so 9 times, and in the last partial ten (480-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included, so that's one more occurrence. So, total in the units place for 400-488 is 10 occurrences. Therefore, each hundred block contributes 10 occurrences in the units place, so total units place 4's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought in 400-488, units digit 4 occurs 9 times, but now I'm seeing it's 10 times because 484 is included. So, yes, 10 times. So, total units place 4's: 40.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit pages: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (40) = 89 + 40 + 40 = 169.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Wait, in the hundreds place, for 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers, so 89 occurrences. Then, in the tens place, as calculated, 40 occurrences. Similarly, units place, 40 occurrences. So, 89 + 40 + 40 = 169. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 169\nTotal 4's = 1 + 19 + 169 = 189.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the three-digit count.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 4's. Then, in the tens place, for each hundred block, 10 4's, so 4 blocks: 40. Similarly, units place: 10 per hundred, 4 blocks: 40. So, 89 + 40 + 40 = 169 in three-digit. Plus single and two-digit: 1 + 19 = 20. So, total 169 + 20 = 189. Hmm, maybe that's correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. Maybe I should do the same approach.\n\nStarting with single-digit pages (1-9): The digit 8 appears once, on page 8. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit pages (10-99):\n\n- Tens place: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n- Units place: For each ten block (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), the digit 8 appears once in the units place. There are 9 such blocks, so 9 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's in two-digit pages: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nThree-digit pages (100-488):\n\nLet's break it down into hundreds, tens, and units.\n\n1. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\n2. Tens place: For each hundred block, the tens digit is 8 for a range of 10 pages. So, let's go through each hundred block:\n\n- 100-199: 180-189: 10 occurrences.\n- 200-299: 280-289: 10 occurrences.\n- 300-399: 380-389: 10 occurrences.\n- 400-488: 480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8, so pages 480-488. That's 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\n3. Units place: For each hundred block, the units digit is 8 once every ten pages. So, in each hundred block, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\n- 100-199: 108,118,...,198: 10 occurrences.\n- 200-299: 208,218,...,298: 10 occurrences.\n- 300-399: 308,318,...,398: 10 occurrences.\n- 400-488: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488: That's 9 occurrences because 488 is included, so from 408 up by 10 each time until 488, which is the 9th occurrence.\n\nSo, units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nTherefore, total 8's in three-digit pages: tens place (39) + units place (39) = 78.\n\nNow, summing up all the 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal 8's = 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's: 189, total 8's: 98. So, the difference is 189 - 98 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nLet me verify the 4's count again:\n\n- Single-digit: 1 (page 4)\n- Two-digit: tens place (40-49: 10) + units place (14,24,...,94: 9) = 19\n- Three-digit: hundreds place (400-488: 89) + tens place (140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449: 10 each, so 40) + units place (104,114,...,484: 10 per hundred, 4 hundreds, so 40). Total: 89 + 40 + 40 = 169. Then, 1 + 19 + 169 = 189. That seems correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1 (page 8)\n- Two-digit: tens place (80-89:10) + units place (18,28,...,98:9) = 19\n- Three-digit: tens place (180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488:10+10+10+9=39) + units place (108,118,...,488:10+10+10+9=39) = 78. Total 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 189 - 98 = 91. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the three-digit units place for 4's. Let me check that again. For three-digit numbers, in the units place, each hundred block from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs once every ten numbers. So, in each hundred block, that's 10 occurrences. So, 4 blocks, 10 each: 40. But wait, in 400-488, does the units digit 4 occur 10 times? Let's see: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 times because 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, making it 9, not 10. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 10. Hmm, maybe I was wrong there.\n\nWait, 400-488: the units digit 4 occurs at 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 times, not 10. So, in the units place for 400-488, it's 9, not 10. Therefore, the units place for three-digit numbers would be:\n\n- 100-199: 10\n- 200-299: 10\n- 300-399: 10\n- 400-488: 9\nTotal units place 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for three-digit numbers, for 400-488, the tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. So, the tens place is 10 each for the first three hundreds and 10 for the last. So, 40 total.\n\nWait, but the hundreds place is 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, correcting the units place: 39 instead of 40. So, total three-digit 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n\nThen, total 4's: single-digit 1 + two-digit 19 + three-digit 168 = 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, let's check the units place in 400-488. The units digit 8 occurs at 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 occurrences, not 10. So, units place in three-digit 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39, as I had before. So, total 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier by counting the units place in 400-488 as 10 instead of 9. So, the correct total 4's are 188, and 8's are 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the units place in 400-488 for 4's. The numbers would be 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. So, units place 4's in three-digit: 39, as I corrected.\n\nSo, 4's total: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n8's total: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 488 is included, so 484 is included, making it 9. So, yes, 9 occurrences in units place for 4's in 400-488.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I should use a formula or a different approach to verify.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units digit?\n\nIn every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, total groups of 10: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), which include 484, so that's 1 more. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier count. Hmm, maybe this approach is better.\n\nWait, let me think: The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete decades are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 complete decades, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 in the units place, so 48. Then, in the incomplete decade (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 484 is included, which is one more. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place: In each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49 in 100-199). So, how many hundreds are there? From 1-488, the hundreds are 1,2,3,4. So, 4 hundreds. But the last hundred is only up to 488, which is less than 500, so does that affect the tens place? Let's see: In each hundred, the tens digit 4 occurs exactly 10 times, regardless of the hundreds. So, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40 occurrences.\n\nWait, but in the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 10 occurrences. So, tens place 4's: 40.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 + 89 = 178.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier count of 188. Hmm, so which one is correct?\n\nWait, using this method, units place 4's: 49, tens:40, hundreds:89. Total: 178.\n\nBut earlier, I had 188. There's a discrepancy here. Let me figure out where I went wrong.\n\nWait, in the first approach, I broke it down into single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit, and got 188. Now, using the per-position approach, I get 178. So, I must have overcounted in the first approach.\n\nLet me check the per-position approach again.\n\nUnits place: 488 / 10 = 48 full decades, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial decade (481-488), the units digit 4 occurs once (484). So, total units place 4's: 49.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times. There are 4 hundreds (1-400, 401-800, etc.), but wait, up to 488, so the hundreds are 1,2,3,4. So, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40.\n\nHundreds place: Only in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 40 + 89 = 178.\n\nBut in the first approach, I had 188. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, in the first approach, I considered single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit separately. Let me check that again.\n\nSingle-digit 4's: 1 (page 4).\n\nTwo-digit 4's: tens place (40-49:10) + units place (14,24,...,94:9) = 19.\n\nThree-digit 4's: hundreds place (400-488:89) + tens place (140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449:10 each, so 40) + units place (104,114,...,484:10 per hundred, 4 hundreds, so 40). So, 89 + 40 + 40 = 169.\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 169 = 189.\n\nWait, but according to the per-position approach, it's 178. There's a discrepancy of 11. Hmm, maybe I overcounted in the units place for three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, in the three-digit units place, using the per-position approach, it's 49, but in the first approach, I counted 40 in three-digit units place. Wait, no, in the first approach, I had 40 in three-digit units place, but according to the per-position approach, it's 49. So, perhaps the first approach undercounted the units place.\n\nWait, in the first approach, for three-digit units place, I had 10 per hundred, 4 hundreds, so 40. But according to the per-position approach, it's 49. So, the difference is 9, which is exactly the number of units place 4's in the last partial hundred (400-488). So, in the first approach, I considered each hundred as contributing 10 units place 4's, but in reality, the last hundred (400-488) only contributes 9, not 10. So, in the first approach, I should have adjusted for that.\n\nWait, so in the first approach, I had:\n\n- Three-digit units place 4's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40. But actually, 400-488 only contributes 9, so it should be 10 +10 +10 +9 = 39. Therefore, three-digit units place 4's: 39.\n\nSo, three-digit 4's: hundreds (89) + tens (40) + units (39) = 168.\n\nThen, total 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 188.\n\nBut according to the per-position approach, it's 178. So, where is the discrepancy?\n\nWait, in the per-position approach, units place 4's are 49, which includes all the units digits from 1-488. So, that's correct.\n\nBut in the first approach, I had 39 in three-digit units place and 10 in single-digit and two-digit units place. Wait, single-digit and two-digit units place 4's: single-digit is 1 (page 4), two-digit units place is 9 (14,24,...,94). So, total units place 4's in single and two-digit: 1 + 9 = 10. Then, three-digit units place 4's: 39. So, total units place 4's: 10 + 39 = 49, which matches the per-position approach.\n\nSo, in the first approach, the three-digit units place 4's are 39, and single and two-digit units place 4's are 10, totaling 49. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the first approach, the tens place 4's: two-digit tens place (10) + three-digit tens place (40) = 50. But in the per-position approach, tens place 4's are 40. Wait, that's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, in the per-position approach, tens place 4's are 40, but in the first approach, it's 10 (two-digit) + 40 (three-digit) = 50. So, that's an overcount by 10.\n\nWait, no, in the per-position approach, tens place 4's are 40, which includes both two-digit and three-digit. So, in the first approach, I separated two-digit and three-digit, so two-digit tens place 4's are 10, and three-digit tens place 4's are 40, so total 50. But according to the per-position approach, it's 40. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, no, in the per-position approach, the tens place 4's are calculated as 40 because in each hundred, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times, and there are 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40. But in the first approach, I had two-digit tens place 4's as 10 and three-digit tens place 4's as 40, totaling 50. So, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the per-position approach. Let me think again.\n\nIn the per-position approach, for tens place 4's:\n\n- Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 10 per hundred.\n\nFrom 1-488, there are 4 hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. Wait, no, actually, 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds are 1,2,3,4, but the last hundred is only up to 488. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times, so 4 hundreds, 10 each: 40. So, that's correct.\n\nBut in the first approach, I had two-digit tens place 4's as 10 (40-49) and three-digit tens place 4's as 40 (140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449), which is 10 + 40 = 50. But according to the per-position approach, it's 40. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, no, because in the two-digit numbers, the tens place 4's are 10 (40-49), and in the three-digit numbers, the tens place 4's are 30: because in each hundred (100-199,200-299,300-399), the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times each, so 3 hundreds *10=30, plus in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (440-449). So, total tens place 4's in three-digit: 30 +10=40. So, total tens place 4's: two-digit 10 + three-digit 40 =50. But according to the per-position approach, it's 40. So, this suggests a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps the per-position approach is wrong. Let me check:\n\nIn the per-position approach, I considered that in each hundred, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times, so 4 hundreds, 10 each: 40. But in reality, in the three-digit numbers, the tens digit 4 occurs in 140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449, which is 4 sets of 10, so 40. Plus, in two-digit numbers, 40-49:10. So, total 50. So, the per-position approach must have an error.\n\nWait, no, the per-position approach was considering all numbers from 1-488, so the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times, so 4 hundreds, 10 each: 40. But in the two-digit numbers, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (40-49), which is part of the first hundred (1-100). So, in the per-position approach, I should not have considered the two-digit tens place separately because it's already included in the first hundred's tens place count.\n\nWait, that's the mistake. So, in the per-position approach, when I calculated tens place 4's as 40, that includes both two-digit and three-digit numbers. So, in the first approach, I had two-digit tens place 4's as 10 and three-digit tens place 4's as 40, totaling 50, which is incorrect because the per-position approach correctly counts it as 40, including both two-digit and three-digit.\n\nSo, where did I go wrong in the first approach? I think I double-counted the two-digit tens place 4's. Because in the per-position approach, the tens place 4's are 40, which includes both two-digit and three-digit. So, in the first approach, I should have considered that the two-digit tens place 4's are part of the 40. So, in the first approach, I should not have added 10 (two-digit) + 40 (three-digit), but rather just 40.\n\nWait, but in the first approach, I separated single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit, and for two-digit, I counted 10 in tens place and 9 in units place. So, perhaps I should adjust the first approach to match the per-position approach.\n\nWait, let me try to reconcile both methods.\n\nIn the per-position approach:\n\n- Units place 4's:49\n- Tens place 4's:40\n- Hundreds place 4's:89\nTotal 4's:49+40+89=178.\n\nIn the first approach:\n\n- Single-digit 4's:1\n- Two-digit 4's:10(tens)+9(units)=19\n- Three-digit 4's:89(hundreds)+40(tens)+39(units)=168\nTotal:1+19+168=188.\n\nBut according to the per-position approach, it's 178. So, there's a discrepancy of 10. Where is this coming from?\n\nWait, perhaps in the first approach, in three-digit units place, I counted 39 instead of 40, but according to the per-position approach, units place is 49, which includes single and two-digit. So, in the first approach, single-digit and two-digit units place 4's:1+9=10, and three-digit units place 4's:39, totaling 49, which matches. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the first approach, two-digit tens place 4's:10, and three-digit tens place 4's:40, totaling 50, but according to the per-position approach, it's 40. So, that's where the discrepancy is.\n\nWait, perhaps in the per-position approach, the tens place 4's are 40, which includes both two-digit and three-digit. So, in the first approach, I should have only 40 in tens place, not 10 (two-digit) +40 (three-digit). So, in the first approach, I need to adjust.\n\nWait, but in the first approach, I separated two-digit and three-digit, so I think I should continue with that method, but make sure not to double-count.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the per-position approach is more accurate, so the correct total 4's are 178, and 8's are 98, so the difference is 80.\n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting results. Let me try another method: using the formula for digit counting.\n\nThe formula for the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n can be calculated by considering each digit position separately.\n\nFor a given position (units, tens, hundreds), the count can be calculated based on higher digits, current digit, and lower digits.\n\nBut perhaps that's too complicated for now. Alternatively, let me try to recount using the first approach but carefully.\n\nFirst approach:\n\n1. Single-digit 4's:1 (page 4).\n\n2. Two-digit 4's:\n\n   a. Tens place:40-49:10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\n   b. Units place:14,24,...,94:9 numbers, so 9 4's.\n\n   Total two-digit 4's:19.\n\n3. Three-digit 4's:\n\n   a. Hundreds place:400-488:89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\n   b. Tens place:\n\n      - 100-199:140-149:10\n      - 200-299:240-249:10\n      - 300-399:340-349:10\n      - 400-488:440-449:10\n      Total:40.\n\n   c. Units place:\n\n      - 100-199:104,114,...,194:10\n      - 200-299:2"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 pages. So, in each of the 48 blocks, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once at page 484. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49. \n\nNow, the tens place. Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many such blocks are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial block from 401-488. In each full block, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 times. Now, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 401-410, but wait, 401-410 is 10 numbers, but 401-410 is actually part of the 400-499 range, but since our book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears from 401-410, which is 10 numbers, but 401-488 is 88 pages, so 401-410 is entirely within 401-488. Wait, no, 401-410 is 10 pages, but 401-488 is 88 pages, so 401-410 is within that. So, that's another 10 times. But wait, 401-410 is 10 pages, so the tens digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in the partial block. So, total tens place 4's are 40 (from full blocks) + 10 = 50. \n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 1-400, there are 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 tens place 4's, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 401-410, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, total tens place 4's are 50. \n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-499. But our book goes up to 488, so it's 400-488. How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. \n\nWait, but let me confirm that. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since we only go up to 488, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times. \n\nSo, total 4's are units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, plus 89=188. So, total 4's are 188. \n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. \n\nStarting with the units place. Again, in each block of 10, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, similar to the 4's, in each block of 10, 1 time. There are 48 full blocks and a partial block of 8 pages. So, 48\u00d71=48, plus in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once at page 488. So, units place 8's: 48 +1=49. \n\nNow, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such block contributes 10 times. How many full blocks are there? From 1-400, there are 4 full hundreds. Each hundred has one block of 10 where the tens digit is 8. So, 4 blocks \u00d710=40. Now, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49. \n\nWait, let me check that. From 1-400, each hundred has one block of 10 where the tens digit is 8, so 4 blocks \u00d710=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, 9 more. So, total tens place 8's: 40+9=49. \n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0. \n\nSo, total 8's are units + tens + hundreds =49 +49 +0=98. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For the units place, I had 49, tens place 49, and hundreds 0, so total 98. \n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's are 188, total 8's are 98. So, 188 -98=90. \n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 188-98 is 90, but I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each step again. \n\nCounting 4's: \n\nUnits place: 48 full blocks \u00d71=48, plus 1 in the last partial block=49. \n\nTens place: 4 full blocks \u00d710=40, plus in 401-488, 10 numbers (401-410) where tens digit is 4, so 10. So, 40+10=50. \n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89. \n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188. \n\nCounting 8's: \n\nUnits place:48 full blocks \u00d71=48, plus 1 in the last partial block=49. \n\nTens place:4 full blocks \u00d710=40, plus in 401-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 40+9=49. \n\nHundreds place:0. \n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98. \n\nDifference:188-98=90. \n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one '4'.\n   - There are 48 full blocks (1-480) and a partial block (481-488).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 '4's in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).\n   - There are 4 full blocks (1-400), contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - In 401-488, the tens digit '4' appears in 401-410, contributing 10.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is '4' for 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one '8'.\n   - There are 48 full blocks and a partial block.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 '8's in the tens place (e.g., 80-89).\n   - There are 4 full blocks, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - In 401-488, the tens digit '8' appears in 480-488, contributing 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have '8' in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. Now, since the book has 488 pages, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra pages (481-488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times from the complete sets and then once more in 484. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. \n\nWait, no, maybe I should think differently. Actually, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (sets of 10) times 1, plus any extra in the incomplete set. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial decade (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each set of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many full hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages in the next hundred (401-488). So, in each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, 4 full hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449, which is 10 pages, so that's another 10 times. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is only 88 pages, so from 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so yes, that's correct. So, total tens place 4's are 50.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the pages from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, that's 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, units place: 48 full decades, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last partial decade (481-488), units digit 4 occurs once (484). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: Each full hundred contributes 10, so 4 full hundreds: 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's. Each set of 10 has one 8 in the units place. So, 48 full decades, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial decade (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. So, in the last partial decade, units digit 8 occurs once (page 488). So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: Each full hundred contributes 10 times where the tens digit is 8. So, 4 full hundreds: 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. That's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 times. So, tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but in the partial hundred, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480 to 489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, so 4's are 188 and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let's recount the 8's in the tens place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so in each hundred, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, for 4 full hundreds (1-400), that's 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nThen, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nFor the units place, 48 full decades, each contributing 1, so 48, plus 488, which is the 489th number, but wait, 488 is the last page. So, from 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nEach set of 10 has one 8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 occurs once at 488. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nNow, for 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last partial set (481-488), units digit 4 occurs at 484, so 1 more, total 49.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40, plus in the last partial hundred (401-488), tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10, total 50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nSo, 4's: 188, 8's: 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me think again. For the hundreds place, in 1-99, there are no 4's in the hundreds place. From 100-399, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, so no 4's there either. Only from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, there are none in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so 800-899 isn't part of the book.\n\nSo, I think my count is correct. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly for 4's? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I add up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 188. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAnd for 8's: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. So, yes, the difference is 90.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is calculated by examining each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds). \n\n- **Units place**: 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 times, plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place**: 4 appears in 10 consecutive numbers every 100. With 4 full hundreds contributing 40 times, and 10 more in 440-449, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place**: 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n\n- **Units place**: 8 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 complete sets contributing 48 times, plus one in 488, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place**: 8 appears in 10 consecutive numbers every 100. With 4 full hundreds contributing 40 times, and 9 more in 480-488, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place**: No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last group would be 481-490, but since the book ends at 488, I need to adjust for that. Hmm, maybe it's better to calculate the total number of times 4 appears in the units place across all page numbers.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place: Every group of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 4. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. Again, I need to make sure I don't go beyond 488.\n\nFor the hundreds place: Since the book has up to 488 pages, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, pages 100-199 have hundreds digit 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4. So, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488. Let me calculate how many numbers that is: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but I'm supposed to count how many times 4 appears, not how many times it appears in each place. So, maybe I should break it down by each digit place.\n\nLet me try again. For the units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, total groups of 10 in 488 are 48 full groups (since 488 / 10 = 48.8). So, 48 times 1 = 48. But wait, the 49th group is 481-490, but we only go up to 488. So, in the 49th group, the units digit 4 appears once at 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check. From 1 to 480, that's 48 groups of 10, so 48 times. Then from 481 to 488, that's 8 numbers, and 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, yes, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, tens place: How many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Every group of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many full hundreds are there in 488? Four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, total tens place 4's: 50.\n\nNow, hundreds place: As I thought earlier, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4's appear 188 times.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's. I'll need to count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full groups of 10 are there? 48 full groups (488 / 10 = 48.8), so 48 times. Then, in the 49th group (481-490), the units digit 8 appears at 488. So, that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: How many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Again, every group of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems a bit low. Let me check again. For the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since we stop at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49 for tens place. Units place is 49, so total 98. That seems correct.\n\nSo, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once.  \n   - Total groups of 10 in 488: 48 full groups, contributing 48 times.  \n   - In the 49th group (481-488), 484 has a 4 in the units place.  \n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - Every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.  \n   - Four full hundreds (1-400) contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.  \n   - From 401-488, 440-449 adds another 10.  \n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.  \n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.  \n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers.  \n   - Total: 48 (full groups) + 1 (488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - Every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.  \n   - Four full hundreds contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.  \n   - From 401-488, 480-488 adds 9.  \n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - Pages 800-899 would have 8, but the book ends at 488.  \n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. Now, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, I think there are 48 full groups and then 8 extra pages (481-488). So, in each full group, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so no 4's there. So, total 4's in the units place: 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for every group of 100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times every 100 pages. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in pages 40-49, which is 10 pages. Now, how many full hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). So, for each full hundred, there are 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 81-88). Wait, actually, 401-488 is 88 pages, which is 401-490 minus 2 pages (491 and 492, but wait, 401-490 is 90 pages, so 401-488 is 88 pages). So, the tens digit in 401-488 would be 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490). But since we're only going up to 488, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, in the tens place, how many 4's are there in 401-488? Well, the tens digit is 4 in pages 440-449. Wait, no, 401-488: the tens digit cycles every 10. So, 401-410: tens digit 0, 411-420: tens digit 1, ..., 441-450: tens digit 4, but wait, 440-449 would be in 400-499, but our range is 401-488. So, 440 is actually in 401-488? Wait, 440 is within 401-488, yes. So, pages 440-449 have a tens digit of 4, but since we only go up to 488, that's 10 pages (440-449). Wait, but 440 is included, so that's 10 pages. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. Therefore, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 in pages 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these 89 pages. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's printed: 187.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's. I need to count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, in each group of 10, the units digit is 8 once. So, how many full groups of 10 are there in 488? 48 full groups (1-480) and 8 extra pages (481-488). So, units place 8's: 48 times. In the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so page 488 has a units digit of 8. So, that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For every 100 pages, the tens digit is 8 in 10 consecutive numbers. So, in each full hundred, that's 10 8's in the tens place. How many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4*10=40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in pages 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's pages 480-488. Wait, let me think: 401-488. The tens digit is 8 when the tens digit is 8, so 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 480-488. How many pages is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 pages. So, the tens digit is 8 in 9 pages. Therefore, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, total 4's: 187, total 8's: 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 (correct, since 488/10=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, and 481-488 don't add any more 4's in units place).\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 40 + 10 = 50 (correct).\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 4's (correct).\nTotal: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 (correct).\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in 481-488, the units digit is 8 on page 488, so +1, total 49 (correct).\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 40 + 9 = 49 (correct).\n- Hundreds: 0 (correct).\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98 (correct).\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. In the remaining 88 pages (401-488), how many times does the tens digit equal 8? It's from 480-488, which is 9 pages: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 times. So, 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the tens place in another way. For the tens digit to be 8, it's every 100 pages, the 80-89 range. So, in 1-100: 80-89, 10 numbers. Similarly, 101-200: 180-189, another 10. 201-300: 280-289, 10. 301-400: 380-389, 10. So, 40 in total. Then, from 401-488, the next occurrence would be 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so 480-488: 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98, so 187 - 98 = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full groups of 10 in 488 pages (488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8), contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) do not add any more 4's in the units place.\n   - **Total in units place:** 48\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - For every 100 pages, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).\n   - There are 4 full hundreds in 488 pages, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 occurrences.\n   - In the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, adding 10 occurrences.\n   - **Total in tens place:** 40 + 10 = 50\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full groups of 10, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) include page 488, adding 1 occurrence.\n   - **Total in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - For every 100 pages, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89).\n   - There are 4 full hundreds, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 occurrences.\n   - In the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, adding 9 occurrences.\n   - **Total in tens place:** 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 0\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **89**\n\n**Answer:** There are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

Now, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 complete sets, and then an additional 8 pages (481-488). So, in each of the 48 complete sets, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times.

Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 times. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). In each of these, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 times.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. Starting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, in each set of ten, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, 48 complete sets of ten, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8 in the units place. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: In each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for ten consecutive numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10 = 40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. Wait, but 480-488 is actually 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page numbers were 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check the tens place for 8's. In the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 8, that's from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 times, right? So, 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 488 is included, so in the units place, we have 488, which is an 8 in the units place, so that's correct. So, units place 8's: 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 (from 488) = 49. Tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to count the 4's in the hundreds place: 400-488 inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the tens place: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nWait, but another approach: Let's count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) = 48, plus if the remainder is >=4, add 1. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: floor(488/10)=48, plus if 488 mod10 >=8, which it is (8), so 48 +1=49.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)=4, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? It's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. So, total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place: floor(488/100)=4, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 40 +9=49.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/1000)=0, but since we're only up to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nNumber of 8's: floor(488/1000)=0, and since 488 < 800, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188.\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In every block of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks (488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8), contributing 48 fours.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) include one more 4 (page 484).\n   - Total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In every block of 100 pages, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).\n   - There are 4 complete blocks (488 \u00f7 100 = 4.88), contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 fours.\n   - The remaining 88 pages (401-488) include another 10 fours in the tens place (440-449).\n   - Total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have the digit 4 in the hundreds place, totaling 89 pages.\n   - Total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, in every block of 10 pages, the digit 8 appears once.\n   - 48 complete blocks contribute 48 eights.\n   - The remaining 8 pages include one more 8 (page 488).\n   - Total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In every block of 100 pages, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89).\n   - 4 complete blocks contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights.\n   - The remaining 88 pages include 9 eights in the tens place (480-488).\n   - Total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - There are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe it's easier to count the occurrences of 4 in each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4). From 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. Since the book goes up to 488, I can calculate how many complete sets of ten there are and then see if there are any extra pages beyond that. \n\nThe total number of pages is 488, so the number of complete sets of ten is 48 (since 48*10=480). Each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, from 481 to 488, that's 8 more pages, so the units digit cycles from 1 to 8. In this range, the units digit 4 appears once (page 484). So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49. \n\nWait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many times does the units digit 4 occur? For each ten numbers, it occurs once. So, the number of times is equal to the number of tens. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is within that range, adding one more 4. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. \n\nOkay, moving on to the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a range of ten numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all ten pages. Similarly, this happens in each hundred. So, in 1-100, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (40-49). In 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10 times. In 201-300, it's 240-249, another 10 times. In 301-400, it's 340-349, another 10 times. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 more. So, adding these up: 10 (from 40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449) = 50 times. \n\nWait, but does 440-449 fall within 401-488? Yes, because 440 is greater than 401 and 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, total tens place 4's: 50. \n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each page number is from 400 to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's 89 times because each page from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4. \n\nWait, but let me check: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these, so 89 times. \n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place: similar to 4's, for every ten numbers, the units digit 8 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? \n\nNumber of complete tens is 48 (since 48*10=480), each contributing one 8. Then, from 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so page 488 has an 8 in the units place, adding one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, tens place: the digit 8 appears in the tens place for ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is a partial range because 488 is the last page. So, let's calculate each:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n- 180-189: another 10 times.\n- 280-289: another 10 times.\n- 380-389: another 10 times.\n- 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 for all of these, so 9 times.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9 is 49. Yes, that seems right.\n\nNow, hundreds place: the digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, 49 + 49 is 98. Hmm, but let me double-check that. Units:49, tens:49, so yes, 98.\n\nWait, but earlier when counting 4's, I had 188, and 8's as 98, so the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But wait, did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me check again.\n\nWait, when counting 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times. But when I added units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89), that's 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's, units:49, tens:49, so 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I feel like I might have missed something. Let me check the tens place for 4's again. I had 50 times. Let me recount: from 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Yes, that's correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, I had 49. Let me recount: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct.\n\nUnits place for both 4's and 8's:49 each, which seems correct because from 1-488, each digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place across each ten, and the last partial ten adds one more for both 4 and 8.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for 4's again. From 1-480, that's 48 sets of ten, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48. Then from 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 484 is included, adding one more 4. So, 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: from 1-480, 48 times, and 488 adds one more, so 49. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, 8's:98, difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the hundreds place for 4's, I considered 400-488 as 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. But wait, 400-488 is 89 pages, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nWait, but another way to calculate the number of 4's in the hundreds place is to note that from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 times. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are accurate. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - For every set of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of ten, contributing 48 fours.\n   - From 481 to 488, the units digit 4 appears once (page 484).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place for ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 fours, except 440-449, which is fully within 401-488.\n   - Total: 10 (40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449) = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 pages.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, from 1 to 480, there are 48 eights.\n   - From 481 to 488, the units digit 8 appears once (page 488).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each full range contributes 10 eights, and 480-488 contributes 9 eights.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then a partial block of 8 pages (481-488). In each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once in 484. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, in the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, for the tens digit, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49). How many full hundreds are there in 488? That's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial hundred from 401-488. Each full hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488. So, the tens digit is 8 for 481-490, but since we're stopping at 488, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488). Wait, but we're looking for 4's in the tens place. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 in 401-410, 1 in 411-420, ..., up to 8 in 481-490. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times. Therefore, the total 4's in the tens place would be 40 (from the four full hundreds) plus 10 (from 441-450), totaling 50.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, when the tens digit is 4, that's from 440-449, but since we're starting at 401, it's 441-450, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 10 more 4's in the tens place. So, total 4's in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my math again. Units place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, plus 1 in the last partial block, so 49. Tens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40, plus 10 in the partial hundred, so 50. Hundreds place: 89 times. So, 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. Hmm, but wait, that seems correct because the hundreds place contributes a lot.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. Starting with the units place: Again, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so 8 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full tens in 488, so 48 times. Then, in the partial block of 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: In the tens digit, each block of 100 has the tens digit cycling through 0-9, each appearing 10 times. So, in each full hundred, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40. In the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0-8. So, when the tens digit is 8, that's from 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480 is included? Wait, the partial hundred is 401-488, so 480 is within that range. So, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. Therefore, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier, for 4's in the tens place, I had 10 in the partial hundred. Here, for 8's, it's 9 because we stop at 488. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, the digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because 800-899 isn't part of the book. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because I thought earlier that 4's were 188 and 8's were 98, so the difference would be 90. But let me double-check my counts because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's go back to the 8's in the tens place. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nFor the units place, 48 full tens, each contributing 1, and then in the last partial block, 8 appears once (at 488). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nSo, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when counting, especially in the hundreds place, I might have overcounted. Let me recount the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's. That seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: For 4's, units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. Total: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's, units:49, tens:49, total 98. So, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when dealing with the last partial block, I might have miscounted. Let me check the units place for 4's again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many such numbers? The last one is 484, which is 48*10 + 4. So, 48 times, plus the 484, which is the 49th time. So, 49 units place 4's.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: 8,18,28,...,488. The last one is 488, which is the 49th term because 488 is 48*10 + 8, so 49 times.\n\nFor the tens place, 4's: In each hundred, 40-49, 140-149, ..., 340-349, 440-449. So, in each hundred, 10 times, so 4 hundreds give 40, and then in 401-488, 440-449 is included, which is 10 more, so 50.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: In each hundred, 80-89, 180-189, ..., 380-389, 480-488. So, in each hundred, 10 times, so 4 hundreds give 40, and in 401-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49.\n\nSo, yes, 4's: 188, 8's:98, difference 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting, especially in the hundreds place, I might have miscounted. Let me think differently. Maybe I can calculate the total number of digits and see if the counts make sense. But perhaps that's overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write a small program or use a formula to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each place.\n\nBut since I'm doing this manually, let me try another approach. For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFor 4's: As established, 49 times.\n\nFor 8's: 49 times.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's: 50 times.\n\nFor 8's:49 times.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4's:89 times.\n\nFor 8's:0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's, we have 10 in each hundred, so 4*10=40, plus 10 in 440-449, which is within 401-488, so total 50.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, 10 in each hundred, so 4*10=40, plus 9 in 480-488, so 49.\n\nUnits place: both 4 and 8 appear 49 times.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. \n\nFirst, the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of 10 and then 8 more numbers. In each of these 48 sets, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit is 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So, units place 4's: 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a block of 10 numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these blocks contributes 10 instances of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let's figure out how many such blocks there are up to 488. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is another block, but does it go up to 488? Yes, so that's another block. So, how many blocks is that? Let's see: 0-99 (1 block), 100-199 (1), 200-299 (1), 300-399 (1), and 400-488 (1). So that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, from 400-488, the block is 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's fine. So, tens place 4's: 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10 and 8 extra numbers. Each set contributes 1, so 48 times. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1-8, so 8 appears once more (at 488). So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is a partial block. Let me count each block. From 0-99: 80-89 is one block (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, how many full blocks and partial? Let's see: 0-99: 1 block, 100-199:1, 200-299:1, 300-399:1, and 400-488: partial. Each full block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 full blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, the partial block from 480-488: how many 8's in the tens place? The tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check the units place. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the last partial cycle is 8 numbers (481-488), which includes 488. So, in the units place, 8 appears once in the last partial cycle (at 488). So, units place 8's: 48 +1=49, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, as we saw, 49 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but wait a second. When I was counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, but 480-488 is actually 9 numbers (including both 480 and 488). So, that's correct, 9 8's in the tens place from 480-488.\n\nSo, total 8's: 98.\n\nWait, but wait, in the hundreds place, 800-899 would be 8's, but since we only go up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 187, and 8's were 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's.\n\nFor units place: 48 times.\n\nFor tens place: 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\nFor hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nSo, 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, plus 1 in the last partial, so 49.\n\nTens: 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, etc.) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49.\n\nHundreds: 0.\n\nSo, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me recount the 4's in the tens place. From 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. Then 100-199: 140-149, another 10. 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. So that's correct.\n\nAnd for the 8's in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, that's 5 blocks, but the last one is partial. Wait, no, from 0-99: 80-89 is one block (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's 9. So, that's 4 full blocks (each 10) and 1 partial block (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. That's correct.\n\nWait, but in the 4's, we had 5 blocks, each 10, so 50. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, 4's: 187, 8's:98. Difference is 89.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I'm overcounting somewhere.\n\nWait, another way to count the 4's: Let's consider each digit place separately.\n\nUnits place: For each page number, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 pages. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor(488/10)=48, plus if the last partial set has 4 or more, but 488 mod 10 is 8, so the last set is 481-488, which doesn't include a 4 in the units place. So, units place 4's:48.\n\nTens place: The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49, etc.). So, how many hundreds are there? 488 is 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) plus 88 pages into the 400-488 range. So, in each hundred, 10 numbers have 4 in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's:40+10=50.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488, which is 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, hundreds place 4's:89.\n\nTotal 4's:48+50+89=187.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place: Same logic, floor(488/10)=48, and the last partial set (481-488) includes 488, so units digit 8 appears once more. So, units place 8's:48+1=49.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 for 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges is 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last range, 480-488, is 9 numbers, so 9. Total tens place 8's:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: As before, no 8's in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488. So, 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference:187-98=89.\n\nWait, but wait, I'm getting 89 as the difference, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the 4's count. Let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: For each digit place, calculate how many times 4 appears and how many times 8 appears.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write a small table to count the occurrences.\n\nBut I think my initial approach is correct. So, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 89.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. Maybe I'm missing something in the 8's count. For the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. But 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, yes, 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's, in the tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. So, that's correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n\n1. **Units place:** \n   - Every 10 consecutive numbers have one '4' in the units place.\n   - Total sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full sets, contributing 48 '4's.\n   - The last 8 numbers (481-488) don't add any '4's in the units place.\n   - **Total units place '4's:** 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:** \n   - '4' appears in the tens place for blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - There are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - Each block contributes 10 '4's, except the last block which is only 10 numbers (440-449).\n   - **Total tens place '4's:** 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** \n   - '4' appears in all numbers from 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - **Total hundreds place '4's:** 89.\n\n**Total '4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the digit '8':**\n\n1. **Units place:** \n   - Similar to '4's, 48 full sets of 10 contribute 48 '8's.\n   - The last 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, adding one more '8'.\n   - **Total units place '8's:** 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** \n   - '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - There are 4 full blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 '8's.\n   - The last block (400-488) includes 480-488, contributing 9 '8's.\n   - **Total tens place '8's:** 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** \n   - No '8's since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total hundreds place '8's:** 0.\n\n**Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = **89**.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' appears 89 more times than the digit '8' in the page numbers.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Maybe I can separate the counting based on the number of digits. \n\nFirst, single-digit page numbers: 1-9. Here, the digit 4 appears exactly once, on page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence. \n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: 10-99. I think I should consider each digit place separately. The tens place and the units place. \n\nIn the tens place for two-digit numbers, the 4 can appear in 40-49. That's 10 pages where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 10 occurrences. \n\nIn the units place, the 4 appears once every 10 numbers, like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, ..., 94. From 10-99, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, starting at 14, each 10 pages after that, so from 14 to 94, that's 9 times (14,24,...,94). Wait, but 44 has two 4's, so in the units place, each occurrence is just once per ten. Wait, no, actually, each two-digit number where the units digit is 4 will have exactly one 4 in the units place, regardless of the tens digit. So, from 10-99, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? Let me see: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 9 occurrences. \n\nWait, but in 44, the tens digit is also 4, so that's another 4. So, in the two-digit numbers, the 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49) and 9 times in the units place (14,24,...,94), but 44 is counted twice because it has two 4's. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers would be 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19, but since 44 is included in both, it's actually 19, but wait, no, because 44 is just one number where both digits are 4, so each digit is counted separately. So, the total number of 4's in two-digit numbers is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. But wait, 44 is part of both, so does that mean I'm counting the two 4's in 44 correctly? Let me check: 40-49 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, each contributing one 4, so that's 10. Then, in the units place, from 14,24,...,94, that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4, so that's 9. So, 10 + 9 = 19, but 44 is one of those, so it's actually two 4's, so the total is correct because each 4 is counted separately. So, 19 4's in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100-488. This is a bit more complex because we have hundreds, tens, and units places. I think I should break it down by each digit place.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. In three-digit numbers from 100-488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, let's see how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. We need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens digit from 100-488. Let's think about it. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, and 4, we can calculate the number of times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, and 3: Each of these has a full set of tens digits from 0-9, so for each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). So, for hundreds 1, 2, 3, that's 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 3*10=30 occurrences.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: The tens digit 4 appears in 440-449. But wait, our upper limit is 488, so 440-449 is within that range. So, that's 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. So, 10 occurrences.\n\nBut wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, total for tens place: 30 (from 100-399) +10 (from 400-488) =40 occurrences.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. Similarly, we need to count how many times 4 appears in the units digit from 100-488. Again, let's break it down by hundreds.\n\nFor hundreds digits 1,2,3: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the units digit is 4 (e.g., 104,114,...,194; 204,214,...,294; 304,314,...,394). So, for each hundred, that's 10 occurrences, and with three hundreds, that's 3*10=30.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: Now, we have to be careful because the upper limit is 488. So, the units digit cycles from 0-9 in each ten. So, for 400-488, how many times does the units digit 4 appear? Well, from 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, starting at 400, the first number with units digit 4 is 404, then 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, 484 is within 488, but 494 would be beyond 488, so let's count how many there are. From 400-488, the units digit 4 appears in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the units place. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 484 is the last one before 488, so that's correct. So, total units digit 4's in the hundreds digit 4 is 9.\n\nSo, total units digit 4's in three-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) +9 (from 400-488) =39.\n\nWait, but let me check: For hundreds 1,2,3, each has 10 numbers where units digit is 4, so 3*10=30. Then, for hundreds 4, from 400-488, how many numbers have units digit 4? Let's see, starting at 400, the first is 404, then every 10 pages: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488, and the next would be 494, which is beyond 488. So, yes, 9. So, total units digit 4's in three-digit numbers: 30+9=39.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the number of times units digit is 4 is floor(89/10) +1? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, from 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 88 numbers after 400, so 8 full sets of 10 (400-479 is 80 numbers), so 8 times 10, which would be 8 times the units digits 0-9, so 8 times 1 occurrence of 4, so 8. Then, from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, the units digits are 0-8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total units digit 4's in 400-488 is 8. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 9. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me count them: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers. So, from 400-488, 488-400=88, so 88+1=89 numbers. So, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers, so 8 full cycles (400-479) is 80 numbers, which would have 8 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Then, from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, the units digits go from 0-8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total units digit 4's in 400-488 is 8. But wait, when I listed them, I got 9. Let me check again: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers. Wait, but 484 is within 488, so that's correct. So, maybe the way I'm calculating it is wrong. Let me think differently: The number of times the units digit is 4 in 400-488 is equal to the number of times 4 appears in the units place in each ten. So, from 400-488, the first number is 400, and the last is 488. The units digit cycles every 10, so the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete tens plus one if the last number is beyond.\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to calculate how many numbers between 400 and 488 have units digit 4. The first such number is 404, and the last is 484. The difference between them is 484-404=80, and since the step is 10, the number of terms is (80/10)+1=9. So, that's 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences. So, I think my initial count was correct, 9. So, maybe my earlier way of thinking about it was wrong. So, the total units digit 4's in 400-488 is 9. So, total units digit 4's in three-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) +9 (from 400-488) =39.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I thought of 400-488 as 89 numbers, and the units digit cycles every 10, I thought it would be 8 full cycles, giving 8 occurrences, but actually, it's 9 because 484 is included. So, maybe it's better to think of it as the number of times 4 appears in the units place from 400-488 is 9. So, I'll go with that.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place 89, tens place 40, units place 39. So, 89+40+39=168.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. Tens place: 40 occurrences, as calculated earlier. Units place: 39. So, 89+40+39=168.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in all page numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit: 1-9. The digit 8 appears once, on page 8. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: 10-99. Again, let's break it down into tens and units places.\n\nTens place: The 8 appears in 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: The 8 appears once every 10 numbers, like 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nBut wait, 88 has two 8's, so in the units place, we're counting each occurrence, so 9 is correct because 18,28,...,98 are 9 numbers, each with one 8 in the units place, including 88. So, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) +9 (units) =19.\n\nNow, three-digit numbers: 100-488. Let's break it down again.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, 8 appears in the hundreds place only in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nTens place: Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens digit from 100-488.\n\nFor hundreds digits 1,2,3: Each hundred has a full set of tens digits, so 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, 380-389). So, 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 occurrences, so 3*10=30.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Each of these has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's in three-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) +9 (from 400-488) =39.\n\nUnits place: Now, let's count how many times 8 appears in the units digit from 100-488.\n\nAgain, break it down by hundreds.\n\nFor hundreds digits 1,2,3: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the units digit is 8 (e.g., 108,118,...,198; 208,218,...,298; 308,318,...,398). So, 3 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 3*10=30.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: From 400-488, the units digit 8 appears in numbers like 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Let's count how many there are. Starting at 408, each 10 numbers: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the units place.\n\nSo, total units place 8's in three-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) +9 (from 400-488) =39.\n\nWait, but let me check: From 400-488, how many numbers have units digit 8? The first is 408, then every 10 pages up to 488. So, 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place 0, tens place 39, units place 39. So, 0+39+39=78.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Tens place: 30 from 100-399 and 9 from 400-488, total 39. Units place: 30 from 100-399 and 9 from 400-488, total 39. So, yes, 39+39=78.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's and 8's.\n\nTotal 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) =1+19=20+168=188.\n\nWait, 1 (single-digit) +19 (two-digit)=20, plus 168 (three-digit)=188.\n\nTotal 8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78)=1+19=20+78=98.\n\nWait, 1+19=20, plus 78=98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the three-digit counts. Let me go through the 4's again.\n\nThree-digit 4's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\n- Tens place: For hundreds 1,2,3, each contributes 10 (e.g., 140-149, etc.), so 3*10=30. For hundreds 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. So, total tens place 4's: 30+10=40.\n\n- Units place: For hundreds 1,2,3, each contributes 10, so 3*10=30. For hundreds 4, from 400-488, units digit 4 appears in 404,414,...,484, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, total units place 4's:30+9=39.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168, which matches what I had before.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\n- Tens place: For hundreds 1,2,3, each contributes 10, so 3*10=30. For hundreds 4, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, total tens place 8's:30+9=39.\n\n- Units place: For hundreds 1,2,3, each contributes 10, so 3*10=30. For hundreds 4, from 400-488, units digit 8 appears in 408,418,...,488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, total units place 8's:30+9=39.\n\nSo, 39+39=78, which matches.\n\nSo, total 4's:1+19+168=188.\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to miscount, especially in the three-digit numbers. Let me try another approach to verify.\n\nAlternative approach: For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), count the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, so 488/10=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), which include 484, so that's one more. So, total 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 1 (single-digit) +9 (two-digit) +39 (three-digit)=49. Wait, but in my earlier count, I had 1 (units in single-digit) +9 (units in two-digit) +39 (units in three-digit)=49. So, that's consistent.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place:\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488/10=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), which include 488, so that's one more. So, total 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 1 (single-digit) +9 (two-digit) +39 (three-digit)=49. So, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but in my earlier count, I had 4's in units place as 49, and 8's as 49, but that can't be because in the problem, the difference is 90, which would mean 4's are more than 8's by 90, but if units digits are the same, maybe the difference comes from tens and hundreds places.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each, so the difference in units place is 0. Then, the difference must come from tens and hundreds places.\n\nWait, but in my earlier count, I had 188 4's and 98 8's, so a difference of 90. Let me see where that comes from.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the alternative approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, when I count the number of times a digit appears in a particular place, I can use a formula. For example, in the units place, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n is equal to (n // 10) * 1 + min(max(n % 10 - d + 1, 0), 10). But maybe that's complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit place, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears: floor(488/10) =48 full tens, each contributing one 4, plus if the last partial ten has numbers >=4, then add 1. Since 488 %10=8 >=4, so add 1. So, total 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: floor(488/10)=48, and 488%10=8 >=8, so add 1. So, 48+1=49.\n\nSo, units place: 49 4's and 49 8's, difference 0.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in tens place: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9. So, for hundreds 0-4 (since 488 is in the 400s), the number of times 4 appears in the tens place is:\n\nFor hundreds 0 (which is 1-99): 10 numbers (40-49).\n\nFor hundreds 1,2,3: Each has 10 numbers (140-149, etc.), so 3*10=30.\n\nFor hundreds 4: The tens digit 4 appears in 440-449. Now, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's:10+30+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place:\n\nFor hundreds 0: 10 numbers (80-89).\n\nFor hundreds 1,2,3: Each has 10 numbers (180-189, etc.), so 3*10=30.\n\nFor hundreds 4: The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488).\n\nSo, total tens place 8's:10+30+9=49.\n\nSo, tens place: 50 4's and 49 8's, difference +1.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nNumber of times 8 appears in hundreds place: From 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are 0 occurrences.\n\nSo, hundreds place:89 4's and 0 8's, difference +89.\n\nNow, summing up the differences:\n\nUnits place:0\n\nTens place:+1\n\nHundreds place:+89\n\nTotal difference:0+1+89=90.\n\nSo, the number of 4's exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the detailed count, I had 188 4's and 98 8's, which is also a difference of 90. So, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but in the alternative approach, I calculated the number of 4's in tens place as 50, but in the detailed count, I had 40. That's a discrepancy. Let me check where I went wrong.\n\nWait, in the detailed count, for three-digit numbers, I had tens place 4's as 40. But in the alternative approach, I have 50. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, in the detailed count, for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds 1,2,3: Each contributes 10 tens place 4's, so 3*10=30.\n\n- Hundreds 4: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's in three-digit numbers:30+10=40.\n\nBut in the alternative approach, I considered hundreds 0 (1-99) contributing 10, hundreds 1,2,3 contributing 30, and hundreds 4 contributing 10, so total 10+30+10=50.\n\nWait, but in the detailed count, I separated single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers. So, in the detailed count, the tens place 4's in two-digit numbers (40-49) is 10, and in three-digit numbers, it's 40, so total 50. So, that matches the alternative approach.\n\nWait, but in my initial detailed count, I had:\n\nTotal 4's:1 (single-digit) +19 (two-digit) +168 (three-digit)=188.\n\nBut in the alternative approach, units place:49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89, so total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0, total 49+49=98.\n\nSo, that's consistent. So, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should break it down by the number of digits. \n\nFirst, single-digit page numbers: 1-9. Here, the digits are 1 through 9. The digit 4 appears once (page 4), and the digit 8 appears once (page 8). So, in single-digit pages, 4 occurs 1 time and 8 occurs 1 time. That means the difference here is zero. Now, moving on to two-digit page numbers: 10-99. Each two-digit number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should count the number of 4's and 8's in both places separately. \n\nStarting with the tens place: For the tens digit, the numbers from 40-49 will have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 pages (40 to 49), so 10 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place. Similarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place, the numbers from 80-89 will have an 8 in the tens place, which is another 10 pages, so 10 times the digit 8 appears in the tens place. \n\nNow, for the units place: In the units digit, every block of ten numbers will have one 4 and one 8. For example, from 10-19, the 4 is in 14 and the 8 is in 18. This pattern repeats every ten numbers. So, how many such blocks are there from 10 to 99? There are 9 blocks (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99). But wait, from 10-99, there are actually 90 numbers, which makes 9 blocks of ten. Wait, no, actually, 10-99 is 90 numbers, so 9 blocks of ten. So, in each block, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Therefore, for the units place, the digit 4 appears 9 times, and the digit 8 appears 9 times. \n\nAdding up the tens and units places for two-digit numbers: For 4's, 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. For 8's, 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. So, in two-digit pages, both 4's and 8's appear 19 times each. The difference here is also zero. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100-488. This is a bit more complex because we have hundreds, tens, and units places. Let's break it down by each place. \n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, pages 100-199 have 1 in the hundreds place, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4. \n\nI need to count how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. Let's see, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nNow, how about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears zero times in the hundreds place. \n\nNext, the tens place: For three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 0-9. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place across all three-digit page numbers from 100-488. \n\nLet's break it down by hundreds. \n\n1. For pages 100-199: The tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 pages. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. Wait, actually, each hundred block (like 100-199) has 100 numbers, which is 10 blocks of 10. So, in each hundred, the digit in the tens place cycles 0-9 ten times. Wait, no, each hundred has 100 numbers, so the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. \n\nAlternatively, for each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), I can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place. \n\nStarting with 100-199: The tens digit goes from 0-9 for each set of ten pages. So, in 100-199, the tens digit is 4 for pages 140-149, which is 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit is 8 for pages 180-189, which is another 10 times. So, in 100-199, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times. \n\nSimilarly, for 200-299: The tens digit is 4 for pages 240-249 (10 times), and 8 for pages 280-289 (10 times). \n\nSame for 300-399: Tens digit 4 appears in 340-349 (10 times), and 8 in 380-389 (10 times). \n\nNow, for 400-488: The tens digit cycles from 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449, which is 10 pages. The tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, not 10. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here. \n\nSo, adding up for the tens place across all three-digit numbers: \n\nFor 4's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-449) = 40 times. \n\nFor 8's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (480-488) = 39 times. \n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 40 times, and 8's appear 39 times. \n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, let's break it down by hundreds. \n\nFor each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the units digit cycles 0-9 every page. So, in each hundred, for each ten, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears once in the units place every ten pages, and similarly for 8. \n\nLet's calculate for each hundred: \n\n1. 100-199: For each ten (like 100-109, 110-119, etc.), the units digit is 4 once (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194). There are 10 such tens, so 10 times 4 appears in the units place. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the units place (108, 118, ..., 198). \n\n2. 200-299: Similarly, 4 appears 10 times in the units place, and 8 appears 10 times. \n\n3. 300-399: Same as above, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the units place. \n\n4. 400-488: Now, this is a bit tricky because it's not a full hundred. Let's see. The units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, from 400-488, that's 89 pages. Let's see how many complete tens we have. \n\nWait, from 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, how many complete tens are there? Let's see, 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 pages, so the last ten isn't complete. \n\nSo, from 400-488, there are 8 complete tens (400-409 up to 470-479) and one incomplete ten (480-488). \n\nIn each complete ten, the units digit 4 appears once, so 8 times 1 = 8 times. The units digit 8 appears once in each complete ten, so 8 times. \n\nNow, in the incomplete ten, 480-488: The units digits go from 0-8. So, does 4 appear? Yes, at 484. Does 8 appear? Yes, at 488. So, that's one more 4 and one more 8. \n\nSo, in 400-488, units digit 4 appears 8 (from complete tens) + 1 (from incomplete) = 9 times. Similarly, units digit 8 appears 8 + 1 = 9 times. \n\nWait, but let me check that. From 400-409: 404 has a 4. 408 has an 8. Similarly, each ten up to 470-479 will have a 4 and an 8 in the units place. Then, 480-488: 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So, yes, 9 times each. \n\nSo, adding up for the units place across all three-digit numbers: \n\nFor 4's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times. \n\nFor 8's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times. \n\nSo, in the units place, both 4's and 8's appear 39 times. \n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences of 4's and 8's in three-digit numbers. \n\nFor 4's: Hundreds place (89) + Tens place (40) + Units place (39) = 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 times. \n\nFor 8's: Hundreds place (0) + Tens place (39) + Units place (39) = 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 times. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. \n\nHundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0. \n\nTens place: 4's = 40, 8's = 39. \n\nUnits place: 4's = 39, 8's = 39. \n\nSo, total 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. \n\nTotal 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78. \n\nWait, that seems correct. \n\nNow, let's sum up all occurrences across all page numbers. \n\nSingle-digit: 4's = 1, 8's = 1. \n\nTwo-digit: 4's = 19, 8's = 19. \n\nThree-digit: 4's = 168, 8's = 78. \n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188. \n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98. \n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again. \n\nWait, in three-digit numbers, hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0. \n\nTens place: 4's = 40, 8's = 39. \n\nUnits place: 4's = 39, 8's = 39. \n\nSo, 4's total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. \n\n8's total: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78. \n\nSingle-digit: 4's =1, 8's=1. \n\nTwo-digit: 4's=19, 8's=19. \n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188. \n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98. \n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. \n\nWait, but let me think again about the three-digit numbers. Did I count correctly? \n\nIn the hundreds place, 4's from 400-488: 89 pages, so 89 times. \n\nIn the tens place: For each hundred, 10 times for 4's, except the last one where it's 10 times as well because 400-449 is 50 pages, so 10 times. Wait, no, earlier I thought 400-488: tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. Similarly, 8 in the tens place is from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. \n\nWait, but earlier I added 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 for 4's in the tens place, but that's not correct because 400-488 is the last hundred, and the tens digit 4 occurs only 10 times (440-449), and 8 occurs 9 times (480-488). So, total tens place for 4's in three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-449) = 40. \n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (480-488) = 39. \n\nSo that part seems correct. \n\nIn units place, for three-digit numbers, each hundred has 10 times 4's and 10 times 8's in units place, except the last hundred (400-488) which has 9 times each. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 for both 4's and 8's in units place. \n\nSo, yes, that seems correct. \n\nTherefore, total 4's: 168, 8's:78. \n\nAdding single and two-digit: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188, and 1 + 19 + 78 = 98. \n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nI think that's correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14; and so on. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each complete set, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (page 484). So, total units digit 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, in each set of a hundred numbers, the digit 4 appears ten times in the tens place. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, which is ten times. Since we have 488 pages, that's four complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each of the four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears ten times, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is ten times. So, adding that, total tens digit 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the pages from 400-488. How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these 89 pages. So, 89 times.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I might have made a mistake here. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, it's actually 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times. So, adding up the hundreds, tens, and units places: 89 (hundreds) + 50 (tens) + 49 (units) = 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, looking at units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place: For every set of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. From 1-488, how many complete sets of ten are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets and 8 extra numbers (481-488). Each complete set contributes 1, so 48 times. In the extra 8 numbers, the units digit 8 appears once (page 488). So, total units digit 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, tens place: In each set of a hundred numbers, the digit 8 appears ten times in the tens place, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are four complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488. That's 9 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (pages 480-488). Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we stop at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. So, total tens digit 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds digit 8's: 0.\n\nSo, adding up the hundreds, tens, and units places: 0 (hundreds) + 49 (tens) + 49 (units) = 98 times the digit 8 appears.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units: 49, Tens: 49, Hundreds: 0. So, 49+49=98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the 4's and 8's.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49+50+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49+49=98\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 occurrences, plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. In 1-400, this happens 4 times (40-49, 140-149, etc.), contributing 40 occurrences. In 401-488, 440-449 adds another 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears 10 times every 100 numbers, contributing 40, plus 9 more in 480-488, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, for the units place. In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers, which makes 48 full groups of ten (since 48*10=480) and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times for each group of ten, plus one more in the last partial group if there's a 484. Wait, 484 is within 481-488, so that's another 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's would be 48*1 + 1 = 49 times? Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (each decade has 10 numbers) plus any extra in the last partial decade. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing 1 four in the units place. So that's 48 fours. Then, in the last partial decade, which is 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 is the only number where the units digit is 4. So, that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. For the tens digit, 4 appears as the tens digit in entire decades, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see. The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), the next is 140-149, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? So that's five blocks. Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 blocks * 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but does 440-449 count? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in each of these, the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's printed is 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place. Similar to 4's, each group of ten has one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, there are 48 complete decades, each contributing 1 eight, so 48 eights. Then, in the last partial decade, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is the only number where the units digit is 8. So, that's one more. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place. The tens digit is 8 in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there in 488? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four blocks. So, 4 * 10 = 40 eights in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, total number of 8's printed is 89.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 99.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 complete decades (1-480) each contributing 1 four, so 48. Then, 481-488: 484 has a 4 in units, so +1. Total 49.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each with 10 fours. 5*10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in hundreds place. So 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 complete decades, each with one 8, so 48. Then, 488 has an 8 in units, so +1. Total 49.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Four blocks, each with 10 eights. 4*10=40.\n\n- Hundreds place: None, as 800-899 is beyond 488. So 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+40=89.\n\nSo, 188 - 89 = 99. Therefore, there are 99 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly for the tens place of 4's. The blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each with 10 numbers. So 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place of 4's, 48 complete decades and one more in 484, so 49. Correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 48 decades +1 in 488, so 49. Tens place: four blocks, each 10, so 40. So total 89.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 - 89 = 99.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Each group of ten numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) has exactly one 4 in the units place.  \n   - There are 48 complete groups of ten in 488 pages, contributing 48 fours.  \n   - The last partial group (481-488) includes 484, adding one more 4.  \n   - Total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   - Each range contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such ranges.  \n   - Total tens place 4's: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488, which includes 89 numbers.  \n   - Total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Each group of ten numbers has exactly one 8 in the units place.  \n   - There are 48 complete groups of ten, contributing 48 eights.  \n   - The last partial group (481-488) includes 488, adding one more 8.  \n   - Total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, and 380-389.  \n   - Each range contributes 10 eights, and there are 4 such ranges.  \n   - Total tens place 8's: 4 * 10 = 40.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8 within 1-488.  \n   - Total hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 89.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 99.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{99}"

    "text": " Maybe I can separate the counting based on the number of digits in the page numbers. So, single-digit pages are 1-9. In this range, the digit 4 appears exactly once, which is on page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence of 4. Now, moving on to two-digit pages, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should count the number of 4's in the tens place and the number of 4's in the units place separately. \n\nStarting with the tens place: For two-digit numbers, the tens digit ranges from 1 to 9. If the tens digit is 4, then the numbers are 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place for two-digit numbers. \n\nNow, for the units place: The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each tens digit. So, for each set of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. Since there are 9 sets of ten in the two-digit numbers (10-99), that's 9 occurrences. But wait, actually, from 10-99, there are 9 decades (10s, 20s, ..., 90s), so each decade has one 4 in the units place. So, 9 times 1, which is 9. Therefore, in the units place for two-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 9 times. \n\nAdding those together, for two-digit numbers, 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because there are three places: hundreds, tens, and units. Let me break this down as well.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, since the book has 488 pages. So, numbers from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. \n\nI think I should consider the hundreds place separately. Let's see how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Well, only in the 400-488 range, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. Here, the tens digit can be 0-9, and the hundreds digit is 1-4. So, for each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, etc.), the tens digit cycles from 0-9, and within each of those, the units digit cycles from 0-9. So, for each hundreds group, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). Since there are 4 hundreds groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), but wait, 400-488 is a partial group. Hmm, so I need to be careful here.\n\nWait, actually, for the tens place, in each complete hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, that's 3 groups times 10, which is 30. But for the 400-488 group, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, in 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 occurrences. So, total in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 30 + 10 = 40.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. Similarly, the units digit cycles from 0-9 for each combination of hundreds and tens digits. So, for each hundreds group, in each tens group, the units digit 4 appears once. So, for each hundreds group, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? For each hundreds group (100-199, etc.), there are 10 tens digits (0-9), each with 10 units digits, so 10 times per hundreds group. So, 4 hundreds groups would have 4*10=40. But wait, 400-488 is only up to 488, so does that affect the units place? Let me think. From 400-488, the units digit still cycles through 0-9 for each tens digit up to 8. So, for tens digits 0-8, each has a 4 in the units place, but for tens digit 9, we only go up to 488, which is 488, so units digits go up to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place for tens digit 9. Hmm, so maybe I need to adjust.\n\nWait, let's break it down more carefully. For the units place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- For hundreds groups 100-399: Each of these has 100 numbers, so the units digit 4 appears 10 times per hundreds group. So, 3 hundreds groups * 10 = 30 times.\n\n- For hundreds group 400-488: Now, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see, from 400-488, the units digit 4 appears in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, that's 9 times because the last number is 488, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488. So, actually, from 400-488, the units digit 4 appears 9 times. So, total units digit 4's in three-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 40, but now I'm getting 39. Let me check again. From 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because after 484, the next would be 494, which is beyond 488. So, yes, 9 times. So, total units digit 4's in three-digit numbers: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, putting it all together for three-digit numbers: hundreds place has 89, tens place has 40, units place has 39. So, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Tens place: 10 per hundreds group for 4 groups, but the 400-488 group only has 10 in the tens place (440-449). So, 3*10 + 10 = 40. Units place: 3*10 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39. So, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. That seems correct.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n\n- Two-digit: 19\n\n- Three-digit: 168\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the three-digit numbers. Let me recount the three-digit numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as for each digit place separately across all page numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the number of 4's in each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nSimilarly, I can do the same for 8's.\n\nBut perhaps I should first stick to 4's.\n\nSo, starting over, perhaps a more systematic way is to consider each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately and count how many times 4 appears in each.\n\nFor units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nWell, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-488, there are 488 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last number, so the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times.\n\nWait, but actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4, and then in the last partial group (481-488), does 4 appear in the units place? 484 is in that group, so that's one more. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 39 in three-digit numbers, but perhaps that was a mistake. Wait, no, perhaps I'm conflating single and two-digit numbers. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps the better way is to consider all page numbers from 001 to 488, padding with leading zeros to make them three digits, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, let's think of each digit place separately.\n\nSo, for the units place:\n\nThe number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated as follows:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(N / 10)\n\nEach complete group contributes one 4.\n\nThen, check if the remainder (N % 10) is >=4, if so, add 1.\n\nSo, for N=488:\n\nfloor(488 / 10) = 48, so 48 times.\n\n488 % 10 = 8, which is >=4, so add 1 more.\n\nTotal units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\nThe number of times 4 appears in the tens place can be calculated by considering each group of 100 numbers. In each group of 100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNumber of complete hundreds in 488: floor(488 / 100) = 4 (since 4*100=400, 5*100=500 which is beyond 488).\n\nSo, for each of the first 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each. So, 4*10=40.\n\nNow, check the remaining numbers from 401-488. How many times does 4 appear in the tens place here?\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8 (since 488 is the last number). So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 40, but now it's 50. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me think again. For the tens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, from 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 more, making it 50.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 50.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place:\n\nThe hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nTherefore, total 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49\n\nTens place: 50\n\nHundreds place: 89\n\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nNumber of times 8 appears in the units place from 1 to 488.\n\nUsing the same method as for 4's:\n\nfloor(488 / 10) = 48, so 48 times.\n\n488 % 10 = 8, which is equal to 8, so add 1 more.\n\nTotal units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nEach hundred has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nFrom 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nThe hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit 8 never appears. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49\n\nTens place: 49\n\nHundreds place: 0\n\nTotal: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 8's appear 98 times.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was counting 4's in three-digit numbers, I thought the units place was 39, but now using this method, it's 49. That seems conflicting. Let me check where I went wrong.\n\nWait, in the initial approach, I separated single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers, and for three-digit numbers, I calculated units place 4's as 39, but using the digit place method, it's 49. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach by not considering that in single-digit and two-digit numbers, the units place also contributes to the total. So, in the initial approach, I only considered three-digit numbers for units place 4's, but in reality, units place 4's also occur in single-digit and two-digit numbers.\n\nWait, in the initial approach, I had:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 4)\n\nTwo-digit: 9 (units place) + 10 (tens place) = 19\n\nThree-digit: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nBut when using the digit place method, units place 4's are 49, which includes single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nSo, perhaps in the initial approach, I correctly accounted for all 4's, but when I broke it down into digit places, I was also correct. So, perhaps both methods give the same result, which is 188 4's and 98 8's, leading to a difference of 90.\n\nWait, but let me verify with a smaller example to see if the digit place method works.\n\nSuppose we have a 20-page book. Let's count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nPages 1-20.\n\nSingle-digit: 1-9.\n\n4 appears once (page 4).\n\n8 appears once (page 8).\n\nTwo-digit: 10-20.\n\nUnits place: 4 appears in 14, so once.\n\nTens place: 4 appears in 40-49, but since we're only going up to 20, no 4's in tens place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 (single) + 1 (units in two-digit) = 2.\n\n8's: 1 (single) + 1 (units in two-digit, page 18) = 2.\n\nSo, difference is 0.\n\nNow, using the digit place method:\n\nUnits place 4's: floor(20/10) = 2, and 20%10 >=4? 20%10=0, which is less than 4, so units place 4's: 2.\n\nTens place 4's: floor(20/100)=0, so 0. Plus, in the remaining 0-20, tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, which is beyond 20, so 0.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 2 + 0 + 0 = 2.\n\nSimilarly, units place 8's: floor(20/10)=2, 20%10=0 <8, so units place 8's: 2.\n\nTens place 8's: floor(20/100)=0, and in 0-20, tens digit 8 occurs in 80-89, which is beyond 20, so 0.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 2 + 0 + 0 = 2.\n\nDifference: 0, which matches the manual count.\n\nWait, but in reality, from 1-20, 4's are on pages 4 and 14: 2 times. 8's are on 8 and 18: 2 times. So, correct.\n\nBut wait, using the digit place method, units place 4's: floor(20/10)=2, but in reality, it's 2 (4 and 14). Similarly, units place 8's: floor(20/10)=2 (8 and 18). So, correct.\n\nNow, let's try with a 30-page book.\n\nPages 1-30.\n\nSingle-digit: 1-9.\n\n4: page 4.\n\n8: page 8.\n\nTwo-digit: 10-30.\n\nUnits place 4's: 14, 24: 2 times.\n\nTens place 4's: 40-49, which is beyond 30, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 2 = 3.\n\n8's: units place: 18, 28: 2 times.\n\nTens place 8's: 80-89, beyond 30, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nDifference: 0.\n\nUsing the digit place method:\n\nUnits place 4's: floor(30/10)=3, 30%10=0 <4, so 3.\n\nBut actual units place 4's: 4,14,24: 3 times.\n\nTens place 4's: floor(30/100)=0, and in 0-30, tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, which is beyond 30, so 0.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 3 + 0 + 0 = 3.\n\nSimilarly, units place 8's: floor(30/10)=3, 30%10=0 <8, so 3.\n\nBut actual units place 8's: 8,18,28: 3 times.\n\nTens place 8's: floor(30/100)=0, and in 0-30, tens digit 8 occurs in 80-89, beyond 30, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 3 + 0 + 0 = 3.\n\nDifference: 0.\n\nWait, but in reality, from 1-30, 4's are on 4,14,24: 3 times.\n\n8's are on 8,18,28: 3 times. So, correct.\n\nNow, let's try with a 44-page book.\n\nPages 1-44.\n\nSingle-digit: 1-9.\n\n4: page 4.\n\n8: page 8.\n\nTwo-digit: 10-44.\n\nUnits place 4's: 14,24,34,44: 4 times.\n\nTens place 4's: 40-44: 5 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + (4 +5) = 10.\n\n8's: units place: 18,28,38: 3 times.\n\nTens place 8's: 80-89, beyond 44, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 +3=4.\n\nDifference: 10-4=6.\n\nUsing the digit place method:\n\nUnits place 4's: floor(44/10)=4, 44%10=4 >=4, so 4+1=5.\n\nWait, but actual units place 4's: 4,14,24,34,44: 5 times.\n\nTens place 4's: floor(44/100)=0, and in 0-44, tens digit 4 occurs in 40-44, which is 5 numbers, so 5 times.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 5 +5 +0=10.\n\nUnits place 8's: floor(44/10)=4, 44%10=4 <8, so 4 times.\n\nBut actual units place 8's: 8,18,28,38: 4 times.\n\nTens place 8's: floor(44/100)=0, and in 0-44, tens digit 8 occurs in 80-89, which is beyond 44, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 4 +0 +0=4.\n\nDifference: 10-4=6.\n\nWhich matches manual count.\n\nSo, the digit place method works.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, using the digit place method:\n\n4's:\n\nUnits place: 49\n\nTens place: 50\n\nHundreds place: 89\n\nTotal: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits place: 49\n\nTens place:49\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was counting three-digit numbers, I thought units place 4's were 39, but using the digit place method, it's 49. So, perhaps I was mistaken in the initial approach by not considering that units place 4's also occur in single and two-digit numbers. So, the correct total is 188 4's and 98 8's, difference of 90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can break it down by the number of digits in the page numbers. \n\nFirst, single-digit pages: 1-9. In this range, the only page with a 4 is page 4. So, that's one 4. No 8's here because 8 is also a single-digit, but we're only counting 4's for now. \n\nNext, two-digit pages: 10-99. Here, the digits can be in the tens place or the ones place. Let me separate these. \n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers: The numbers from 40-49 have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's. \n\nFor the ones place in two-digit numbers: The numbers ending with 4 are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, but wait, 44 has a 4 in both places, so I think I've already counted the 4 in the tens place. So, I should count the ones place 4's as 9, but actually, since 44 is included, maybe it's 9 instances where the ones digit is 4. Wait, let me list them: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, so 9 4's in the ones place. But wait, 44 has two 4's, so when I count the tens place, I included the 4 in 44, and now in the ones place, I'm including the second 4. So, in total, for two-digit numbers, the 4's would be 10 (tens place) + 9 (ones place) = 19 4's. Wait, but 44 is counted twice, once in each place. So, that's correct because it has two 4's. So, 19 4's in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit pages: 100-488. This is a bit more complex. Let me break it down by hundreds, tens, and ones places.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: For three-digit numbers, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit goes from 1 to 4. But I'm only interested in when the hundreds digit is 4. So, numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's right there.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers: I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens digit across all three-digit numbers from 100-488. Let's consider each hundred separately: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nIn 100-199: The tens digit cycles from 0-9, so 4 appears in the tens place for 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\nSimilarly, in 200-299: The tens digit 4 appears in 240-249, another 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\nIn 300-399: The tens digit 4 appears in 340-349, another 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\nNow, in 400-488: The tens digit 4 appears in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 4's. However, wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is entirely within 400-488, so yes, 10 4's.\n\nSo, in the tens place across all three-digit numbers, that's 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the ones place in three-digit numbers: Similarly, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the ones place across all three-digit numbers from 100-488. Let's again break it down by hundreds.\n\nIn 100-199: The ones digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, for each ten, the ones digit 4 appears once. There are 10 tens (0-9), so 10 instances where the ones digit is 4, but wait, actually, for each hundred, there are 10 numbers where the ones digit is 4: 104,114,124,...,194. That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\nSimilarly, in 200-299: 204,214,...,294. That's another 10 4's.\n\nIn 300-399: 304,314,...,394. Another 10 4's.\n\nIn 400-488: Now, the ones digit 4 appears in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Wait, but 484 is within 488, so that's 9 numbers, right? Because 400-488 includes 404,414,...,484. Let me count: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 4's in the ones place for 400-488.\n\nSo, adding them up: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 4's in the ones place.\n\nWait, but 400-488: The ones digit 4 appears in 404,414,...,484, which is from 404 to 484, stepping by 10. So, how many terms? Let's see: (484 - 404)/10 + 1 = (80)/10 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9. So yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, in the ones place for three-digit numbers, 39 4's.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place 89 + tens place 40 + ones place 39 = 89 + 40 = 129, 129 + 39 = 168 4's.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, 89 in hundreds place, 40 in tens, 39 in ones: 89 + 40 = 129, plus 39 is 168. Hmm.\n\nNow, let's total all 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1 + 19 = 20, 20 + 168 = 188 4's.\n\nWait, that seems a lot, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the three-digit count.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred, 10 4's, so 4 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 isn't a full hundred; it's 89 numbers. So, in the tens place, for 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's correct. So, 10 in each hundred, so 4 times 10 is 40. That seems right.\n\nIn the ones place, for each hundred, 10 4's, except for the last one, which is 9. So, 10 +10 +10 +9 = 39. That adds up.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. Then, adding single and two-digit: 1 + 19 = 20, so total 4's: 20 + 168 = 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. Maybe I should do the same approach.\n\nStarting with single-digit pages: 1-9. Only page 8 has an 8, so that's 1.\n\nTwo-digit pages: 10-99.\n\nTens place: Numbers from 80-89 have 8 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\nOnes place: Numbers ending with 8: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, but 88 has two 8's, so in the ones place, we have 9 instances. But wait, 88 is counted in both tens and ones place. So, in the ones place, it's 9 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 19.\n\nNow, three-digit numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the hundreds digits are 1,2,3,4. So, no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: Let's check each hundred.\n\nIn 100-199: The tens digit 8 appears in 180-189. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\nIn 200-299: 280-289, another 10 8's.\n\nIn 300-399: 380-389, another 10 8's.\n\nIn 400-488: The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, but wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 8's in the tens place for 400-488.\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +9 = 39.\n\nNow, ones place in three-digit numbers:\n\nIn 100-199: The ones digit 8 appears in 108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\nIn 200-299: 208,218,...,298. 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\nIn 300-399: 308,318,...,398. 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\nIn 400-488: The ones digit 8 appears in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Let's count: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's in ones place: 10 +10 +10 +9 = 39.\n\nTherefore, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place 39 + ones place 39 = 78.\n\nAdding single-digit (1) and two-digit (19): 1 + 19 = 20, plus 78 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems off because 1 (single) +19 (two-digit) +78 (three-digit) = 98 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the three-digit count again. Tens place: 10+10+10+9=39, ones place:10+10+10+9=39. So, 39+39=78. Then, 1+19=20, so total 8's:20+78=98.\n\nSo, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts.\n\nWait, for the three-digit numbers, in the hundreds place, 4's:89, tens:40, ones:39. So, 89+40+39=168. Then, single and two-digit:1+19=20. So, 168+20=188 4's. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's: single-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:78. So, 1+19=20, 20+78=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm.\n\nWait, but let me check the three-digit 8's again. In the tens place, for 400-488, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. Similarly, in the ones place, 408,418,...,488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9+9=18 for 400-488 in both tens and ones. Then, for the other hundreds, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each contributes 10 in tens and 10 in ones, so 20 each. So, 3 hundreds *20=60, plus 18 from 400-488, totaling 78. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89, which is correct. Tens place: each hundred has 10, so 4 hundreds, 40. Ones place: each hundred has 10, except 400-488, which has 9, so 39. So, 89+40+39=168. Then, single and two-digit:20, so total 188.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a big difference. Let me check the counts again.\n\nWait, perhaps I overcounted the 4's in the three-digit numbers. Let me recount:\n\nThree-digit numbers:\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, 10 4's. So, 100-199:140-149 (10), 200-299:240-249 (10), 300-399:340-349 (10), 400-488:440-449 (10). So, 4*10=40.\n\nOnes place: For each hundred, 10 4's except the last one.\n\n100-199:104,114,...,194:10.\n\n200-299:204,...,294:10.\n\n300-399:304,...,394:10.\n\n400-488:404,414,...,484:9.\n\nSo, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1.\n\nTwo-digit: tens place 10 (80-89), ones place 9 (18,28,...,98 except 88 is counted twice, but in ones place, it's 9 numbers). So, 10+9=19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nTens place:100-199:180-189 (10), 200-299:280-289 (10), 300-399:380-389 (10), 400-488:480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nOnes place:100-199:108,118,...,198 (10), 200-299:208,...,298 (10), 300-399:308,...,398 (10), 400-488:408,418,...,488 (9). So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, 39+39=78.\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the three-digit ones place for 4's. Let me check again.\n\nIn 400-488, the ones digit 4 appears in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 4's. So, in the ones place, 10 (100-199) +10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+9=39. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, 400-488:440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\nSo, yes, 89+40+39=168.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and an extra 8 pages. So, in each complete set, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484). So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 pages. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but the last block is only up to 488, not 499. So, let me check: From 1-99, there's one block (40-49), then from 100-199 another (140-149), 200-299 another (240-249), and 300-399 another (340-349). Then, from 400-488, the block would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks in total, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but wait, from 400-488, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 4's would be units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units: 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4, plus one more in 481-488, so 49. Tens: Each hundred block contributes 10, and there are 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), so 5 * 10 = 50. Hundreds: From 400-488, 89 numbers. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. Again, considering units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once. So, in 488 pages, how many complete sets of 10? 48 complete sets (480 numbers), plus 8 extra pages (481-488). So, in each complete set, one 8, so 48. Then, in the extra 8 pages, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 pages. So, blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480 to 489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9 numbers. So, how many blocks? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9\n\nSo, total blocks: 5, but the last one has only 9 numbers. So, each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except the last one, which contributes 9. So, total 8's in tens place: 4 blocks * 10 + 1 block * 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check: From 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, yes, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800 onwards, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. For 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, right? So, 480 has 8 in the tens place, 481 has 8, up to 488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, yes, 9 occurrences. So, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, so 49 in tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 8's in tens place were 49, but let me recount. Wait, the first four blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, 40 +9=49. So, yes, 49 in tens place. Units place: 49, so total 98.\n\nNow, 4's total was 188, and 8's total is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting 4's. Let me recount the 4's in each place.\n\nUnits place: For 488 pages, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place: How many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's every 100 numbers, 10 times each. So, from 1-99: 40-49, that's 10. Then 100-199:140-149, another 10. 200-299:240-249, another 10. 300-399:340-349, another 10. 400-488:440-449, another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 +50 +89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's, units place: same logic, 48 full tens, each with one 8, so 48, plus in the last 8 numbers (481-488), units digit 8 appears once (488). So, 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: No 8's, as the book ends at 488, so no page numbers from 800-899.\n\nSo, total 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe I missed something. Let me check another way. Maybe I can write a small program or use another method to verify. Alternatively, maybe I can think of each digit place separately again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position and sum them up.\n\nWait, another approach: For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10)=48, plus if the last partial set has >=4, which it does (484 is in 481-488), so +1=49.\n\nNumber of 8's: floor(488/10)=48, plus if the last partial set has >=8, which it does (488), so +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)=4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, but wait, actually, for the tens digit, it's every 100 numbers, 10 occurrences. So, 488/100=4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place: 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 449 is less than 488, so 10 times. So, total 4's in tens place:40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place: floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (400-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nNumber of 8's: From 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can break this down by the number of digits in the page numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: 1-9. The digit 4 appears only once here, which is on page 4. So, that's one 4. Now, moving on to two-digit numbers: 10-99. In two-digit numbers, each digit can be considered separately. The tens place and the units place. Let me think about how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. \n\nIn the tens place: For two-digit numbers, the tens digit can range from 1 to 9. If the tens digit is 4, then the units digit can be anything from 0 to 9. So, that's 10 numbers: 40-49. Each of these has a 4 in the tens place, so that's 10 occurrences. \n\nIn the units place: For the units digit to be 4, the tens digit can be from 1 to 9, so that's 10 numbers: 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but 44 has a 4 in both tens and units place, so I think I should count each occurrence separately. So, that's 10 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, that's another 10 occurrences. \n\nBut wait, 44 was counted twice: once in the tens place and once in the units place. So, in total, for two-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 (tens) + 10 (units) = 20 times. \n\nWait, but when I think about page numbers, the two-digit numbers go up to 99, so that's correct. Now, moving on to three-digit numbers: 100-488. This is a bit more complex. Let's break it down into hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book only goes up to 488, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens and units digits are limited. Let me handle this carefully.\n\nHundreds place: When the hundreds digit is 4, the number is between 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, for the tens place in three-digit numbers: Let's consider all hundreds digits from 1 to 4, but for each, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to consider each digit place separately for three-digit numbers.\n\nSo, for three-digit numbers from 100 to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's break it down:\n\n1. Hundreds digit is 1: Numbers from 100 to 199. How many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit can be 0-9, so 4 appears once in each ten's group. So, from 140-149, that's 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place. Similarly, in the units place, for each hundred, 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, 104, 114, 124, ..., 194. That's 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me think again. For the tens place, when the hundreds digit is 1, the tens digit can be 0-9, so 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (140-149). Similarly, in the units place, for each tens digit, 4 appears once, so 10 times in total (104, 114, ..., 194).\n\nSimilarly, when the hundreds digit is 2, 3, or 4, the same applies, except when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens and units digits are limited beyond 488.\n\nWait, this might get complicated, so perhaps I should break it down more systematically.\n\nLet me think about each digit place separately for three-digit numbers.\n\nFirst, hundreds place: As I calculated earlier, when the hundreds digit is 4, it's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, tens place: For three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 0-9, and for each hundreds group, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place.\n\nFor hundreds digit 1: Numbers 100-199. The tens digit is 4 in 140-149, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digits 2, 3, and 4: Each will have 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. But wait, when hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can only go up to 8 because the book ends at 488. So, for hundreds digit 4, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, when the tens digit is 4, that's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, actually, for hundreds digit 4, the tens digit can be 0-8, so 4 appears in the tens place 10 times as well (440-449). So, in total, for the tens place in three-digit numbers, 4 appears 4 times 10, which is 40 times. Wait, no, because hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, so that's 4 hundreds groups, each contributing 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: For hundreds digit 1, 140-149: 10 times. Similarly, hundreds digit 2: 240-249: 10 times. Hundreds digit 3: 340-349: 10 times. Hundreds digit 4: 440-449: 10 times. So, yes, 40 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, units place: Similarly, for each hundreds group, the units digit cycles 0-9, so 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, for each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, etc.), the units digit 4 appears 10 times. Since there are 4 hundreds groups (1, 2, 3, 4), that's 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. For hundreds digit 1: 104, 114, 124, ..., 194: 10 numbers. Similarly for hundreds digits 2, 3, and 4. So, yes, 40 times in the units place.\n\nSo, for three-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times (from 400-488)\n- Tens place: 40 times\n- Units place: 40 times\n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me add them up: 89 + 40 + 40 = 169 times.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place. Because from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. Then, for the tens and units places, I considered each hundreds group separately, which seems okay.\n\nNow, let me check the total number of 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\nTwo-digit: 20\nThree-digit: 169\nTotal 4's: 1 + 20 + 169 = 190.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, the hundreds place is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Then, in the tens place, for each hundreds group (1, 2, 3, 4), the tens digit is 4 in 10 numbers each, so 4*10=40. Similarly, in the units place, 4 appears 10 times per hundreds group, so 4*10=40. So, 89+40+40=169 in three-digit numbers. Adding single-digit and two-digit: 1+20=21, so total 4's: 21+169=190. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. Maybe I can use a similar approach.\n\nSingle-digit page numbers: 1-9. The digit 8 appears once, on page 8.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: 10-99. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens and units places.\n\nTens place: When the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: For each tens digit from 1-9, the units digit is 8 once, so that's 9 occurrences (18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98). Wait, but 88 has an 8 in both tens and units place, so I need to count each occurrence separately. So, that's 10 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Wait, actually, from 10-99, the units digit is 8 for each ten, so that's 9 tens groups (1-9), each contributing one 8, so 9 times. Wait, but 88 is included in both the tens and units counts. So, for units place, it's 9 times, because 10-99 includes 10 tens groups? Wait, no, 10-99 has tens digits from 1-9, so 9 tens groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 9 occurrences. But wait, 88 is in the tens place as well, so in the units place, 88 is counted once. So, total units place 8's: 9.\n\nSimilarly, tens place 8's: 10 (80-89).\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nWait, but 88 has two 8's, so does that affect the count? Because when I count the tens place, I included 88, and when I count the units place, I included 88 as well. So, the total number of 8's in two-digit numbers would be 10 + 9 = 19, but 88 contributes two 8's, so the total should be 19. Let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place, so 10 8's. Then, in units place, 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98: that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 10 + 9 = 19, which includes 88 twice. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers: 100-488.\n\nAgain, let's break it down into hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's see how many times 8 appears in the hundreds place. Well, 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nTens place: Now, for three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 0-9, and we need to count how many times 8 appears in the tens place across all hundreds groups.\n\nFor each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit is 8 in the range X80-X89, where X is the hundreds digit. Let's calculate how many numbers are in each of these ranges.\n\n- For hundreds digit 1: 180-189: 10 numbers\n- For hundreds digit 2: 280-289: 10 numbers\n- For hundreds digit 3: 380-389: 10 numbers\n- For hundreds digit 4: 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, total occurrences in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nUnits place: Similarly, for each hundreds group, the units digit is 8 once every 10 numbers. Let's calculate how many times 8 appears in the units place.\n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, and 4, we can calculate how many times 8 appears in the units place.\n\n- For hundreds digit 1: 108, 118, 128, 138, 148, 158, 168, 178, 188, 198: 10 numbers\n- For hundreds digit 2: 208, 218, ..., 298: 10 numbers\n- For hundreds digit 3: 308, 318, ..., 398: 10 numbers\n- For hundreds digit 4: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488: 9 numbers (since 488 is included)\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so that's 9 numbers for hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, total units place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: For hundreds digit 1, from 100-199, the units digit 8 appears 10 times (108, 118, ..., 198). Similarly for 200-299 and 300-399. For 400-488, the units digit 8 appears from 408, 418, ..., 488. How many are there? Let's see: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers, as 488 is the last page. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, units place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nNow, adding up the 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\nTens place: 39\nUnits place: 39\nTotal: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. For the tens place, we had 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 9 (hundreds 4) = 39. For units place, same: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. So, total 78.\n\nNow, adding the single-digit and two-digit 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\nTwo-digit: 19\nThree-digit: 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me check again.\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 8)\nTwo-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\nThree-digit: 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any pages. For example, page 88 has two 8's, so it's counted once in the tens place and once in the units place, which is correct. Similarly, in three-digit numbers, pages like 188, 288, 388, 488 have two 8's each, so they are counted in both tens and units places, which is correct.\n\nNow, let's go back to the 4's. Earlier, I calculated 190 4's. Let me confirm that again.\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 4)\nTwo-digit: 10 (tens) + 10 (units) = 20\nThree-digit: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 40 (units) = 169\nTotal 4's: 1 + 20 + 169 = 190.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 190, and the number of 8's is 98. The question is asking how many more 4's are printed than 8's, so I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 190 - 98 = 92.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot, but let me check my calculations again to be sure.\n\nWait, for the 4's in the three-digit numbers, I had:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 (from 400-488)\n- Tens place: 40 (10 per hundreds group, 4 groups)\n- Units place: 40 (10 per hundreds group, 4 groups)\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 40 = 169.\n\nThen, single and two-digit: 1 + 20 = 21.\n\nTotal 4's: 169 + 21 = 190.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, 190 - 98 = 92.\n\nHmm, seems correct. So, the answer should be 92 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 190, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting, we get 190 - 98 = 92.\n\n$\\boxed{92}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Same for 8's. So, for the units place first. In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once. But wait, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, for each digit, the number of times it appears is 48 times once per block, plus any extra in the incomplete block. For 4, in the units place, in the incomplete block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484). Similarly, 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units place 4's: 48*1 +1=49. Units place 8's: 48*1 +1=49. Wait, that seems the same. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, no, because 488 is included, so the last number is 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, both 4 and 8 have 49 occurrences in the units place. Now, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). Now, how many complete hundreds do we have? The book has 488 pages, so that's 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, for each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 for 4's, and same for 8's. Now, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, in the 400's, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on. So, the digit 4 in the tens place would only appear in 440-449, which is 10 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So, that's another 10 occurrences for 4's in the tens place. What about 8's in the tens place? That would be 480-489, but since our book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the incomplete hundred. So, total tens place 4's: 4*10 +10=50. Tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. Hmm, so 4's have 50 in the tens place, and 8's have 49. Now, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, which doesn't count. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (400-488 inclusive). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. How about 8's in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times. So, total hundreds place 4's:89, and 8's:0. Now, let me sum up the counts for each digit place. For 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 4 appears 188 times. For 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Therefore, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each digit place again. Units place: For 4's, from 1-488, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. There are 48 complete decades (1-10, 11-20,...481-490), but wait, 488 is the last page, so the last complete decade is 481-490, but 490 is beyond 488, so actually, it's 48 complete decades (1-480), and then 481-488. So, 48*1=48, plus in 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total units place 4's:49. Similarly, units place 8's:48*1=48, plus in 481-488, 8 appears once (488). So, 49 units place 8's. So that's correct. Tens place: For 4's, in each hundred, 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 times per hundred. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, 40+10=50. For 8's in the tens place: each hundred has 80-89, which is 10 times. So, 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...488). So, 40+9=49. So, that's correct. Hundreds place: 4's appear from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. 8's never appear in the hundreds place, so 0. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. Total 8's:49+49+0=98. Difference:188-98=90. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each block of 10 numbers contains one 4. There are 48 complete blocks (1-480) contributing 48 occurrences. In 481-488, 4 appears once (484). Total: 49.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, each block has one 8. 48 blocks contribute 48, plus one in 488. Total: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each hundred contains 10 occurrences (40-49). Four complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 40. In 401-488, 440-449 adds 10. Total: 50.\n   - **8's:** Each hundred has 10 occurrences (80-89). Four hundreds contribute 40. In 401-488, 480-488 adds 9. Total: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n   - **8's:** The hundreds digit never reaches 8.\n\nSumming up:\n- **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. \n\nFirst, for the units place: How many times does 4 appear in the units digit from 1 to 488? Well, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such sets are there? Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That would be 48 times. But wait, the last set goes up to 488, so does 488 include another 4 in the units place? 488 ends with an 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484, which is within the 480-489 range. So, yes, that's 48 times. But wait, from 1 to 488, the first set is 1-10, which includes 4. The last set would be 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the 488th page is included, but 488 doesn't end with a 4. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48. \n\nNext, the tens place: How many times does 4 appear in the tens digit? In the tens place, 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, specifically from x40 to x49, where x can be 0,1,2,3,4. Wait, but page numbers start at 1, so the first block where the tens digit is 4 is from 40 to 49. Then, the next block would be 140 to 149, then 240 to 249, 340 to 349, and 440 to 449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so that's 5*10=50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 1-488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. \n\nNow, the hundreds place: How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds digit? The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 occurrences of the digit 4 in the hundreds place. \n\nWait, but let me check that. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, yes, 89 times. \n\nSo, adding up the 4's in each place: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 4's in total. \n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. \n\nStarting with the units place: How many times does 8 appear in the units digit? Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many such sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. So, 48 times. But wait, does the last set (481-490) include 488, which ends with an 8? Yes, 488 is included, so that's one more 8. So, total units place 8's would be 48 +1=49. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The first set is 1-10, which includes 8. Then 11-20 includes 18, and so on. The last set is 481-490, which includes 488. So, in each of the 49 sets (since 488 is the 49th set?), wait, no, 488 is the 49th set because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets and a partial set. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (sets of 10) plus one if the last number is >= the next multiple of 10. So, from 1 to 488, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48 times, plus 1 if the last digit is >=8. Wait, 488 mod 10 is 8, which is equal to 8, so we add 1. So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49. \n\nOkay, so units place: 49 8's. \n\nNow, tens place: How many times does 8 appear in the tens digit? Similar to the 4's, it's in blocks of 100. The blocks where the tens digit is 8 are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. \n\nSo, let's count each block: \n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. \n- 180-189: another 10. \n- 280-289: another 10. \n- 380-389: another 10. \n- 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 8's in the tens place. \n\nWait, is that right? From 480 to 488, inclusive, that's 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, 9 8's in the tens place for the last block. \n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. \n\nWait, let me check: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) give 4*10=40, plus the last block (480-488) gives 9, so 40+9=49. \n\nOkay, so tens place: 49 8's. \n\nNow, hundreds place: How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds digit? The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place. \n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total 98 8's. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place was 49 and tens place 49, so 98 total 8's. \n\nNow, the number of 4's was 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 -98=89. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's. \n\nWait, for the 4's: units place was 48, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. 48+50=98, +89=187. That seems correct. \n\nFor the 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. 49+49=98. \n\nSo, 187-98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. \n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place for 4's. I said 48, but let me check: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? The last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10 =484. So, n-1=(484-4)/10=480/10=48, so n=49. Wait, that's 49 times. But earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, I might have made a mistake there. \n\nWait, let me clarify. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of numbers from 1 to 488 that end with 4. The first is 4, then 14,24,...,484. How many terms? The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 4 +10(n-1)=484. So, 10(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48. That was a mistake. So, units place for 4's is 49, not 48. So, that changes things. \n\nSo, let me recalculate the 4's. \n\nUnits place: 49. \n\nTens place: earlier I thought 50. Let me check that again. \n\nTens place: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5*10=50. \n\nHundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89. \n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)= 49+50=99, 99+89=188. \n\nWait, so earlier I had 187, but now it's 188. That's because I corrected the units place from 48 to 49. \n\nNow, for the 8's, let's see. Units place: I thought it was 49, but let me check again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many terms. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 +10(n-1)=488. 10(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times. \n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. \n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. \n\nSo, now, 4's total:188, 8's total:98. \n\nDifference:188-98=90. \n\nWait, so earlier I thought 89, but now it's 90. Because I corrected the units place for 4's from 48 to 49, which added 1 to the total 4's, making it 188 instead of 187. \n\nSo, the correct difference is 90. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any other mistakes. \n\nLet me recount the 4's: \n\nUnits place:49 \n\nTens place:50 \n\nHundreds place:89 \n\nTotal:49+50=99 +89=188. \n\n8's: \n\nUnits:49 \n\nTens:49 \n\nTotal:98 \n\nDifference:188-98=90. \n\nYes, that seems correct. \n\nI think the mistake earlier was undercounting the units place for 4's. It should be 49, not 48, because 484 is the last one, which is the 49th term. So, the correct difference is 90. \n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place for 4's. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? Let's calculate: \n\nThe number of terms is equal to the floor division of 488 by 10, which is 48, but since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is less than 4, we don't add 1. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the formula is floor((n - a)/d) +1, where a is the first term, d is the common difference. \n\nHere, a=4, d=10, n=488. So, the number of terms is floor((488 -4)/10)+1 = floor(484/10)+1=48+1=49. So, yes, 49 terms. So, units place for 4's is 49. \n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place, same calculation: a=8, d=10, n=488. So, floor((488-8)/10)+1= floor(480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 terms. \n\nOkay, so that's correct. \n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers (since 484 is the 49th occurrence).\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449). Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   \n   Total '4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488). Each block contributes 10 occurrences except the last, which contributes 9. Totaling 49.\n   \n   Total '8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - More '4's than '8's = 188 (total '4's) - 98 (total '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, for the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, in this partial group, does 4 appear in the units place? Yes, at 484. So that's one more time. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each group of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many such groups are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete groups (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these groups contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit is 4 from 400-409, but wait, our remaining numbers start at 401. Wait, actually, 400-409 would be part of the 400 group, which I've already counted in the 4th group. So from 400-488, the tens digit is 0 in 400-409, then 1 in 410-419, and so on up to 8 in 480-488. Wait, no, actually, the tens digit in 400-409 is 0, right? Because 400 is 4 0 0, 401 is 4 0 1, etc. So from 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So in the tens place, 4 appears only once in the 400-409 range, but since we're starting at 401, that's already included in the 4th group. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's every 100 numbers, 10 times each. So 4 complete hundreds give 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So 4 appears once in the tens place at 440-449. Wait, no, 440-449 would have the tens digit as 4, but 440 is part of the 400-499 range, which is the 4th group. Wait, but 488 is less than 499, so the 4th group goes up to 488. So in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear in 400-488? It's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. But wait, 488 is less than 499, so does that affect it? No, because 440-449 is within 400-488. So actually, in the 4th group, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449). So that's an additional 10, making the total tens place 4's 40 +10=50. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 40, but now I'm adding 10 more. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me clarify. From 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49: 10 numbers. Similarly, 101-200: 140-149: 10. 201-300: 240-249:10. 301-400: 340-349:10. So that's 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449: another 10. So total tens place 4's: 40+10=50.\n\nWait, but 488 is less than 499, so 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, 10 more. So total tens place 4's:50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, but wait, 400 is the first page with hundreds digit 4, and 488 is the last. So from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 4's.\n\nNow, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So 188 4's.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Okay.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with units place. Similar to 4's, in each group of 10, 8 appears once in the units place. From 1-488, how many complete groups of 10? 48 complete groups (1-480), each contributing 1 8, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So total units place 8's: 48+1=49.\n\nTens place. In each group of 100, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers. How many complete groups of 100? 4 complete groups (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial group 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times. So total tens place 8's:40+9=49.\n\nWait, let me check that. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So 9 more, making it 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So the hundreds digit is never 8. So hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, so 4's are 188, 8's are 98. So the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, for the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Units place: 49, tens place:50. 49+50=99, plus 89=188. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, so 98 total. So 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So 40+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the units place for 8's again. From 1-480, 48 groups of 10, each contributing 1 8, so 48. Then 481-488 has 8 at 488, so 1 more, total 49. Correct.\n\nSo yes, 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for 4's. Let me recount. From 400-488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488-400+1=89. So 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89 4's. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place in 4's, from 40-49, 140-149, etc., each group of 100 contributes 10 4's in the tens place. 4 groups, so 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, making 50. Correct.\n\nSo I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every group of 10 numbers contributes 1 '4' in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10 in 488, contributing 48 '4's.\n   - In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), '4' appears once (at 484).\n   - Total units place '4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every group of 100 numbers contributes 10 '4's in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).\n   - There are 4 complete groups of 100, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 '4's.\n   - In the last partial group (401-488), '4' appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (440-449).\n   - Total tens place '4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - From page 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is '4' for 89 numbers.\n   - Total hundreds place '4's: 89.\n\n**Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every group of 10 numbers contributes 1 '8' in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10, contributing 48 '8's.\n   - In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), '8' appears once (at 488).\n   - Total units place '8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every group of 100 numbers contributes 10 '8's in the tens place (e.g., 80-89).\n   - There are 4 complete groups of 100, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 '8's.\n   - In the last partial group (401-488), '8' appears in the tens place for 9 numbers (480-488).\n   - Total tens place '8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is '8' only in pages 800-899, which are beyond the book's range.\n   - Total hundreds place '8's: 0.\n\n**Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4. That gives 48 fours. But wait, the last partial set from 481 to 488 includes 484, which is another 4 in the units place. So, that's 49 fours in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, in every block of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. Let's see how many such blocks there are in 488. From 1 to 488, there are four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens place has 10 fours. That's 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So, total fours in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 401-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these 89 numbers, contributing 89 fours. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought about hundreds place only up to 488. Let me confirm. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188.\n\nHmm, wait, did I count correctly? Let me double-check. Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units. 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens and then 8 extra numbers. So, 48 fours plus one more in 484, making 49. That's correct. Tens place: in each hundred, 10 fours. There are five hundreds in 488 (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, no, 488 is less than 500, so actually, the hundreds are 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, five hundreds, but the first hundred (0-99) doesn't have a hundreds digit, so only the tens place in the first hundred. Wait, no, the hundreds digit is zero in the first hundred, so the tens digit in the first hundred is as usual. So, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, for 0-99, 40-49: 10 fours. For 100-199, 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10 more. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. Then, 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 fours. So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. That seems correct. And the hundreds place: only in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll use the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: similar to 4's. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. Then, in the last partial ten, 481-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8. So, total units place eights: 48 +1 =49.\n\nTens place: In each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers. So, in 0-99: 80-89, 10 eights. Similarly, 100-199: 180-189, another 10. 200-299: 280-289, 10 more. 300-399: 380-389, another 10. 400-488: Now, here, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480, 481, ..., 488. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for this last partial hundred. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 0-399) plus 9 in 400-488. So, 4*10=40 +9=49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. So, that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so 9 eights. So, yes, 40 +9=49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, in the tens place, 4 sets of 10 (from 0-399) plus 9, making 49. So, that seems correct.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me just make sure I didn't double-count or miss anything.\n\nWait, 188 fours and 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. Then, in the tens place, 50 fours, and units place 49 fours. So, 89+50=139+49=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor eights, units place: 49, tens place:49, so 98 total. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me think again. In the hundreds place, for fours, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Then, in the tens place, 50 fours, and units place 49. So, 89+50=139, 139+49=188. Correct.\n\nFor eights, units place: every 10 numbers, so 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, each with one 8, plus the last partial ten, which includes 488, so 48+1=49 eights in units.\n\nIn the tens place: in each hundred, 10 eights, so 4 hundreds (0-399) give 4*10=40, and in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40+9=49.\n\nSo, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.\n\nHmm, I think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, for the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4, 14, 24, etc. So, I can calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, that means there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 fours. But wait, in the last partial group, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 would have a 4 in the units place. So, that adds one more 4, making it 49 fours in the units place. \n\nNext, the tens place. In the tens place, 4 appears in every block of 100 numbers, specifically in the 40-49 range. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 40-49, that's 10 times. Then, this repeats every 100 numbers. So, in 1-100, 10 times; 101-200, another 10 times; 201-300, another 10 times; 301-400, another 10 times; and 401-488, another 10 times? Wait, but 401-488 is only 88 numbers, so the tens digit in 401-488 would go from 0 to 8, but the 4 in the tens place would only be from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so the last block is 401-488. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. \n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. \n\nAdding up the fours in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. \n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. \n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, and then in the last partial group (481-488), 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's 48+1=49 eights in the units place. \n\nNext, the tens place. 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, that's 4 ranges, each with 10 eights, totaling 4*10=40 eights. \n\nWhat about the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. \n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (40) = 89 eights in total. \n\nNow, subtracting the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 89 = 99. \n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. \n\nFor fours: units place: from 1-488, how many numbers end with 4? It's 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490), but 488 is less than 490, so the last group is 481-488, which includes 484, so 48 full groups (each contributing 1) +1=49. \n\nTens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. \n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. \n\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188. \n\nFor eights: units place: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and the last partial group includes 488, so 48+1=49. \n\nTens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each is 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. \n\nHundreds place: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488. \n\nTotal eights: 49+40=89. \n\nSo, 188 fours minus 89 eights equals 99. \n\nWait, but 188-89 is indeed 99. So, there are 99 more fours than eights. \n\nBut let me make sure I didn't miss any numbers. For example, in the hundreds place for fours, 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. And in the tens place, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. \n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 99 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10, contributing 48 fours. The last partial group (481-488) includes 484, adding 1 more. Total: 49 fours.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 fours, totaling 50 fours.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Total: 89 fours.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10, contributing 48 eights. The last partial group (481-488) includes 488, adding 1 more. Total: 49 eights.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, and 380-389. Each range contributes 10 eights, totaling 40 eights.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488. Total: 0 eights.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 40 = 89.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 89 (8's) = 99.\n\n$\\boxed{99}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Similarly for 8's. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears once. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 fours. But wait, the last set is from 481-490, but our book ends at 488, so the last set isn't complete. So, actually, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so the digit 4 appears once in 484. So, that adds one more 4 in the units place, making it 48 + 1 = 49 fours in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, the digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, from 101-200, the tens digit is 4 in 140-149, another 10 times. So, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Now, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but in our case, we go up to 488, so 440-449 is fully included. So, that's another 10 fours in the tens place. So, total fours in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Because from 401-488, the hundreds digit is 4, but the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. So, yes, that's 10 more fours. So, tens place gives 50 fours.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. Starting with the units place. Similar to the fours, in each set of 10, the digit 8 appears once. So, from 1-488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. But again, the last set is 481-490, but our book ends at 488, so the units digit in the last partial set is 8 at 488. So, that adds one more 8, making it 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 8 appears in sets like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each of these contributes 10 eights. So, how many complete hundreds are there? 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds. Each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40 eights. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in the tens place would be 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 9 eights. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights in total.\n\nWait, but hold on, when I counted the units place, I included 488, which is correct. And in the tens place, I included 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, total eights are 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, for fours, I had 188 fours, and eights are 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount the fours. Units place: 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit is 4 at 484, so that's 1 more, making 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) each have 10 fours, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 more, making 50. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor eights: Units place: 48 complete sets, 48 eights, plus one more at 488, making 49. Tens place: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 eights, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check again for the eights in the tens place. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, that's five sets, each contributing 10 eights except the last one, which contributes 9. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, so 4*10 +9=49. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for fours in the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 and one set of 10 (440-449), so 5*10=50. So, that's correct.\n\nAnd in the hundreds place, fours have 89, eights have 0. So, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks of 10 in 488 pages, contributing 48 fours.\n   - The last partial block (481-488) includes 484, adding 1 more.\n   - **Total in units place:** 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In every block of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).\n   - There are 4 complete blocks of 100, contributing 40 fours.\n   - The remaining pages (401-488) include 440-449, adding 10 more.\n   - **Total in tens place:** 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 fours.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188 fours**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, there are 48 complete blocks of 10, contributing 48 eights.\n   - The last partial block includes 488, adding 1 more.\n   - **Total in units place:** 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In every block of 100, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89).\n   - There are 4 complete blocks, contributing 40 eights.\n   - The remaining pages include 480-488, contributing 9 eights.\n   - **Total in tens place:** 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98 eights**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 fours - 98 eights = **90 more fours**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Similarly for the digit 8. \n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. Units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many such sets are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, in each of the 48 full sets, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So total for units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but wait, when I think about the last set, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So yes, 4 appears once. So units place total is 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, how about the tens place? The digit 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 instances of 4 in the tens place. So 5 * 10 = 50 times.\n\nBut wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's correct.\n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these 89 numbers. So 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So yes, 89 times.\n\nSo adding up the occurrences of 4 in each place:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 8:\n\n1. Units place: Similar to 4, in every set of ten numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many sets of ten are there? 48 full sets (1-480) and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, in each of the 48 sets, 8 appears once, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more. So total for units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but 481-488 includes 488, whose units digit is 8, so yes, that's correct.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, the digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but 480-489 would be up to 489, but our book only goes up to 488. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So each of these blocks contributes 10 instances except the last one, which contributes 9. So let's count:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers\n\nSo total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, let me check that. 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So yes, 10*4 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So zero times.\n\nSo adding up the occurrences of 8 in each place:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems a bit low. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, when counting the tens place for 8, I considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. Let me confirm how many numbers are in each block:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So yes, correct.\n\nSo total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but wait a minute, let me check the hundreds place again. Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so that's correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So that would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49 times.\n\nTens place: 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\nHundreds place: 89 times.\n\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49 times.\n\nTens place: 49 times.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal: 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So yes, 89 times. So that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's the same as the number of pages from 400 to 488, which is 89. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, in the tens place, I had 49. Let me recount that. Each block of 100 has one block where the tens digit is 8, which is 10 numbers. So up to 400, that's 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10. Then from 480-488, that's 9 numbers. So 4*10 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check another way. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? For each hundred, the 80-89 range contributes 10. So:\n\n- 1-99: 80-89 \u2192 10\n- 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10\n- 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10\n- 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10\n- 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9\n\nSo total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, units place for 8: in each set of ten, 8 appears once. So from 1-480, that's 48 sets, each contributing 1, so 48. Then from 481-488, units digits go from 1-8, so 8 appears once. So total 49. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot, but considering the range up to 488, maybe it's correct. Let me think of a smaller example to test my method.\n\nFor example, let's say we have a 20-page book. How many 4's and 8's?\n\nPage numbers 1-20.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\nUnits place: 4,14 \u2192 2 times.\n\nTens place: 40-49, but since we only go up to 20, none. So 0.\n\nHundreds place: none.\n\nTotal 4's: 2.\n\nCounting 8's:\n\nUnits place: 8,18 \u2192 2 times.\n\nTens place: 80-89, but only up to 20, so none.\n\nHundreds place: none.\n\nTotal 8's: 2.\n\nDifference: 2 - 2 = 0.\n\nWait, that's correct because in 1-20, 4 and 8 appear twice each.\n\nAnother test: 80-page book.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\nUnits place: 4,14,24,34,44 \u2192 5 times.\n\nTens place: 40-49 \u2192 10 times.\n\nHundreds place: none.\n\nTotal 4's: 5 + 10 = 15.\n\nCounting 8's:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,28,38,48,58,68,78 \u2192 8 times.\n\nTens place: 80-89 \u2192 10 times.\n\nHundreds place: none.\n\nTotal 8's: 8 + 10 = 18.\n\nDifference: 15 - 18 = -3. So 8's appear 3 more times than 4's. Hmm, that seems correct because in the 80-89 range, 8 appears more.\n\nWait, but in this case, 4's are less than 8's. So my method seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, 4's are more than 8's by 90. That seems plausible.\n\nWait, another test: 488 pages. Let me see if the hundreds place for 4's is correctly 89. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So yes, 89 times. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, in the tens place, we have 49 times, which includes 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   In every block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once.  \n   - From 1 to 480: 48 blocks \u2192 48 times.  \n   - From 481 to 488: 4 appears once.  \n   **Total:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   In every block of 100 numbers, 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149).  \n   - From 1 to 488: 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   **Total:** 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4.  \n   - Number of pages: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.  \n   **Total:** 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   Similar to 4, in every block of 10 numbers, 8 appears once.  \n   - From 1 to 480: 48 blocks \u2192 48 times.  \n   - From 481 to 488: 8 appears once.  \n   **Total:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   In every block of 100 numbers, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189).  \n   - From 1 to 488: 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) \u2192 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.  \n   - From 480 to 488: 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8.  \n   **Total:** 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   **Total:** 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."
