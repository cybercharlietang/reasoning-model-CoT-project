    "text": " \n\nFirst, let's consider the single-digit page numbers: 1 to 9. The digit 4 appears once here, which is on page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence. \n\nNext, the two-digit page numbers: 10 to 99. Here, the digit 4 can appear in the tens place or the units place. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers are 40-49. That's 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place. So that's 10 occurrences. \n\nFor the units place: The numbers are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, each with a 4 in the units place. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, right? So, I need to make sure I'm counting correctly. When I count the tens place, I included 44 as having a 4 in the tens place, and when I count the units place, I included 44 again as having a 4 in the units place. So, in total, 44 contributes two 4's. So, for the units place, it's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4, but 44 is already counted in the tens place. Wait, no, actually, when I count the units place separately, I'm just counting how many times 4 appears in the units place, regardless of the tens digit. So, 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94 \u2013 that's 9 occurrences. So, in the two-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 times. But wait, 44 is included in both counts, so does that mean I'm double-counting? Hmm, no, because when I count the tens place, I'm counting how many times 4 is in the tens digit, and when I count the units place, I'm counting how many times 4 is in the units digit. So, 44 is counted twice because it has two 4's. So, that's correct. So, 10 + 9 = 19 occurrences of 4 in the two-digit numbers. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 10 to 99, the tens digits go from 1 to 9, and the units digits go from 0 to 9. So, for the tens place, each digit from 1 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 10 times (40-49). For the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 9 times in the units place (since the tens digit goes from 1 to 9). So, 4 in the units place appears 9 times. So, total 10 + 9 = 19 times. That seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the three-digit page numbers: 100 to 488. Here, the digit 4 can appear in the hundreds place, tens place, or units place. \n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\nFor the hundreds place: When the hundreds digit is 4, the numbers are from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. \n\nNext, the tens place: We need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488. \n\nThe tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), we can count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. \n\nIn 100-199: The tens digit is 4 for numbers 140-149, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 occurrences. \n\nIn 200-299: Similarly, 240-249, another 10 occurrences. \n\nIn 300-399: 340-349, another 10 occurrences. \n\nIn 400-488: The tens digit is 4 for numbers 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. \n\nSo, total for the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 occurrences. \n\nWait, but let me check: 100-199: 140-149 (10), 200-299: 240-249 (10), 300-399: 340-349 (10), 400-488: 440-449 (10). So, yes, 40 times. \n\nNow, the units place: How many times does 4 appear in the units place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488. \n\nAgain, for each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, in each hundred, 4 appears once in the units place for each ten. \n\nFrom 100-199: The units digit is 4 for 104, 114, 124, 134, 144, 154, 164, 174, 184, 194. That's 10 numbers. \n\nSimilarly, in 200-299: 204, 214, ..., 294: 10 numbers. \n\nIn 300-399: 304, 314, ..., 394: 10 numbers. \n\nIn 400-488: The units digit is 4 for 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488, so we stop at 484. So, how many is that? Let's count: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the ninth occurrence. Wait, no, from 404 to 484, each 10 numbers, so 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484: that's 9 numbers because 484 is the ninth one. Wait, but 400-488: The units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, from 400 to 488, how many times does the units digit 4 appear? \n\nThe first number with units digit 4 is 404, then every 10 numbers: 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. So, that's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 494, which is beyond 488. So, 9 occurrences. \n\nSo, total units place 4's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 occurrences. \n\nSo, for the three-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears: hundreds place 89 times, tens place 40 times, units place 39 times. So total 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 times. \n\nWait, let me add that again: 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. So, 168 occurrences of 4 in three-digit numbers. \n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1 + 19 = 20, 20 + 168 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. \n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: 1-9. The digit 8 appears once, on page 8. So, 1 occurrence. \n\nTwo-digit page numbers: 10-99. \n\nTens place: The numbers 80-89 have 8 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. \n\nUnits place: The numbers are 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the units place. But 88 has two 8's, so when counting units place, we include it once. So, 9 occurrences. \n\nSo, total in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 occurrences. \n\nWait, but let me check: For the tens place, 80-89 is 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. For the units place, from 10-99, the units digit 8 appears in 18,28,...,98, which is 9 numbers because the tens digit goes from 1 to 9, so 9 occurrences. So, 10 + 9 = 19. \n\nNow, three-digit page numbers: 100-488. \n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the hundreds digit is 8, but since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3, 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. \n\nTens place: Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place from 100-488. \n\nFor each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles 0-9. \n\nIn 100-199: The tens digit is 8 for 180-189, which is 10 numbers. \n\nIn 200-299: 280-289, another 10 numbers. \n\nIn 300-399: 380-389, another 10 numbers. \n\nIn 400-488: The tens digit is 8 for 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here. \n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 occurrences. \n\nUnits place: How many times does 8 appear in the units place from 100-488. \n\nFor each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. \n\nIn 100-199: The units digit is 8 for 108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198. That's 10 numbers. \n\nIn 200-299: 208,218,...,298: 10 numbers. \n\nIn 300-399: 308,318,...,398: 10 numbers. \n\nIn 400-488: The units digit is 8 for 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included, but 498 would be beyond 488. So, 9 occurrences. \n\nSo, total units place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 occurrences. \n\nTherefore, in three-digit numbers, the digit 8 appears: tens place 39 times, units place 39 times. So, total 39 + 39 = 78 times. \n\nNow, adding up all the 8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) = 1 + 19 = 20, 20 + 78 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. Single-digit: 1, two-digit:19, three-digit:78. 1+19=20, 20+78=98. Yes, that's correct. \n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's: 188, total 8's:98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each part again quickly. \n\nFor 4's: single-digit 1, two-digit 19, three-digit 168. 1+19=20, 20+168=188. \n\nFor 8's: single-digit 1, two-digit 19, three-digit 78. 1+19=20, 20+78=98. \n\n188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. \n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any errors in the calculations. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I'll consider single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears exactly once, which is on page 4. So, single-digit pages contribute 1 to the count of 4's.\n\nNext, I'll move on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I'll need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place.\n\nFor the tens place: The tens digit is 4 for numbers from 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nFor the units place: The units digit is 4 in numbers like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, but wait, from 10 to 99, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let me think. From 10-99, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 9 times in the units place, but since we're starting from 10, maybe it's 9 times. Wait, no, actually, from 10 to 99, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 such groups (10-19 up to 90-99), so that's 9 times. But wait, 44 has 4 in both tens and units, but I'm only counting the units place here, so 44 is included in the units count. So, the units place contributes 9 times. Therefore, in two-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me check that again. From 10-99, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For the units digit, in each ten's group, the units digit cycles 0-9, so in 10-19, units digit 4 is at 14, in 20-29 at 24, and so on up to 90-99 at 94. That's 9 times, right? Because from 10-99, there are 9 ten's groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, yes, 9 times. So total 10 + 9 = 19 times in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. These have hundreds, tens, and units places. I need to count the number of times 4 appears in each place.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. However, when the hundreds digit is 4, the numbers go up to 488, not 499. So, I need to handle the hundreds place carefully.\n\nFor the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place: Here, I need to consider each hundred's group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) and count how many times 4 appears in the tens digit.\n\nFor each hundred's group, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each group, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. Let's see:\n\n- 100-199: The tens digit is 4 for 140-149, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times.\n- 200-299: Similarly, 240-249, 10 times.\n- 300-399: 340-349, 10 times.\n- 400-488: Here, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 times.\n\nSo, for each hundred's group, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and there are 4 hundred's groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). So, 4 groups \u00d7 10 = 40 times. But wait, in the 400-488 group, the tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, total 40 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the units place: Similarly, in each hundred's group, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each group, the units digit is 4 for 10 numbers. Let's check each hundred's group:\n\n- 100-199: The units digit is 4 for 104, 114, 124, ..., 194. That's 10 times.\n- 200-299: Similarly, 204, 214, ..., 294. 10 times.\n- 300-399: 304, 314, ..., 394. 10 times.\n- 400-488: Here, the units digit is 4 for 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, how many is that? From 404 to 484, stepping by 10, that's (484 - 404)/10 + 1 = (80)/10 +1=8+1=9 times. Wait, but 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Yes, that's 9 numbers. So, in the 400-488 group, the units digit 4 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, for the units place, in the first three hundred's groups (100-399), each contributes 10 times, so 3\u00d710=30. Then, the 400-488 group contributes 9 times. So, total units digit 4's are 30 +9=39 times.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each has 10 numbers where the units digit is 4, so 3\u00d710=30. Then, 400-488: the units digit 4 appears at 404,414,...,484. Let's count: 404 is the first, then 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers. So, 30+9=39.\n\nSo, in the units place, 39 times.\n\nWait, but hold on, is 484 within 400-488? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, adding up the hundreds, tens, and units places for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\n- Tens place: 40 times\n- Units place: 39 times\n\nTotal 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, let me check that addition: 89 +40=129, 129+39=168. Yes.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit:168\nTotal 4's: 1 +19=20, 20+168=188.\n\nSo, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, I need to count the number of times 8 appears. Let's do the same process.\n\nFirst, single-digit page numbers (1-9): The digit 8 appears once, on page 8.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers (10-99):\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 for numbers from 80 to 89, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times.\n\nUnits place: In each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, ...,90-99), the units digit is 8 once. There are 9 ten's groups, so 9 times. But wait, from 10-99, the units digit 8 appears in 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, 8's count is 10 (tens) +9 (units)=19 times.\n\nThree-digit page numbers (100-488):\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8? Wait, no, the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place in any three-digit page number here, since the book only goes up to 488. So, hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nTens place: Let's check each hundred's group.\n\n- 100-199: Tens digit 8 is from 180-189, which is 10 numbers.\n- 200-299: 280-289, 10 numbers.\n- 300-399: 380-389, 10 numbers.\n- 400-488: Here, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the 400-488 group, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\n- 100-199:10\n- 200-299:10\n- 300-399:10\n- 400-488:9\nTotal: 10+10+10+9=39 times.\n\nUnits place: In each hundred's group, the units digit is 8 once per ten's group.\n\n- 100-199: 108,118,128,...,198. That's 10 numbers.\n- 200-299: 208,218,...,298. 10 numbers.\n- 300-399: 308,318,...,398. 10 numbers.\n- 400-488: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers.\n\nSo, units digit 8's:\n\n- 100-199:10\n- 200-299:10\n- 300-399:10\n- 400-488:9\nTotal: 10+10+10+9=39 times.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, the digit 8 appears:\n\n- Tens place:39\n- Units place:39\nTotal:39+39=78 times.\n\nAdding up all the 8's:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit:78\nTotal 8's:1+19=20, 20+78=98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Single-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:78. 1+19=20, 20+78=98. Yes, 98 times.\n\nWait, but hold on, in the three-digit numbers, the hundreds place didn't contribute any 8's, which is correct because the hundreds digits go up to 4. So, yes, 78 times in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, total 4's:188, total 8's:98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me go through the counts again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1 (page 4)\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place:40-49 (10 numbers)\n- Units place:14,24,...,94 (9 numbers)\nTotal:19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds place:400-488 (89 numbers)\n- Tens place:40-49 in each hundred group, so 10 each for 100-199,200-299,300-399, and 10 for 400-488 (but wait, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 10 each for all four hundred groups)\n- Units place:104,114,...,194 (10), 204,...,294 (10), 304,...,394 (10), and 404,414,...,484 (9)\nSo, units place:10+10+10+9=39\n\nSo, three-digit 4's:89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units)=168\n\nTotal 4's:1+19+168=188\n\nFor 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1 (page8)\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place:80-89 (10)\n- Units place:18,28,...,98 (9)\nTotal:19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Tens place:180-189,280-289,380-389 (each 10, so 30) and 480-488 (9)\nTotal tens:39\n\n- Units place:108,118,...,198 (10), 208,...,298 (10),308,...,398 (10),408,...,488 (9)\nTotal units:39\n\nTotal three-digit 8's:39+39=78\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the three-digit counts again, especially for the 4's units place. From 100-399, each hundred group has 10 units digit 4's, so 3\u00d710=30. Then, 400-488: units digit 4's are at 404,414,...,484. Let's count: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, so 9. So, total 30+9=39. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's units place in 400-488: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the counts seem accurate. Therefore, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. Since the book goes up to 488, I need to find out how many complete sets of ten there are and then check if there's a partial set at the end. \n\nLet me calculate the number of complete tens: 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers. Each complete set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, page 484 will have a 4 in the units place. That's one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten numbers. For example, 40-49 all have 4 in the tens place. So, each such block contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? So that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nAdding all the 4's together: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, each set of ten numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so page 488 has an 8 in the units place. That's one more. So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me check if 480-489 is included, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, not a full block. So, each full block contributes 10 8's, and the last partial block contributes 9 8's? Wait, no. Wait, in the tens place, 480-488: the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, right? Because 480 is 4 8 0, 481 is 4 8 1, up to 488, which is 4 8 8. So, the tens digit is 8 for all these 9 numbers. So, each full block (like 80-89) has 10 8's in the tens place, and the last partial block (480-488) has 9 8's in the tens place. So, how many full blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four blocks, each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Then, the last block from 480-488 contributes 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full tens + 1 = 49\n- Tens: 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449) each contributing 10, so 5*10=50\n- Hundreds: 89 numbers from 400-488, so 89\nTotal: 49+50+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full tens +1=49\n- Tens: 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each 10, so 4*10=40; plus 480-488 which is 9, so 40+9=49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nDifference: 188-98=90\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the 4's:**\n- **Units place:** Each set of ten numbers contributes one 4. There are 48 complete sets (480) and one additional in 481-488, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 each contribute 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 contributes 89.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the 8's:**\n- **Units place:** Each set of ten contributes one 8, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 each contribute 10, and 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " I'll consider each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of ten pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many groups of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups and then 8 extra pages. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit is 1-8, so no 4 there. So, units place gives us 48 fours.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for every group of a hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, in each hundred, there are 10 fours in the tens place. Since we have 488 pages, that's four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so it's four full hundreds plus 88 pages. But the tens place 4's occur in each hundred. So, from 1-100, 10 fours in the tens place (40-49). Similarly, 101-200, 140-149, another 10. Same for 201-300 and 301-400. That's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40 fours in the tens place. Now, what about the last partial hundred, 401-488? The tens digit here goes from 0 to 8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., up to 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the 8 in the tens place only goes up to 488. Wait, but the tens digit is 8 only from 480-489, but since we stop at 488, that's 9 numbers: 480-488, but wait, actually, 480-489 is ten numbers, but we only have up to 488. So, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. But we're only counting the tens digit, so in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, does that add 9 fours in the tens place? Wait, no, because we're looking for 4's, not 8's. So, in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8. So, when does the tens digit become 4? It's from 440-449, right? Because 440-449 would have 4 in the tens place. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 440-449. So, that adds another 10 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's 10 fours. So, total fours in the tens place: 40 (from the four hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50 fours.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, which means 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187 fours.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, considering units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place: For every group of ten, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of ten (as before) and 8 extra pages. Each group contributes one 8, so 48 times. In the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so the 8 appears once more (at 488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For every group of a hundred, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, in each hundred, 10 eights in the tens place. From 1-100, 10 eights (80-89). Similarly, 101-200, 180-189, another 10. Same for 201-300 and 301-400. That's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. Now, the last partial hundred, 401-488: the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, when is the tens digit 8? It's from 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480-488, that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for the last partial hundred. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, 40 (from four hundreds) + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total fours: 187, total eights: 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** For every 10 pages, 4 appears once. There are 48 full groups of 10 in 488 pages, contributing 48 fours. The remaining 8 pages (481-488) don't add any more 4's in the units place. Total: 48.\n- **Tens place:** In each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). With 4 hundreds (1-400), that's 40 fours. Additionally, in 401-488, 440-449 contributes another 10 fours. Total: 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, totaling 89 fours.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** For every 10 pages, 8 appears once. With 48 full groups, that's 48 eights. The remaining pages 481-488 add one more 8 (at 488). Total: 49.\n- **Tens place:** In each hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. With 4 hundreds, that's 40 eights. In 401-488, 480-488 contributes 9 eights. Total: 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let's consider single-digit page numbers: 1 to 9. The digit 4 appears once here, which is on page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence. Now, moving on to two-digit numbers: 10 to 99. In two-digit numbers, the digits can be in the tens place or the units place. Let's break this down. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers 40-49 have 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of the digit 4. \n\nFor the units place: Every ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.) have one number ending with 4. So, from 10-99, there are 9 sets of ten, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That's 9 occurrences. \n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. \n\nAdding that to the single-digit count, the total number of 4's so far is 1 + 19 = 20. \n\nNow, let's look at the three-digit numbers: 100-488. Again, the digits can be in the hundreds, tens, or units place. \n\nStarting with the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit 4 only goes up to 488, not 499. So, for the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488. Let's calculate how many numbers that is. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. \n\nNext, the tens place: In the three-digit numbers, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers each time. \n\nFrom 100-199: 140-149, that's 10 numbers. \n\nFrom 200-299: 240-249, another 10. \n\nFrom 300-399: 340-349, another 10. \n\nFrom 400-488: 440-449, but wait, 449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. \n\nSo, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 occurrences in the tens place. \n\nNow, the units place: Similarly, in each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears once every ten numbers. \n\nFrom 100-199: 104, 114, 124, ..., 194. That's 10 numbers. \n\nFrom 200-299: 204, 214, ..., 294. Another 10. \n\nFrom 300-399: 304, 314, ..., 394. Another 10. \n\nFrom 400-488: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, that's only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last one. So, 9 occurrences. \n\nSo, adding up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 occurrences in the units place. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 100-199: 10 numbers, same for 200-299 and 300-399. From 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The numbers would be 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 494 would be beyond 488. So yes, 9. So total units place 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. \n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168. \n\nAdding that to the previous total, the overall number of 4's is 20 (from single and two-digit) + 168 = 188. \n\nWait, hold on, that seems high. Let me check my math again. \n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, correct. \n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred, 10 numbers, so 4 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). But wait, 400-488 is not a full hundred, so in the tens place, does it still have 10 numbers? Let's see, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, 10 numbers. So 4 sets of 10, so 40. \n\nUnits place: Each hundred has 10 occurrences except the last one, which has 9. So 3*10 + 9 = 39. \n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. That seems correct. \n\nNow, moving on to counting the number of 8's. Let's do the same process. \n\nSingle-digit page numbers: 1-9. The digit 8 appears once, on page 8. So, 1 occurrence. \n\nTwo-digit numbers: 10-99. \n\nTens place: The numbers 80-89 have 8 in the tens place, that's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. \n\nUnits place: Every ten numbers (10-19, 20-29, etc.) have one number ending with 8. So from 10-99, that's 9 sets of ten, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 9 occurrences. \n\nTotal 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 + 9 = 19. \n\nAdding the single-digit count, total 8's so far: 1 + 19 = 20. \n\nNow, three-digit numbers: 100-488. \n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 in the hundreds place doesn't occur because the hundreds digits go up to 4. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. \n\nTens place: In each hundred, the tens digit cycles. So, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers. \n\nFrom 100-199: 180-189, that's 10 numbers. \n\nFrom 200-299: 280-289, another 10. \n\nFrom 300-399: 380-389, another 10. \n\nFrom 400-488: 480-489, but 488 is the last page, so only 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488). \n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. \n\nUnits place: Similarly, in each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, the digit 8 appears once every ten numbers. \n\nFrom 100-199: 108, 118, 128, ..., 198. That's 10 numbers. \n\nFrom 200-299: 208, 218, ..., 298. Another 10. \n\nFrom 300-399: 308, 318, ..., 398. Another 10. \n\nFrom 400-488: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included, but 498 would be beyond. \n\nSo, units place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. \n\nTherefore, in three-digit numbers, the total number of 8's is 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78. \n\nAdding that to the previous total, the overall number of 8's is 20 (from single and two-digit) + 78 = 98. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. \n\nSingle-digit: 1 \n\nTwo-digit: 19 \n\nThree-digit: 78 \n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98. \n\nAnd for 4's, we had 188. \n\nSo, the number of 4's minus the number of 8's is 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nHmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. \n\nWait, when counting 4's in the units place for three-digit numbers, I had 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. Similarly, for 8's, I had 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. \n\nBut wait, in the hundreds place for 4's, it's 89, which seems correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. \n\nFor 8's in the hundreds place, it's 0, correct. \n\nIn the tens place for 4's: 40, correct because each hundred contributes 10. \n\nIn the tens place for 8's: 39, correct because the last hundred only has 9. \n\nSame for units place: 4's had 39, 8's had 39. \n\nSo, 4's total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 in three-digit, plus 20 in single and two-digit: 188. \n\n8's total: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 in three-digit, plus 20 in single and two-digit: 98. \n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nWait, but I feel like that might be a lot. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a different approach to verify. \n\nAnother way is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position. \n\nFor a given digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated based on higher and lower digits. \n\nBut since I'm dealing with a specific range up to 488, maybe it's better to stick with the initial method. \n\nWait, let me recount the 4's and 8's in the units place for three-digit numbers. \n\nFor 4's in units place: \n\n100-199: 104, 114, 124, 134, 144, 154, 164, 174, 184, 194 \u2192 10 numbers. \n\n200-299: 204, 214, ..., 294 \u2192 10 numbers. \n\n300-399: 304, 314, ..., 394 \u2192 10 numbers. \n\n400-488: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484 \u2192 9 numbers. \n\nSo, 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. \n\nSame for 8's in units place: \n\n100-199: 108, 118, ..., 198 \u2192 10 numbers. \n\n200-299: 208, 218, ..., 298 \u2192 10 numbers. \n\n300-399: 308, 318, ..., 398 \u2192 10 numbers. \n\n400-488: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488 \u2192 9 numbers. \n\nSo, 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. \n\nThat seems correct. \n\nSimilarly, for tens place: \n\n4's in tens place: \n\n100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. \n\n200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. \n\n300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. \n\n400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. \n\nTotal: 40. \n\n8's in tens place: \n\n100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. \n\n200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. \n\n300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. \n\n400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers. \n\nTotal: 39. \n\nAnd hundreds place: \n\n4's: 400-488 \u2192 89 numbers. \n\n8's: 0 numbers. \n\nSo, adding up: \n\n4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. \n\n8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78. \n\nAdding single and two-digit counts: \n\n4's: 20 + 168 = 188. \n\n8's: 20 + 78 = 98. \n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I counted the single-digit and two-digit correctly. Let me check again. \n\nSingle-digit: \n\n4 appears once (page 4). \n\n8 appears once (page 8). \n\nTwo-digit numbers: \n\nFor 4's: tens place 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers, units place 14,24,...,94 \u2192 9 numbers. Total 19. \n\nFor 8's: tens place 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers, units place 18,28,...,98 \u2192 9 numbers. Total 19. \n\nSo, adding single-digit: \n\n4's: 1 + 19 = 20. \n\n8's: 1 + 19 = 20. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSo, the three-digit counts are 168 for 4's and 78 for 8's. \n\nThus, total 4's: 20 + 168 = 188. \n\nTotal 8's: 20 + 78 = 98. \n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be lower, but maybe 90 is correct. Let me think of another way to verify. \n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract. \n\nNumber of 4's: \n\n- Units place: For each hundred, 10 times, except the last one which might be less. \n\nWait, no, in the units place, for each hundred, it's 10 times, except when the hundreds digit is 4, the last hundred might have less. \n\nWait, but in this case, for 4's in the units place, from 100-199: 10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 39. \n\nSimilarly, in tens place: 40-49 in each hundred, except the last hundred which is 440-449, which is 10. So, 40. \n\nHundreds place: 400-488:89. \n\nTotal: 39 + 40 + 89 = 168. \n\nNumber of 8's: \n\nUnits place: 10 in each hundred except last, which is 9. So, 39. \n\nTens place: 10 in each hundred except last, which is 9. So, 39. \n\nHundreds place: 0. \n\nTotal: 39 + 39 = 78. \n\nAdding single and two-digit: \n\n4's: 20 + 168 = 188. \n\n8's: 20 + 78 = 98. \n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Single-digit (1-9):** 1 occurrence (page 4).\n   - **Two-digit (10-99):** \n     - Tens place: 10 (40-49).\n     - Units place: 9 (14, 24, ..., 94).\n     - Total: 19.\n   - **Three-digit (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: 89 (400-488).\n     - Tens place: 40 (40-49 in each hundred).\n     - Units place: 39 (104, 114, ..., 484).\n     - Total: 168.\n   - **Total 4's:** 20 (single + two-digit) + 168 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Single-digit (1-9):** 1 occurrence (page 8).\n   - **Two-digit (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 10 (80-89).\n     - Units place: 9 (18, 28, ..., 98).\n     - Total: 19.\n   - **Three-digit (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: 0.\n     - Tens place: 39 (80-89 in each hundred, except 480-488 which has 9).\n     - Units place: 39 (108, 118, ..., 488).\n     - Total: 78.\n   - **Total 8's:** 20 (single + two-digit) + 78 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I'll go through each range separately: 1. Single-digit pages (1-9): The only single-digit number with a 4 is 4 itself. So, that's 1 occurrence of the digit 4. 2. Two-digit pages (10-99): Here, the digit 4 can appear in the tens place or the units place. Let me calculate each separately. - Tens place: The numbers from 40 to 49 have 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. - Units place: For the units digit, 4 can appear in 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, that's 9 numbers. But wait, 44 has two 4's, so does that count twice? Hmm, I think so because each digit is counted separately. So, for the units place, it's 9 occurrences. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. But wait, let me check: from 10 to 99, for each ten's place, 4 occurs once every ten numbers. So, 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For the units place, in each ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so there are 9 sets (10-19 up to 90-99), so 9 times. So, yes, 10 + 9 = 19. So, 19 occurrences in two-digit numbers. 3. Three-digit pages (100-488): Now, this is more complex because there are hundreds, tens, and units places. Let's break it down by each digit place. First, let me note that 488 is the last page, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But 4 only goes up to 488, so hundreds digit 4 only goes up to 488, not 499. So, let me consider each place separately: a. Hundreds place: The digit 4 in the hundreds place occurs from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. b. Tens place: Now, looking at the tens digit, 4 can appear in the tens place in each hundred block. Let's go through each hundred block from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. - 100-199: The tens digit is 4 in 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. - 200-299: Similarly, 240-249: 10 occurrences. - 300-399: 340-349: 10 occurrences. - 400-488: The tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so 10 occurrences. So, total for tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40. But wait, wait a second. In the 400-488 range, the tens digit can be 4, but the units digit goes up to 8, but since we're only considering the tens place, it's still 10 numbers: 440-449, so yes, 10. So, total 40 occurrences in the tens place. c. Units place: Now, for the units digit, 4 can appear in every ten numbers. Let's go through each hundred block again. - 100-199: In each ten, like 100-109, 110-119, etc., the units digit is 4 once every ten. There are 10 sets of ten in each hundred, so 10 occurrences per hundred. So, 100-199: 10 occurrences. - 200-299: Similarly, 10 occurrences. - 300-399: 10 occurrences. - 400-488: Now, this is a bit different because it's not a full hundred. Let me calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place here. From 400 to 488, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every ten numbers. So, how many full tens are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. 89 divided by 10 is 8 full tens (400-480) and 9 extra numbers (481-488). In each full ten, the units digit is 4 once, so 8 times. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total in 400-488: 8 occurrences. So, adding up: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 8 (400-488) = 38 occurrences in the units place. So, total 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds (89) + tens (40) + units (38) = 89 + 40 = 129 + 38 = 167. So, total 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (167) = 1 + 19 = 20 + 167 = 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, breaking it down into single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit pages. 1. Single-digit pages (1-9): The only single-digit number with an 8 is 8 itself. So, 1 occurrence. 2. Two-digit pages (10-99): Again, looking at tens and units places. - Tens place: The numbers from 80 to 89 have 8 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. - Units place: For the units digit, 8 can appear in 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 numbers. But wait, 88 has two 8's, so does that count twice? Yes, because each digit is counted separately. So, 9 occurrences. So, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. 3. Three-digit pages (100-488): Let's break this down by each digit place. a. Hundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place occurs from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. b. Tens place: Looking at the tens digit, 8 can appear in each hundred block. Let's go through each hundred block from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. - 100-199: The tens digit is 8 in 180-189. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. - 200-299: Similarly, 280-289: 10 occurrences. - 300-399: 380-389: 10 occurrences. - 400-488: The tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 in all these, so 9 occurrences. So, total for tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. c. Units place: Now, for the units digit, 8 can appear in every ten numbers. Let's go through each hundred block again. - 100-199: In each ten, the units digit is 8 once every ten. There are 10 sets of ten, so 10 occurrences. - 200-299: Similarly, 10 occurrences. - 300-399: 10 occurrences. - 400-488: Now, from 400 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences. So, total in units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. So, total 8's in three-digit numbers: hundreds (0) + tens (39) + units (39) = 78. So, total 8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) = 1 + 19 = 20 + 78 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Tens place: in each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), each has 10 occurrences except 400-488, which has 10 as well (440-449). So, 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. Units place: in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each has 10, so 30. In 400-488: 8 occurrences. So, 30 + 8 = 38. So, 89 + 40 + 38 = 167. Then, adding single and two-digit: 1 + 19 = 20. 20 + 167 = 187. That seems correct. Now, 8's: single-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:78. 1+19=20, 20+78=98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) across single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit page numbers.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - Only one occurrence: 4.\n   - Total: 1.\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** 40-49 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n   - **Units place:** 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - **Units place:** In each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) \u2192 10 each, totaling 30.

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: the only single-digit number with a 4 is page 4. So that's one occurrence of 4. \n\nNow, moving on to two-digit numbers. Two-digit numbers range from 10 to 99. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers from 40 to 49 have 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers (40, 41, ..., 49), so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. \n\nFor the units place: The numbers where the units digit is 4 are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, but wait, 44 has two 4's, so in the units place, each of these contributes one 4. So that's 9 occurrences. \n\nWait, but from 10 to 99, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So for each ten, there's one 4 in the units place. From 10 to 99, that's 9 tens (10s, 20s, ..., 90s). So 9 times, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 40 to 49 is already counted in the tens place. So in the units place, it's 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94, which is 9 numbers, but 44 has both tens and units as 4, but we're only counting the units place here. So that's 9 occurrences. \n\nWait, but 44 is part of both counts. So when counting the tens place, 44 is included, and when counting the units place, 44 is also included. So for the two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. But wait, 44 has two 4's, so when I add them up, I'm counting both digits, so 10 + 9 = 19, which is correct because 44 contributes two 4's, and the rest contribute one each. \n\nWait, no, actually, when I count the tens place, I'm counting each 4 in the tens place, regardless of the units digit. Similarly, when I count the units place, I'm counting each 4 in the units place, regardless of the tens digit. So 44 is counted once in the tens place and once in the units place, so that's correct. So total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 + 9 = 19. \n\nWait, but from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers. Let me check: from 10 to 99, the number of 4's in the tens place is 10 (40-49), and the number of 4's in the units place is 9 (14,24,...,94). So total 19 4's in two-digit numbers. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers, which are from 100 to 488. \n\nFirst, I'll consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\nFor the hundreds place: Only the numbers from 400 to 488 have 4 in the hundreds place. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). So that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. \n\nNext, the tens place: I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488. \n\nThe tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit is 4 in the range x40 to x49, where x is the hundreds digit. \n\nFrom 100-199: 140-149: 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. \n\nFrom 200-299: 240-249: 10 numbers, 10 4's. \n\nFrom 300-399: 340-349: 10 numbers, 10 4's. \n\nFrom 400-488: The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. \n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is entirely within 400-488. So that's 10 numbers. \n\nSo total 4's in the tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40. \n\nWait, but wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So yes, 10. So total 4's in the tens place across all three-digit numbers: 40. \n\nNow, the units place for three-digit numbers: how many times does 4 appear in the units place from 100 to 488. \n\nEach hundred has 10 numbers ending with 4: 104,114,...,194 in 100-199; 204,214,...,294 in 200-299; 304,314,...,394 in 300-399; and 404,414,...,484 in 400-488. \n\nWait, but in 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488. So from 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs 9 times. \n\nWait, let me check: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484: that's 9 numbers. \n\nSo for each hundred except the last one (400-488), there are 10 numbers with units digit 4. \n\nSo total units digit 4's in three-digit numbers: \n\n100-199: 10 \n\n200-299: 10 \n\n300-399: 10 \n\n400-488: 9 \n\nTotal: 10+10+10+9 = 39. \n\nWait, but wait, 400-488 includes 488, so 484 is the last one ending with 4. So yes, 9 numbers. \n\nSo total 4's in the units place for three-digit numbers: 39. \n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's: \n\nSingle-digit: 1 \n\nTwo-digit: 19 \n\nThree-digit: hundreds place 89, tens place 40, units place 39. \n\nWait, no, wait: in the three-digit numbers, the hundreds place has 89 4's (from 400-488), the tens place has 40 4's, and the units place has 39 4's. \n\nSo total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. \n\nWait, but let me check that again. \n\nHundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So 89. \n\nTens place: 10 in each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), so 4 sets, each contributing 10, but wait, 400-488's tens place 4's are only from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 10. So total tens place 4's: 4*10=40. \n\nUnits place: 10 in each of the first three hundreds, and 9 in the last, so 10+10+10+9=39. \n\nSo 89+40+39=168. \n\nNow, total 4's in the entire book: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1 + 19 + 168 = 188. \n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check. \n\nWait, single-digit: 1 (page 4). \n\nTwo-digit: tens place 10 (40-49), units place 9 (14,24,...,94). So 10+9=19. \n\nThree-digit: hundreds place 89 (400-488), tens place 40 (10 per hundred for 4 hundreds), units place 39 (10 per hundred for first three, 9 for last). So 89+40+39=168. \n\nTotal 4's: 1+19+168=188. \n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. \n\nStarting with single-digit: page 8. So that's one occurrence. \n\nTwo-digit numbers: count 8's in tens and units place. \n\nTens place: 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. \n\nUnits place: numbers ending with 8 from 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, but 88 has two 8's, so in the units place, each contributes one 8. So 9 occurrences. \n\nWait, but 88 is in both counts, so when I add them, it's 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 8's in two-digit numbers. \n\nWait, but let me check: from 10-99, the tens digit 8 is 10 numbers (80-89), and the units digit 8 is 9 numbers (18,28,...,98). So total 19 8's in two-digit numbers. \n\nNow, three-digit numbers: 100-488. \n\nHundreds place: Only 400-488 have hundreds digit 4, but 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place in three-digit numbers here because the hundreds digits are 1,2,3,4. So no 8's in the hundreds place. \n\nTens place: Count how many times 8 appears in the tens place from 100-488. \n\nEach hundred has a set where the tens digit is 8: x80 to x89, where x is the hundreds digit. \n\nFrom 100-199: 180-189: 10 numbers, 10 8's. \n\nFrom 200-299: 280-289: 10 numbers, 10 8's. \n\nFrom 300-399: 380-389: 10 numbers, 10 8's. \n\nFrom 400-488: The tens digit 8 would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So 9 8's in the tens place. \n\nSo total 8's in the tens place: 10+10+10+9=39. \n\nUnits place: Count how many times 8 appears in the units place from 100-488. \n\nEach hundred has 10 numbers ending with 8: 108,118,...,198 in 100-199; 208,218,...,298 in 200-299; 308,318,...,398 in 300-399; and 408,418,...,488 in 400-488. \n\nIn 400-488, the units digit 8 occurs in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers. \n\nSo total units place 8's: 10 (100-199) +10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+9 (400-488)=39. \n\nSo total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place 39 + units place 39 = 78. \n\nNow, adding up all 8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) = 1+19+78=98. \n\nWait, that can't be right because I thought 4's were 188 and 8's are 98, so the difference would be 90. But let me check again. \n\nWait, let me recount the 8's in three-digit numbers. \n\nTens place: 100-199: 180-189: 10 8's. \n\n200-299: 280-289: 10. \n\n300-399: 380-389:10. \n\n400-488: 480-488: 9. \n\nTotal tens place 8's: 10+10+10+9=39. \n\nUnits place: 100-199: 108,118,...,198:10. \n\n200-299:208,218,...,298:10. \n\n300-399:308,318,...,398:10. \n\n400-488:408,418,...,488:9. \n\nTotal units place 8's:10+10+10+9=39. \n\nSo total three-digit 8's:39+39=78. \n\nAdding single-digit 8 (1) and two-digit 8's (19): 1+19=20. \n\nWait, no, wait: single-digit 8 is 1, two-digit 8's are 19, three-digit 8's are 78. So total 8's:1+19+78=98. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought 8's in two-digit numbers were 19, which included both tens and units place. So that's correct. \n\nNow, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. \n\nDifference:188-98=90. \n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the 4's in the three-digit units place. Let me check again. \n\nIn three-digit numbers, units place 4's: \n\n100-199:104,114,...,194:10 numbers. \n\n200-299:204,214,...,294:10. \n\n300-399:304,314,...,394:10. \n\n400-488:404,414,...,484:9 numbers. \n\nSo total units place 4's:10+10+10+9=39. \n\nWait, but earlier I had 39 as units place 4's, which seems correct. \n\nSo total 4's:1 (single) +19 (two-digit) +168 (three-digit)=188. \n\nWait, but 168 comes from hundreds, tens, and units in three-digit. Let me check that again. \n\nThree-digit 4's: hundreds place 89, tens place 40, units place 39. So 89+40+39=168. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSo total 4's:188, 8's:98. \n\nDifference:188-98=90. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a big difference. Let me check if I missed any counts. \n\nWait, in single-digit, 4 appears once, 8 appears once. \n\nIn two-digit numbers, 4's:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19. \n\n8's:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19. \n\nIn three-digit numbers: \n\n4's: hundreds 89, tens 40, units 39=168. \n\n8's: tens 39, units 39=78. \n\nSo total 4's:1+19+168=188. \n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98. \n\nDifference:188-98=90. \n\nHmm, maybe that's correct. \n\nWait, but let me think again: in three-digit numbers, for 4's, the hundreds place is 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. \n\nTens place: for each hundred, 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, so 4 hundreds (100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. \n\nUnits place: for the first three hundreds, 10 each, and the last hundred (400-488) has 9, so 10+10+10+9=39. \n\nSo 89+40+39=168. \n\nSimilarly, for 8's, in three-digit numbers: \n\nTens place: 10 per hundred for first three, and 9 in the last, so 10+10+10+9=39. \n\nUnits place: same, 10+10+10+9=39. \n\nSo 39+39=78. \n\nAdding single and two-digit:1+19=20, so total 8's=20+78=98. \n\nYes, that seems consistent. \n\nSo the difference is 188-98=90. \n\nWait, but let me think if I double-counted anywhere. For example, in two-digit numbers, 44 has two 4's, but I counted both in tens and units place, which is correct because each digit is counted separately. Similarly, 88 has two 8's, so that's correctly counted in both tens and units. \n\nIn three-digit numbers, 444 would have three 4's, but I think I've counted each occurrence separately, so that's correct. \n\nI think my counts are accurate. So the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's. \n\nWait, no, 188-98=90, so 90 more 4's than 8's. \n\nI think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's:**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 4. \u2192 1 occurrence.\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: Pages 40-49 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total for two-digit: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: Pages 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n     - Tens place: Each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place \u2192 4\u00d710 = 40.\n     - Units place: Each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has 10 numbers ending with 4; 400-488 has 9 \u2192 10+10+10+9 = 39.\n     - Total for three-digit: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n   - **Total 4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n2. **Count the number of 8's:**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 8. \u2192 1 occurrence.\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: Pages 80-89 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total for two-digit: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Tens place: Each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place; 400-488 has 9 \u2192 10+10+10+9 = 39.\n     - Units place: Each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has 10 numbers ending with 8; 400-488 has 9 \u2192 10+10+10+9 = 39.\n     - Total for three-digit: 39 + 39 = 78.\n   - **Total 8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " I'll consider each position in the page numbers separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives me 48 fours. But wait, the last set is 481-490, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, the units place 4 in 484 would be included, but 494 isn't there. Hmm, actually, 488 is the last page, so in the units place, the 4's occur in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. Let me calculate how many that is. The first 4 in the units place is at 4, then every 10 pages after that. So, the positions are 4,14,24,...,484. To find how many terms are in this sequence, I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d. Here, a_1=4, d=10, a_n=484. So, 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10. Subtracting 4 from both sides gives 480 = (n-1)*10. Dividing both sides by 10 gives 48 = n-1, so n=49. So, there are 49 fours in the units place. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. The number of complete cycles is 48 (since 488/10=48.8), but each cycle contributes one 4, so that's 48 fours. However, the last partial cycle from 481-488 includes 484, which is another 4 in the units place. So, total units place fours are 48 +1=49. Okay, that makes sense.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nAdding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: Similar to fours, the digit 8 appears once every ten numbers. From 1-488, how many 8's in the units place? The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many terms. Using the same arithmetic sequence formula: a_n=488, a_1=8, d=10. So, 488=8 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 8: 480=(n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48=n-1, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers, contributing 10 eights in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four blocks. So, 4*10=40 eights in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49+40=89. So, 89 eights in total.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 89 = 99.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor eights:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:40\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+40=89. Correct.\n\nDifference:188-89=99. So, 99 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 89. Subtracting these gives 99 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{99}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I'll consider the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each of these 48 groups, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, I'll look at the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a block of 10 numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: the first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 is another, and 340-349 is another. That's four blocks. Each contributes 10 4's, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, the last block is 340-349, and after that, we have 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the tens digit is 0-8. The digit 4 appears in the tens place only from 400-409, which is 10 numbers, but since 400-488 includes 400-409, that's another 10 4's. So, total for tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349) plus 10 from 400-409, totaling 50. Wait, no, because 400-409 is part of the 400-488 range, so I think I should include that. So, 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, and 400-409 is another 10. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89), but wait, actually, from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, but the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, but each of those has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. But let me confirm: 488 - 400 = 88, so adding 1 gives 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. Wait, that can't be right because 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. Hmm, but let me check again because 488 is a three-digit number, so maybe I overcounted somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me think again. From 1 to 99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so no 4's there. From 100 to 399, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, so no 4's. From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's. That seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place: from 40-49, that's 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Similarly, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 400-409. Wait, but 400-409 is part of the 400-488 range, so that's another 10. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: for each ten, 4 appears once. From 1 to 488, how many tens? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Plus, in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no 4 there. So, 48 in units.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187. Wait, that's 48+50=98, plus 89=187. Hmm, that seems high, but maybe it's correct.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full tens and 8 extra numbers. So, 48 times 1 = 48 8's in the units place. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once here (at 488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place.\n- 180-189: another 10.\n- 280-289: another 10.\n- 380-389: another 10.\n- 480-488: here, the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only for numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once at 488, so 48+1=49. Tens place: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9, so 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the 4's were 187, and 8's are 98, so the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89. But let me confirm if I counted correctly.\n\nWait, but let me check the 4's again because 187 seems a bit high. Let me recount.\n\nUnits place: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. In the last 8 numbers, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so no 4. So, units place 4's: 48.\n\nTens place: 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 400-409:10. That's 5 blocks, each 10, so 50. So, tens place 4's:50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 48+50+89=187.\n\n8's: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0, total 98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place in 4's, I have 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\nUnits place:48.\n\nSo, 48+50=98, plus 89=187.\n\nFor 8's, units place:49, tens place:49, so 98.\n\nSo, 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I count the 4's in the tens place, I included 400-409 as a separate block, but is that correct? Because 400-409 is part of the 400-488 range, and in the tens place, it's 0, so 400-409 would have 0 in the tens place, right? Wait, no. Wait, 400-409: the tens digit is 0, so the digit in the tens place is 0, not 4. Wait, that's a mistake!\n\nOh no, I think I made a mistake here. When I was counting the tens place for 4's, I included 400-409 as a block where the tens digit is 4, but that's incorrect. In 400-409, the tens digit is 0, so the digit 4 doesn't appear in the tens place there. So, I overcounted by 10.\n\nLet me correct that. So, for the tens place, the blocks where the tens digit is 4 are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, and 340-349. That's four blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nI mistakenly included 400-409, but that's where the hundreds digit is 4, not the tens. So, the tens digit in 400-409 is 0, so no 4's there in the tens place.\n\nSo, correcting that, the tens place for 4's is 40, not 50.\n\nSimilarly, the hundreds place for 4's is 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nUnits place:48.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 48+40=88, plus 89=177.\n\nWait, that's different. So, now, 4's are 177.\n\nNow, 8's: units place is 49, tens place is 49, so total 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 177 - 98 = 79.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier by including 400-409 as a block contributing to the tens place, but it's actually part of the hundreds place. So, the correct count for 4's in the tens place is 40, not 50.\n\nLet me confirm this again.\n\nIn the tens place, the digit 4 appears in the following ranges:\n\n- 40-49: tens digit is 4, so 10 numbers.\n- 140-149: tens digit is 4, 10 numbers.\n- 240-249: tens digit is 4, 10 numbers.\n- 340-349: tens digit is 4, 10 numbers.\n\nThat's four blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 4*10=40.\n\n400-409: tens digit is 0, so no 4's in the tens place there. The 4 is in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, yes, 40 4's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (48) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 48+40=88, plus 89=177.\n\n8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nSo, 177 - 98 = 79.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again for 8's. From 1 to 488, how many 8's in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial ten, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, total units place 8's:48+1=49.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 4's:177, 8's:98, difference:177-98=79.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 187, but after correcting, it's 177. So, the correct difference is 79.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's there.\n\nUnits place:48.\n\nTens place:40.\n\nTotal:89+48=137, plus 40=177.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be 79 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, in the tens place for 4's, I had 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, each contributing 10, so 40. That's correct.\n\nUnits place:48.\n\nHundreds place:89.\n\nSo, 40+48+89=177.\n\n8's: units 49, tens 49, so 98.\n\n177-98=79.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 79 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 177, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 79 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{79}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. For every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, we'll take the integer part, which is 48 full sets of 10. Each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 fours. But wait, we have 488 pages, which is 48 full sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In those extra numbers, the units digit is 4 only once, which is 484. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4. So, how many times does this happen from 1 to 488? Well, in each hundred, it's 10 times. There are four hundreds in 488 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488). Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so there are four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. In each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 440-449. That's another 10 fours. So, total fours in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, hold on, 401-488 is only 88 numbers, right? So, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct, 10 fours. So, total tens place fours are 50. \n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of fours is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me double-check because that seems high. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all those numbers. So, yes, that's 89 fours. So, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll use the same approach.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each set of 10, that's one 8, so 48 eights. In the extra numbers, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total units place eights are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. From 1 to 488, how many times does this happen? In each hundred, it's 10 times. There are four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), does the tens digit 8 appear? Let's see: 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, yes, 9 eights. So, total tens place eights are 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place eights are 0.\n\nSo, total number of eights is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98 eights. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place was 49 and tens place was 49, so 98. But when I calculated fours, I got 188. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big difference.\n\nWait, let me go back and verify each step carefully.\n\nStarting with the number of fours:\n\nUnits place: For each 10 numbers, one 4 in units. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4. So, 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 484 has a 4 in units. So, total units fours: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. So, 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow for the eights:\n\nUnits place: Each 10 numbers, one 8. 48 full sets, so 48. Then, in 481-488, 488 has an 8 in units. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred, 10 numbers with 8 in tens. So, 4 hundreds, 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: No numbers in 1-488 have 8 in hundreds place, so 0.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for eights. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn each hundred:\n\n1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10 eights.\n\n101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10 eights.\n\n201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10 eights.\n\n301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10 eights.\n\n401-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 eights (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488).\n\nSo, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for fours in tens place:\n\n1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10 fours.\n\n101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10 fours.\n\n201-300: 240-249 \u2192 10 fours.\n\n301-400: 340-349 \u2192 10 fours.\n\n401-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 fours.\n\nSo, 10*4 + 10 = 50 fours in tens place.\n\nWait, but 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nSo, fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nEights: 49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this by digit position separately.\n\nLet's consider each digit position: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nFor each position, count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nNumber of 4's in units: floor(488/10)=48 full tens, each contributing one 4. Then, check the remaining 8 numbers (481-488). 484 has a 4 in units. So, total 48+1=49.\n\nNumber of 8's in units: same as above, floor(488/10)=48, plus 488 has an 8, so 48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of 4's in tens: For each hundred, 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours. So, 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is another 10. So, total 40+10=50.\n\nNumber of 8's in tens: For each hundred, 10 numbers where tens digit is 8. So, 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 eights. So, 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's in hundreds: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nNumber of 8's in hundreds: Since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nNow, summing up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, that's consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't overcount in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct.\n\nAnd for 8's, no hundreds place counts, so 0.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I'll consider single-digit page numbers. These are from 1 to 9. The digit 4 appears once here, which is on page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence. \n\nNext, I'll look at two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. In two-digit numbers, the digits can be in the tens place or the units place. I'll need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers from 40 to 49 have 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers (40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49), so that's 10 occurrences. \n\nFor the units place: The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers.

That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. So, in two-digit numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place and 9 times in the units place, totaling 19 times. \n\nWait, but wait, when I count from 40 to 49, that's 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place, so that's correct. And for the units place, it's 9 times, as I listed. So, 10 + 9 = 19 occurrences of 4 in two-digit numbers. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Here, each number has hundreds, tens, and units digits. I need to count how many times 4 appears in each of these places. \n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. In the range 100-488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for the hundreds digit being 4, the numbers are from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nNext, the tens place. For the tens digit, 4 can appear in any of the hundreds numbers. Let me break it down by each hundred. \n\nFrom 100-199: The tens digit can be 4 in the numbers 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. \n\nFrom 200-299: Similarly, 240-249, another 10 occurrences. \n\nFrom 300-399: 340-349, another 10 occurrences. \n\nFrom 400-488: Here, the tens digit can be 4 in 440-449. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 400-488. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. \n\nWait, but wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in each hundred, except maybe the last one? Wait, no, because 400-488 is part of the 400s, so the tens digit can be 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in total, the tens place has 4 appearing 10 times in each of the four hundreds (100s, 200s, 300s, 400s), so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. \n\nWait, but wait, 400-488 is only up to 488, so does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 10 occurrences in the 400s. So, total for tens place is 40. \n\nNow, the units place. In each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? In each hundred, for each ten, 4 appears once in the units place. So, for example, in 100-199, the units digit is 4 in 104, 114, 124, 134, 144, 154, 164, 174, 184, 194. That's 10 times. Similarly, in 200-299, it's 204, 214, ..., 294, another 10 times. Same for 300-399: 304, 314, ..., 394, 10 times. \n\nNow, in 400-488, the units digit is 4 in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, but 484 is within 488, so that's 9 times. Because from 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs at 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 494 would be beyond 488, so it stops at 484. So, in the 400s, units digit 4 appears 9 times. \n\nSo, in the units place, for the hundreds: 100s, 200s, 300s each have 10 occurrences, and 400s have 9. So, total units digit 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. \n\nWait, let me confirm that. From 100-199: 10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39. \n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, the number of 4's is:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 40\n- Units place: 39\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. So, 168 occurrences of 4 in three-digit page numbers.\n\nNow, let me add up all the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check the three-digit numbers. Wait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. \n\nIn the tens place, 10 per hundred, times 4 hundreds: 40, correct. \n\nIn the units place, 10 per hundred for the first three hundreds, and 9 in the last, so 39. So, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. Then, adding single and two-digit: 1 + 19 = 20, plus 168 is 188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process.\n\nSingle-digit page numbers: 1-9. The digit 8 appears once, on page 8. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers: 10-99.\n\nIn the tens place: Numbers from 80-89 have 8 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nIn the units place: The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, in 10-99, it's 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, 8 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times.\n\nNow, three-digit page numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: Let's check each hundred.\n\nFrom 100-199: The tens digit is 8 in 180-189. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 200-299: Similarly, 280-289, another 10.\n\nFrom 300-399: 380-389, another 10.\n\nFrom 400-488: The tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but wait, in the tens place, 480-488 is part of the 400s. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, in the tens place, total 8's: 10 (100s) +10 (200s)+10 (300s)+9 (400s) = 39.\n\nNow, the units place: For each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nFrom 100-199: 108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198. That's 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 200-299: 208,218,...,298. 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 300-399: 308,318,...,398. 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 400-488: The units digit 8 occurs at 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 498 would be beyond 488, so we stop at 488. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, units place 8's: 10 +10 +10 +9 = 39.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, the number of 8's is:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 39\n- Units place: 39\nTotal: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nWait, 39 +39 is 78. Hmm.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit:78\nTotal 8's:1 +19 +78=98.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Single-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:78. So, 1+19=20, plus 78 is 98. \n\nWait, but let me double-check the three-digit counts. Tens place: 10+10+10+9=39. Units place:10+10+10+9=39. So, 39+39=78. That's correct. So, 78 in three-digit, plus 19 in two-digit, plus 1 in single-digit: 78+19=97, plus 1 is 98. So, 98 occurrences of 8.\n\nWait, but earlier when I counted the units place in three-digit numbers, from 400-488, I had 9 occurrences. Let me list them to make sure: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, so correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for 400-488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so correct.\n\nSo, total 8's:98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 188, and 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot, but let me check again.\n\nWait, in three-digit numbers, I had 168 4's and 78 8's. So, 168 -78=90. Then, adding the single and two-digit: 4's had 20 more (1+19), and 8's had 20 more (1+19). So, the difference remains 90. So, yes, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's and 8's.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, for 4's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\n- Tens place: 10 per hundred for 100s, 200s, 300s, and 10 in 400s, so 4*10=40.\n\n- Units place: 10 in 100s, 10 in 200s, 10 in 300s, and 9 in 400s, so 39.\n\nTotal:89+40+39=168. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\n- Tens place: 10 in 100s, 10 in 200s, 10 in 300s, 9 in 400s, so 39.\n\n- Units place: 10 in 100s, 10 in 200s, 10 in 300s, 9 in 400s, so 39.\n\nTotal: 0+39+39=78. Correct.\n\nAdding single and two-digit:\n\n4's:1+19=20.\n\n8's:1+19=20.\n\nSo, total 4's:168+20=188.\n\nTotal 8's:78+20=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 40-49 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n     - Tens place: 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 10 each, totaling 40.\n     - Units place: In each hundred (100s, 200s, 300s), 10 each, and in 400s, 9 (404, 414, ..., 484) \u2192 39.\n     - Total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n   - **Total '4's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** 8 appears once (page 8).\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 80-89 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: None (800-899 exceeds 488).\n     - Tens place: 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 10, 10, 10, 9 \u2192 39.\n     - Units place: In each hundred (100s, 200s, 300s), 10 each, and in 400s, 9 (408, 418, ..., 488) \u2192 39.\n     - Total: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n   - **Total '8's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 times more than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let's handle the single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. The digit 4 appears once here, on page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence of 4. Now, moving on to two-digit numbers, from 10 to 99. I can think of each two-digit number as having a tens place and a units place. So, I'll count the number of 4's in the tens place and the number of 4's in the units place separately.\n\nIn the tens place, the numbers from 40 to 49 will have a 4 in the tens digit. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4. In the units place, the 4 appears in every set of ten numbers, like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, etc. From 10 to 99, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, for each ten, it's once, so from 10-19, 20-29, up to 90-99, that's 9 sets, but wait, from 10 to 99, there are 9 tens (10s, 20s, ..., 90s), but actually, it's 9 sets of ten, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Wait, no, actually, from 10-99, there are 9 tens, but each ten has one 4 in the units place, so that's 9 times. But wait, from 10-99, that's 90 numbers, so 9 sets of ten, each with one 4 in the units place, so 9 occurrences. But wait, 44 has two 4's, so I might be double-counting. Wait, no, because I'm counting the tens place and the units place separately. So, in the units place, from 10-99, the 4 appears once every ten numbers, so that's 9 times. But wait, from 10-99, that's 90 numbers, so 90/10 = 9, so 9 times in the units place. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. But wait, 44 is included in both, so does that mean I'm counting the 4 in 44 twice? Let me check. Yes, because in the tens place, 44 is counted once, and in the units place, it's counted again. So, that's correct because 44 has two 4's. So, 10 + 9 = 19 4's in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers, from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex. Let me break it down by hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for the hundreds digit being 4, the numbers are from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences of 4.\n\nNext, let's count the number of 4's in the tens place for three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9, and the hundreds digit is 1-3 or 4. But since we're counting 4's in the tens place, let's consider each hundred separately.\n\nFor hundreds digit 1, 2, 3: For each of these, the tens digit can be 4, and the units digit can be 0-9. So, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the number of times 4 appears in the tens place is 10 times per hundred. So, 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 occurrences.\n\nNow, for the hundreds digit 4 (400-488), the tens digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, when the tens digit is 4, how many numbers are there? From 440 to 449, that's 10 numbers. So, 10 occurrences in the tens place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 40.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 4's in the units place for three-digit numbers. Again, let's consider hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: For each hundred, the units digit can be 4, and the tens digit can be 0-9. So, for each hundred, that's 10 numbers (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194). So, 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 occurrences.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4 (400-488): The units digit can be 4, and the tens digit can be 0-8. So, from 404, 414, ..., 484. How many is that? Let's see, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, so that's 9 possibilities (0-8). Wait, but 484 is included, which is when the tens digit is 8. So, 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 4's in the units place for three-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89 + 40 = 129 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, let me check that addition again: 89 + 40 is 129, and 129 + 39 is indeed 168. So, 168 4's in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 168\n\nTotal 4's = 1 + 19 = 20 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, 1 + 19 is 20, plus 168 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with single-digit numbers: 8 appears once, on page 8.\n\nNow, two-digit numbers: from 10 to 99.\n\nFirst, the tens place: numbers from 80-89 have 8 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nIn the units place: 8 appears once every ten numbers, like 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 times because from 10-99, there are 9 sets of ten, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Wait, but 88 has two 8's, so does that affect the count? No, because I'm counting the tens place and units place separately. So, in the units place, it's 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers: from 100 to 488.\n\nFirst, hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place in a 488-page book because the hundreds digit only goes up to 4. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit can be 8. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nFor hundreds 1, 2, 3: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, like 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. So, 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 occurrences.\n\nFor hundreds 4 (400-488): The tens digit can be 8, so numbers from 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, 9 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's in the tens place: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nUnits place: Now, for each hundred, the units digit can be 8. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the units place.\n\nFor hundreds 1, 2, 3: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the units digit is 8, like 108, 118, ..., 198; similarly for 200s and 300s. So, 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 occurrences.\n\nFor hundreds 4 (400-488): The units digit can be 8, so numbers like 408, 418, ..., 488. How many is that? Let's see, the tens digit can be 0-8, so that's 9 possibilities (0-8), each giving a number ending with 8. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's in the units place: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place (39) + units place (39) = 78.\n\nWait, no, wait: hundreds place is 0, tens place is 39, units place is 39. So, total 8's in three-digit numbers: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 8's from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 78\n\nTotal 8's = 1 + 19 = 20 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, 1 + 19 is 20, plus 78 is 98. So, 98 8's in total.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, checking the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1 (page 4)\n- Two-digit: 10 (40-49) + 9 (units place 4's) = 19\n- Three-digit: hundreds place 89 (400-488), tens place 40 (30 from 100-399, 10 from 400-488), units place 39 (30 from 100-399, 9 from 400-488). Total 89+40+39=168. Then 1+19+168=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1 (page 8)\n- Two-digit: 10 (80-89) + 9 (units place 8's) = 19\n- Three-digit: tens place 39 (30 from 100-399, 9 from 400-488), units place 39 (30 from 100-399, 9 from 400-488). Total 39+39=78. Then 1+19+78=98. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 40-49 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n     - Tens place: \n       - 100-399: 10 occurrences per hundred \u00d7 3 hundreds = 30.\n       - 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n       - Total: 30 + 10 = 40.\n     - Units place:\n       - 100-399: 10 occurrences per hundred \u00d7 3 hundreds = 30.\n       - 400-488: 404, 414, ..., 484 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n       - Total: 30 + 9 = 39.\n     - Total for three-digit: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n   - **Total '4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** 8 appears once (page 8).\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 80-89 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: 8 does not appear.\n     - Tens place:\n       - 100-399: 10 occurrences per hundred \u00d7 3 hundreds = 30.\n       - 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n       - Total: 30 + 9 = 39.\n     - Units place:\n       - 100-399: 10 occurrences per hundred \u00d7 3 hundreds = 30.\n       - 400-488: 408, 418, ..., 488 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n       - Total: 30 + 9 = 39.\n     - Total for three-digit: 39 + 39 = 78.\n   - **Total '8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - More '4's than '8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4); from 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups and a partial group of 8 pages (481-488). Each complete group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once more in 484. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of 10 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, each hundred has one such block (40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, from 1-488, how many hundreds are there? Let's see: 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred from 401-488. In each complete hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49 in the first hundred). So, 4 complete hundreds contribute 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, but wait, 401-488 is actually in the 400s. So, the tens digit being 4 would be from 440-449. That's another 10 numbers. So, in the partial hundred, we have 10 more 4's. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, contributing 89 more 4's.\n\nAdding up the 4's: Units (49) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, each group of 10 has one 8 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. The partial group is 481-488, which has units digits 1-8. So, 8 appears once in 488. So, total 8's in units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers in each hundred. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing one block of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the partial hundred, we have 9 more 8's. So, total 8's in tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only for numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nAdding up the 8's: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full groups + 1 in the last partial group = 49\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds (each contributing 10) = 40, plus in the 400s, 440-449 is 10, so 50\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full groups + 1 in the last partial group = 49\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds (each contributing 10) = 40, plus in the 400s, 480-488 is 9, so 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 4.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u21d2 48 complete groups, each contributing 1 \u21d2 48.\n   - The last partial group (481-488) has one more 4 (page 484).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49).\n   - 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.88 \u21d2 4 complete hundreds \u21d2 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - The partial hundred (401-488) includes 440-449, contributing another 10.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, 48 complete groups \u21d2 48.\n   - The last partial group (481-488) has one more 8 (page 488).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (e.g., 80-89).\n   - 4 complete hundreds \u21d2 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - The partial hundred (401-488) includes 480-488, contributing 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I'll consider the units place. For every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, from 1-10, the digit 4 appears once (at page 4). Similarly, from 11-20, it appears once at page 14, and so on. \n\nNow, let's calculate how many full sets of ten are there in 488 pages. Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of ten and a partial set of 8 pages (481-488). So, in each of these 48 full sets, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. That gives me 48 instances of 4 in the units place. \n\nBut wait, I also need to consider the last partial set, which is from 481 to 488. Let me list these numbers: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Looking at the units digit, I see 484 has a 4 in the units place. So, that's one more 4. Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, I need to consider the tens place. The digit 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, from 40-49, each number has a 4 in the tens place. So, that's 10 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, starting from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, but 540-549 would be beyond 488, so we don't have that. Let me count how many full sets of 100 we have. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. \n\nIn each hundred, the set 40-49 contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, for each of the four full hundreds, that's 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40 4's. Now, what about the last partial hundred, 401-488? Let me check the tens place in this range. The numbers 440-449 have a 4 in the tens place. That's another 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. So, that's 10 more 4's. \n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, adding that, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, I should also check the hundreds place. The digit 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400. Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. Let me see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nWait, but 400 is the first page with a 4 in the hundreds place, and it goes up to 488. So, that's correct, 89 times. So, adding that to the previous counts, the total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89). Let me add those up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, I need to do the same process for the digit 8. Let me start with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in each set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-10, it's at page 8, then 18, 28, and so on. \n\nAgain, there are 48 full sets of ten and a partial set of 8 pages (481-488). So, in each of the 48 full sets, that's 48 instances of 8 in the units place. Now, the last partial set is 481-488, which includes 488. So, looking at the units digit, 488 has an 8, so that's one more 8. Therefore, the total number of 8's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 can appear in the tens place, like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set. \n\nSo, each of these sets contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let me count how many full sets there are. From 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five sets, but the last one is only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in each of the first four sets, we have 10 8's in the tens place, and in the last set, we have 9 8's because 488 is the last page.\n\nWait, no, actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, the tens digit is 8 in all these numbers, right? Because the tens digit is the second digit from the right. So, 480 has 8 in the tens place, 481 has 8, and so on up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, for each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so that's 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, the last set, 480-488, contributes 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 800. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big difference. \n\nWait, for the tens place of 4's, I had 50, which came from 4 sets of 10 in each hundred (40-49, 140-149, etc.), which is 4 \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 10 more from 440-449, making 50. That seems correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place of 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48 full sets of ten (48 \u00d7 1 = 48) plus one more in 484, so 49.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor the 8's, units place: 48 full sets plus one in 488, so 49.\n\nTens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For example, in the hundreds place for 4's, I counted 89, but is that correct? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place for 8's, I had 49, which includes 4 sets of 10 (each contributing 10 8's) and one set of 9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place for both digits is 49 each, so that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full blocks of 10 (1-480), contributing 48 \u00d7 1 = 48.\n   - The last block (481-488) has one more 4 (at 484).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In every block of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).\n   - There are 4 full blocks of 100 (1-400), contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - The last partial block (401-488) includes 440-449, contributing another 10.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - From 400-488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - There are 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, every block of 10 contributes one 8.\n   - 48 full blocks + one in 488.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In every block of 100, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89).\n   - There are 4 full blocks (1-400), contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - The last partial block (401-488) includes 480-488, contributing 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I'll consider single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears exactly once, on page 4. So, that's one 4. Now, moving on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each two-digit number has a tens place and a units place. I'll need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place.\n\nFor the tens place, the numbers 40-49 all have a 4 in the tens digit. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of the digit 4. For the units place, the 4 appears once every ten numbers. So, in 10-19, it's 14; in 20-29, it's 24; and so on up to 90-99, which is 94. That's 9 occurrences in the units place. Wait, no, actually, from 10 to 99, there are 9 sets of ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), so that's 9 times where 4 appears in the units place. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers are 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. \n\nNow, adding the single-digit 4, the total number of 4's so far is 1 + 19 = 20. \n\nNext, I need to consider three-digit page numbers, which go from 100 to 488. Three-digit numbers have hundreds, tens, and units places. I'll break this down by each place.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place: In the range 100-488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, the hundreds digit is 4 only for numbers 400-488. Let me calculate how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, moving to the tens place for three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9, and I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488. \n\nFor each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). \n\nBut wait, for the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit can only go up to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 would appear in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 488 is the end, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's still 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each. So, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10 = 40 times. But wait, 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit 4 in 440-449 is still 10 numbers, so yes, 10 times. So, total 40 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nNext, the units place for three-digit numbers. Similarly, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, the units digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. Let me calculate how many times this happens.\n\nFrom 100-199: The units digit 4 appears in 104, 114, 124, ..., 194. That's 10 times. Similarly, 200-299: 204, 214, ..., 294: 10 times. 300-399: 304, 314, ..., 394: 10 times. Now, 400-488: The units digit 4 appears in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, let me count these. Starting from 404, each 10 numbers: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times because 494 would be beyond 488. So, 9 times in 400-488. \n\nSo, total units digit 4's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: From 100-399, each hundred contributes 10 units digit 4's, so 3*10=30. Then, 400-488 contributes 9, so total 39. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89+40=129, 129+39=168.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in hundreds place. Tens place: For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each, so 4*10=40. Units place: 100-399: 3 hundreds, each with 10, so 30. 400-488: 9, so 30+9=39. So, 89+40+39=168. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the units place for 400-488. Let me recount. From 400-488, the units digit 4 appears in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, yes, 39 units digit 4's in three-digit numbers.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n\nAdding the single and two-digit 4's: 20 + 168 = 188. So, total 4's printed are 188.\n\nNow, I need to count the number of 8's printed. Let's do the same approach.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: 1-9. The digit 8 appears once, on page 8.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: 10-99.\n\nFirst, the tens place: Numbers 80-89 have 8 in the tens digit, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: The digit 8 appears once every ten numbers. So, in 10-19: 18; 20-29:28; ... 90-99:98. That's 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nAdding the single-digit 8, total so far is 1 + 19 = 20.\n\nNow, three-digit numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1,2,3,4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place, so 0 occurrences.\n\nTens place: For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit 8 appears in the range x80-x89, where x is the hundreds digit. So, in each hundred, that's 10 numbers. So, for 100-199: 180-189, 10 numbers; 200-299: 280-289, 10; 300-399: 380-389, 10; 400-488: 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nWait, no, in the tens place, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens digit, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens digit 8's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) +10 (300-399) +9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nUnits place: The units digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, from 100-199: 108,118,...,198: 10 times. Similarly, 200-299: 208,...,298:10; 300-399:308,...,398:10. Now, 400-488: The units digit 8 appears in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total units digit 8's: 10 (100-199) +10 (200-299) +10 (300-399) +9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place (39) + units place (39) = 78.\n\nAdding the single and two-digit 8's: 20 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me verify that. Single-digit:1, two-digit:19, so 20. Three-digit: tens 39, units 39, total 78. So, 20+78=98.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the tens place for 400-488. Let me check again. The tens digit 8 in 400-488 would be 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences, correct. So, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39, correct.\n\nUnits place: Each hundred contributes 10, except 400-488 which contributes 9, so 3*10 +9=39, correct.\n\nSo, total 8's:20+78=98.\n\nWait, but let me recount the three-digit 8's. So, hundreds place:0, tens:39, units:39, total 78. Plus single and two-digit 8's:20. So, 98 total 8's.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit: tens 10 (40-49), units 9 (14,24,...,94) \u2192 total 19. So, 1+19=20.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds:400-488:89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTens: For each hundred, 10 times. 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:10 (440-449). So, 4*10=40.\n\nUnits: For each hundred, 10 times except 400-488, which is 9. So, 3*10=30, plus 9=39.\n\nTotal three-digit 4's:89+40+39=168.\n\nTotal 4's:20+168=188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit: tens 10 (80-89), units 9 (18,28,...,98) \u2192 total 19. So, 1+19=20.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nTens:100-199:10 (180-189), 200-299:10 (280-289), 300-399:10 (380-389), 400-488:9 (480-488). So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nUnits:100-199:10 (108,118,...,198), 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9 (408,418,...,488). So, 3*10=30 +9=39.\n\nTotal three-digit 8's:39+39=78.\n\nTotal 8's:20+78=98.\n\nSo, 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure if I counted correctly, especially in the three-digit numbers. Let me try another approach, perhaps using a formula or a different counting method to verify.\n\nAnother way to count digits is to consider each digit position separately and calculate how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor page numbers from 1 to n, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place can be calculated, and similarly for tens, hundreds, etc.\n\nLet me try this method for 4's and 8's.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\nUnits place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) + (if the last digit is >=4, add 1). Wait, no, more accurately, it's the number of complete decades plus the remainder if the last digit is >=4.\n\nSo, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 complete decades, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 in the units place. Plus, since the last digit is 8, which is >=4, we add 1 more. So, units digit 4's:48+1=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I counted 39 units digit 4's in three-digit numbers and 9 in two-digit, which totals 48. Hmm, but according to this formula, it's 49. Wait, perhaps I missed one. Let me check.\n\nWait, from 1 to 488, the units digit 4 appears in 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many numbers is that? Let's see, starting at 4, each 10 numbers. So, from 4 to 484, that's (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49 times. So, 49 units digit 4's. But earlier, I had 39 in three-digit and 9 in two-digit, which is 48. So, where is the discrepancy?\n\nAh, I think I missed the single-digit 4 in the units place when I was counting earlier. Wait, no, in the units digit, single-digit numbers are included. So, when I counted two-digit and three-digit, I included the units digit 4's in those ranges, but I think I missed the single-digit 4. Wait, no, in the initial count, I had single-digit 4's as 1, two-digit units 4's as 9, and three-digit units 4's as 39, totaling 1+9+39=49. So, that matches the formula. So, my initial count was correct.\n\nWait, but earlier, in the three-digit units digit, I had 39, which included 100-399:30 and 400-488:9, so 39. Then, two-digit units:9 (from 14,24,...,94). Single-digit:1 (page 4). So, total 39+9+1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for tens digit 4's:\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, from 1-488, how many hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. Wait, but the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49 (10 times), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and in 440-449 (10). But 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, total 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. But wait, 488 is less than 500, so 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10, so total 5*10=50. But earlier, I had 40 in three-digit numbers. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, in my initial count, I had for three-digit numbers:\n\nTens digit 4's:100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:10 (440-449). So, 4*10=40. But according to this, it's 5*10=50. Wait, perhaps I missed the two-digit tens digit 4's.\n\nWait, in two-digit numbers, 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 tens digit 4's. So, total tens digit 4's:10 (two-digit) +40 (three-digit) =50. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digit 4's: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 hundreds digit 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\nUnits digit 8's: From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Using the same method: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488's units digit is 8, which is >=8, we add 1. So, 48+1=49 units digit 8's.\n\nTens digit 8's: In each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). From 1-488, how many hundreds? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times, so 4*10=40. In 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total tens digit 8's:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds digit 8's: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so hundreds digit 8 never appears. So, 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I did the initial count, I had 98 8's, so this matches.\n\nWait, but earlier in my initial count, I had 20 (single and two-digit) +78 (three-digit) =98. So, that's consistent.\n\nSo, number of 4's:188, number of 8's:98. Difference:188-98=90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n\n   - **Single-digit (1-9):** The digit 4 appears once (page 4).\n\n   - **Two-digit (10-99):**\n     - **Tens place:** Pages 40-49 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - **Units place:** Pages 14, 24, ..., 94 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - **Total:** 10 + 9 = 19.\n\n   - **Three-digit (100-488):**\n     - **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n     - **Tens place:** In each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n     - **Units place:** Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences except 400-488, which contributes 9.

    "text": " \n\nFirst, for single-digit page numbers (1-9): The only single-digit number with a 4 is 4 itself. So, that's one occurrence of 4. \n\nNext, for two-digit page numbers (10-99): I need to consider both the tens place and the units place separately. \n\nIn the tens place: The numbers 40-49 all have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4. \n\nIn the units place: The numbers ending with 4 are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but 44 has a 4 in both tens and units place, so I should count each digit separately. So, from 10-99, how many numbers end with 4? Let's see, starting from 14, every 10 numbers, so 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, so does that mean I should count it twice? Hmm, I think yes, because each digit is counted separately. So, in the units place, 9 times, but 44 contributes an extra 4 in the tens place, which I've already counted. So, maybe I should just count the units place as 9 and the tens place as 10, so total 19 4's in two-digit numbers. Wait, but 44 is included in both, so maybe I'm double-counting. No, actually, when I count the tens place, I'm counting the 4 in the tens digit, and when I count the units place, I'm counting the 4 in the units digit. So, 44 has both, so it's correct to count both. So, total 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 4's in two-digit numbers. \n\nWait, but actually, from 10-99, the units place 4's are 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, but each contributes one 4 in the units place, so 9 occurrences. Similarly, the tens place 4's are 40-49, which is 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place, so 10 occurrences. So total 19 4's in two-digit numbers. \n\nNow, for three-digit page numbers (100-488): I need to consider hundreds, tens, and units places. \n\nIn the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for hundreds digit 4, the numbers are 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. Let me calculate that: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences of 4. \n\nIn the tens place: For three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 0-9, and the units digit can be 0-9. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? For each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, so in each hundred (e.g., 100-199, 200-299, etc.), the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). Now, since we're going up to 488, let's see how many full hundreds we have and if the last hundred is partial. \n\nFrom 100-399: There are 3 full hundreds. Each has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 3 * 10 = 30 occurrences. \n\nThen, from 400-488: The tens digit can be 0-8, because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 occurrences. \n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's in three-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 40 occurrences. \n\nWait, but let me check: From 100-399, each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, so 3 * 10 = 30. From 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 30 + 10 = 40. \n\nIn the units place: Similarly, for three-digit numbers, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Again, for each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9, so for each hundred, there are 10 numbers ending with 4 (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194 in 100-199). \n\nFrom 100-399: 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers ending with 4, so 3 * 10 = 30. \n\nFrom 400-488: The units digit 4 occurs in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, from 400-488, how many numbers end with 4? Let's see: starting at 404, then every 10 numbers, so 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 + 10 would be 494, which is beyond 488. So, 9 occurrences. \n\nSo, total units place 4's in three-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39. \n\nWait, but let me check again: From 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs at 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers. So, yes, 9. \n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place 89 + tens place 40 + units place 39 = 89 + 40 = 129 + 39 = 168. \n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check. \n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. \n\nIn the tens place, from 100-399, 3 hundreds, each with 10 numbers where tens digit is 4, so 30. From 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 30 + 10 = 40. \n\nIn the units place, from 100-399, 3 hundreds, each with 10 numbers ending with 4, so 30. From 400-488, numbers ending with 4 are 404,414,...,484, which is 9 numbers. So, 30 + 9 = 39. \n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. \n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1 + 19 = 20 + 168 = 188. \n\nWait, that seems a lot. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the three-digit numbers. \n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. \n\nIn the tens place: from 100-399, 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers with tens digit 4, so 30. From 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 30 + 10 = 40. \n\nIn the units place: from 100-399, 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers ending with 4, so 30. From 400-488, numbers ending with 4 are from 404 to 484, stepping by 10. Let's count them: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers. So, 30 + 9 = 39. \n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. \n\nAdding the single-digit and two-digit: 1 + 19 = 20. So, total 4's: 20 + 168 = 188. \n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. \n\nStarting with single-digit: page 8 is the only single-digit number with an 8, so 1 occurrence. \n\nTwo-digit numbers (10-99): \n\nIn the tens place: 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. \n\nIn the units place: numbers ending with 8 are 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 9 occurrences. \n\nBut wait, 88 has two 8's, so does that mean I'm double-counting? No, because in the tens place, I counted the 8 in the tens digit, and in the units place, I'm counting the 8 in the units digit. So, 88 contributes one 8 in each place, so it's correct to count both. \n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. \n\nNow, three-digit numbers (100-488): \n\nIn the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1,2,3,4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the hundreds digits are only up to 4. So, 0 occurrences. \n\nIn the tens place: For three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 0-9. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? \n\nFrom 100-399: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, etc.). So, 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers, so 3*10=30. \n\nFrom 400-488: The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 only for 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences. \n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with tens digit 8. So, 9 occurrences. \n\nSo, total tens place 8's in three-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39. \n\nIn the units place: For three-digit numbers, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? \n\nFrom 100-399: Each hundred has 10 numbers ending with 8 (e.g., 108,118,...,198 in 100-199). So, 3 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 3*10=30. \n\nFrom 400-488: Numbers ending with 8 are 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers. \n\nSo, total units place 8's in three-digit numbers: 30 + 9 = 39. \n\nNow, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place 39 + units place 39 = 78. \n\nAdding single-digit and two-digit: single-digit 1 + two-digit 19 = 20. \n\nTotal 8's: 20 + 78 = 98. \n\nWait, but let me check the three-digit numbers again. \n\nIn the hundreds place, 8 doesn't appear, so 0. \n\nIn the tens place: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39. \n\nIn the units place: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39. \n\nSo, 39 + 39 = 78. \n\nAdding single-digit and two-digit: 1 + 19 = 20. \n\nTotal 8's: 20 + 78 = 98. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the three-digit units place for 8's. From 400-488, numbers ending with 8 are 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers. So, yes, 9. \n\nSo, total 8's: 98. \n\nNow, total 4's: 188. \n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nWait, but let me double-check everything because this seems like a lot. \n\nWait, 4's: single-digit 1, two-digit 19, three-digit 168. 1+19=20, 20+168=188. \n\n8's: single-digit 1, two-digit 19, three-digit 78. 1+19=20, 20+78=98. \n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nHmm, seems correct. \n\nWait, but let me check the three-digit 4's again. \n\nIn hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. \n\nIn tens place: 100-399: 3*10=30. 400-488: 10 (440-449). So, 40. \n\nIn units place: 100-399: 3*10=30. 400-488: 9 numbers. So, 39. \n\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nAnd for 8's, three-digit: tens place 39, units place 39. 78. \n\nYes. \n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nTherefore, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits '4' and '8' in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Single-digit (1-9):** Only page 4 has a '4' \u2192 1 occurrence.\n2. **Two-digit (10-99):**\n   - Tens place: Pages 40-49 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n   - Units place: Pages 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n3. **Three-digit (100-488):**\n   - Hundreds place: Pages 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n   - Tens place: \n     - 100-399: Each hundred contributes 10 '4's in the tens place \u2192 3\u00d710=30.\n     - 400-488: Pages 440-449 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Total: 30 + 10 = 40.\n   - Units place:\n     - 100-399: Each hundred contributes 10 '4's in the units place \u2192 3\u00d710=30.\n     - 400-488: Pages 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total: 30 + 9 = 39.\n   - Total for three-digit: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n4. **Total 4's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Single-digit (1-9):** Only page 8 has an '8' \u2192 1 occurrence.\n2. **Two-digit (10-99):**\n   - Tens place: Pages 80-89 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n   - Units place: Pages 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n3. **Three-digit (100-488):**\n   - Hundreds place: No '8's since the hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3, or 4 \u2192 0.\n   - Tens place:\n     - 100-399: Each hundred contributes 10 '8's in the tens place \u2192 3\u00d710=30.\n     - 400-488: Pages 480-488 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total: 30 + 9 = 39.\n   - Units place:\n     - 100-399: Each hundred contributes 10 '8's in the units place \u2192 3\u00d710=30.\n     - 400-488: Pages 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total: 30 + 9 = 39.\n   - Total for three-digit: 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n4. **Total 8's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, for the single-digit page numbers (1-9), the only occurrence of 4 is on page 4. So that's one 4. Now, moving on to two-digit page numbers (10-99). Here, the digits can be in the tens place or the units place. Let me separate these. For the tens place, the pages from 40 to 49 will have a 4 in the tens digit. That's 10 pages, so 10 occurrences of 4. For the units place, the 4 will appear in 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but from 10 to 99, that's 90 numbers. So, the 4 in the units place occurs once every 10 numbers, so 9 times? Wait, no, from 10 to 99, the units digits cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, for each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, etc.), there's one 4 in the units place. Since there are 9 such groups (10-99), that's 9 occurrences. But wait, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4, so in the units place, 44 would have been counted twice, but I think when counting digits, each occurrence is counted separately, so 44 would have two 4's. So, in the two-digit numbers, the tens place contributes 10 4's, and the units place contributes 9 4's, but wait, let me check: from 10-99, how many 4's in the units place? It's 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90. Wait, no, that's the tens place. For units, it's 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 9 occurrences. Wait, but from 10-99, that's 90 numbers, so 9 groups of 10. Each group has one 4 in the units place, so 9 times. So, units place: 9 4's, tens place: 10 4's (40-49). So total for two-digit numbers: 9 + 10 = 19 4's. But wait, 44 is counted in both tens and units, so that's two 4's in that number. So, the total 4's in two-digit numbers are 19. Now, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100-488. This is a bit more complex. Let me break it down by hundreds, tens, and units places. \n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But for 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so any page number from 400 to 488 will have a 4 in the hundreds place. The number of pages from 400 to 488 is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, let's look at the tens place. In the tens place, a 4 can appear in various hundreds. So, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), we can check how many times 4 appears in the tens place. \n\nIn 100-199: The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in 140-149, the tens digit is 4. That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. Similarly, in 200-299: 240-249, another 10 4's. In 300-399: 340-349, another 10 4's. Now, in 400-488: The tens digit can be 0-8. So, the 4 in the tens place would be 440-449. That's 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 4's. So, total 4's in the tens place across all three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 4's in the tens place. \n\nNow, the units place. Again, for each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, in 100-199, the units digit is 4 in 104,114,124,134,144,154,164,174,184,194. That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the units place. Similarly, in 200-299: 204,214,...,294: another 10. In 300-399: 304,314,...,394: another 10. In 400-488: The units digit is 4 in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Wait, but 484 is within 488, so that's 9 numbers. Wait, let me check: from 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs at 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. So, 9 4's in the units place for 400-488. So, total units place 4's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 4's in the units place. \n\nSo, adding up all the 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place 89 + tens place 40 + units place 39 = 89 + 40 = 129 + 39 = 168 4's. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Hundreds place: 89 (from 400-488). Tens place: 10+10+10+10=40. Units place: 10+10+10+9=39. So total 4's: 89+40+39=168. That seems correct. \n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the page numbers. \n\nStarting with single-digit pages (1-9): the only 8 is on page 8. So that's one 8. \n\nTwo-digit pages (10-99): similar approach. Tens place and units place. \n\nTens place: 80-89 have 8 in the tens digit. That's 10 pages, so 10 8's. \n\nUnits place: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 9 8's. \n\nWait, but 88 has both tens and units as 8, so that's two 8's in that number, but when counting digits, each occurrence is counted separately. So, the units place contributes 9 8's, and the tens place contributes 10 8's. So total for two-digit numbers: 10 + 9 = 19 8's. \n\nNow, three-digit pages (100-488). Let's break this down. \n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, 8 in the hundreds place would only occur in 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 8's. \n\nTens place: For each hundred, the tens digit can be 8. Let's see:\n\nIn 100-199: 180-189 have 8 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\nIn 200-299: 280-289: another 10 8's.\n\nIn 300-399: 380-389: another 10 8's.\n\nIn 400-488: The tens digit can be 8 in 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 8's in the tens place for 400-488. \n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 (100-199) +10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+9 (400-488)=39 8's in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: For each hundred, the units digit is 8 in numbers like 108,118,...,198; 208,218,...,298; 308,318,...,398; and in 408,418,...,488. Let's count them:\n\nIn 100-199: The units digit is 8 in 108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\nIn 200-299: Similarly, 208,218,...,298: 10 numbers, 10 8's.\n\nIn 300-399: 308,318,...,398: 10 numbers, 10 8's.\n\nIn 400-488: The units digit is 8 in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is the last one. So, 9 8's.\n\nSo, total units place 8's: 10+10+10+9=39 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place 39 + units place 39 = 78 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Tens place: 10+10+10+9=39. Units place: 10+10+10+9=39. So, 39+39=78 8's in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) = 1 + 19 = 20 + 78 = 98 8's.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. Single-digit: 1. Two-digit: 19. Three-digit: 78. So total 8's: 1+19=20; 20+78=98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, total 4's: 168 (from earlier). Total 8's: 98. So, the difference is 168 - 98 = 70. So, there are 70 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1.\n\nTwo-digit: tens place 10 (40-49), units place 9 (14,24,...,94). Total: 19.\n\nThree-digit: hundreds place 89 (400-488), tens place 40 (140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), units place 39 (104,114,...,194; 204,...,294; 304,...,394; 404,...,484). So, 89+40+39=168. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1.\n\nTwo-digit: tens place 10 (80-89), units place 9 (18,28,...,98). Total:19.\n\nThree-digit: tens place 39 (180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488), units place 39 (108,...,198; 208,...,298; 308,...,398; 408,...,488). So, 39+39=78.\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nSo, difference: 168-98=70. Therefore, 70 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 168, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 70.\n\n\\boxed{70}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let's look at single-digit page numbers: 1 to 9. The only single-digit number with a 4 is 4 itself. So, that's one 4. Now, moving on to two-digit numbers: 10 to 99. In two-digit numbers, the digits can be in the tens place or the units place. So, I'll need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers from 40 to 49 all have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 fours. \n\nFor the units place: The numbers where the units digit is 4 are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but we're only going up to 99, so that's 9 numbers. But wait, 44 has two 4's, but since I'm counting each occurrence, I think I should count each 4 separately. So, from 10 to 99, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 9 times (from 14 to 94). But wait, 44 would have two 4's, so that's an extra one. So, 10 times? Wait, no, from 10 to 99, the units digit cycles every 10, so for each ten, there's one 4 in the units place. There are 9 tens (10-99), so 9 times. But wait, 44 is in the 40s, so that's included in the tens place count. So, for units place, it's 9 fours. So, in two-digit numbers, 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 fours. \n\nWait, but when I think about it, from 10 to 99, the units digit cycles 0-9 nine times (since 10 to 99 is 90 numbers, 9 sets of 10). So, each digit from 0-9 appears 9 times in the units place. So, 4 appears 9 times in the units place. Similarly, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (40-49). So, total fours in two-digit numbers: 10 + 9 = 19. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers: 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because now we have hundreds, tens, and units places. Let me break this down by each digit place. \n\nFirst, the hundreds place: From 100 to 399, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3. So, 4 doesn't appear in the hundreds place here. From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. \n\nNext, the tens place: I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place in three-digit numbers. Let's consider each hundred separately. \n\n- For 100-199: The tens digit can be 0-9. So, 4 in the tens place occurs in 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 fours. \n- For 200-299: Similarly, 240-249, another 10 fours. \n- For 300-399: 340-349, another 10 fours. \n- For 400-488: The tens digit can be 0-8. So, 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so 10 fours. \n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so when considering 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 440-449 is okay. So, in each hundred, 10 fours in the tens place, and there are four hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is not a full hundred, it's 89 numbers. But for the tens place, the 400-488 range still includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total fours in the tens place across all three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 fours. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. For each hundred, like 100-199, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. Since there are four hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), that's 4 times 10, which is 40 fours in the tens place across all three-digit numbers. \n\nNow, the units place for three-digit numbers: Similarly, in each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, in each hundred, 4 appears once in the units place for each ten. There are 10 tens in a hundred, so 10 fours per hundred in the units place. But wait, actually, for each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 ten times, so 4 appears 10 times in the units place per hundred. \n\nSo, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), how many fours in the units place? \n\n- 100-199: 10 fours (104, 114, ..., 194)\n- 200-299: 10 fours\n- 300-399: 10 fours\n- 400-488: Now, here, the units digit goes up to 8, so the last number is 488. So, the units digit 4 would be in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, right? Because 404 is the first, then every 10 after that, up to 484. So, that's 9 fours. \n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so from 400 to 488, the units digit 4 occurs 9 times. So, in the units place, for three-digit numbers, we have 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 fours. \n\nWait, let me check that again. For 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs at 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 fours. So, total units place fours in three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 fours. \n\nNow, adding up all the fours in three-digit numbers: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89 + 40 = 129 + 39 = 168 fours. \n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check. \n\nWait, the hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. \n\nTens place: 10 in each of the first three hundreds, and 10 in 400-488, so 4 x 10 = 40. \n\nUnits place: 10 in each of the first three hundreds, and 9 in 400-488, so 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. \n\nSo, total fours in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. \n\nNow, adding the single-digit and two-digit numbers: single-digit had 1 four, two-digit had 19 fours, so total fours up to two digits: 1 + 19 = 20. \n\nSo, total fours in the entire book: 20 (from 1-99) + 168 (from 100-488) = 188 fours. \n\nWait, but let me check that again. Wait, 1-9: 1 four. 10-99: 19 fours. 100-488: 168 fours. So, 1 + 19 = 20, plus 168 is 188. \n\nNow, I need to count the number of 8's in the same way. Let's do that now. \n\nStarting with single-digit numbers: 1-9. The only single-digit 8 is 8 itself, so that's one 8. \n\nTwo-digit numbers: 10-99. Again, counting 8's in tens and units places. \n\nTens place: 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 eights. \n\nUnits place: The numbers where the units digit is 8 are 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 numbers, but 88 has two 8's, so each occurrence is counted separately. So, 9 eights in the units place. \n\nSo, total eights in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 eights. \n\nNow, three-digit numbers: 100-488. Let's break this down by each digit place. \n\nHundreds place: From 100-399, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3, so no 8's. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. \n\nTens place: Now, let's look at each hundred separately. \n\n- 100-199: The tens digit is 8 in 180-189. That's 10 numbers, so 10 eights. \n- 200-299: Similarly, 280-289: 10 eights. \n- 300-399: 380-389: 10 eights. \n- 400-488: The tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. \n\nSo, total eights in the tens place across three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 eights. \n\nUnits place: Now, let's count eights in the units place for three-digit numbers. \n\n- 100-199: The units digit is 8 in 108, 118, 128, 138, 148, 158, 168, 178, 188, 198. That's 10 eights. \n- 200-299: Similarly, 208, 218, ..., 298: 10 eights. \n- 300-399: 308, 318, ..., 398: 10 eights. \n- 400-488: The units digit is 8 in 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 eights because 488 is included. \n\nSo, total eights in the units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 eights. \n\nNow, adding up all the eights in three-digit numbers: tens place (39) + units place (39) = 78 eights. \n\nWait, but let me confirm: hundreds place has 0, tens place 39, units place 39, so total eights in three-digit numbers: 39 + 39 = 78. \n\nNow, adding up all the eights: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) = 1 + 19 = 20 + 78 = 98 eights. \n\nWait, that seems off because when I added fours, I got 188 fours and 98 eights, so the difference would be 90. But let me double-check my counts because that seems like a big difference. \n\nWait, let me go through the counts again more carefully. \n\nStarting with fours: \n\n- Single-digit: 1 (page 4)\n- Two-digit: tens place (40-49: 10) + units place (14,24,...,94: 9) = 19\n- Three-digit: hundreds place (400-488: 89) + tens place (10+10+10+10=40) + units place (10+10+10+9=39) = 89+40+39=168\n- Total fours: 1+19+168=188\n\nNow, eights: \n\n- Single-digit: 1 (page 8)\n- Two-digit: tens place (80-89:10) + units place (18,28,...,98:9) =19\n- Three-digit: hundreds place:0\n  - Tens place: 100-199 (180-189:10) + 200-299 (280-289:10) + 300-399 (380-389:10) + 400-488 (480-488:9) = 10+10+10+9=39\n  - Units place: 100-199 (108,118,...,198:10) + 200-299 (208,218,...,298:10) + 300-399 (308,318,...,398:10) + 400-488 (408,418,...,488:9) =10+10+10+9=39\n- Total eights: 1+19+39+39=98\n\nSo, total fours:188, total eights:98. Difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in the three-digit tens place for fours. Earlier, I thought that in 400-488, the tens place 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 10 fours in the tens place for 400-488. So, 10+10+10+10=40 in the tens place for three-digit numbers. \n\nSimilarly, for units place in three-digit numbers, in 400-488, units digit 4 occurs at 404,414,...,484, which is 9 times because 484 is the last one before 488. So, that's 9 fours. So, 10+10+10+9=39 in the units place. \n\nSo, 89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units)=168 fours in three-digit numbers. \n\nFor eights, in three-digit numbers, tens place:10+10+10+9=39, units place:10+10+10+9=39, so total 78 eights in three-digit numbers. \n\nAdding single and two-digit eights:1+19=20, plus 78=98 eights. \n\nSo, 188 fours -98 eights=90. \n\nWait, but let me check if I missed any eights in the three-digit numbers. For example, in 400-488, when counting units place, I included 488, which is correct. Similarly, in tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. \n\nSo, yes, the counts seem correct. Therefore, the number of fours printed is 90 more than the number of eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 4 has a '4', so 1 occurrence.\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - Tens place: Pages 40-49 (10 occurrences).\n   - Units place: Pages 14, 24, ..., 94 (9 occurrences).\n   - Total: 10 + 9 = 19 occurrences.\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - Hundreds place: Pages 400-488 (89 occurrences).\n   - Tens place: Each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has 10 occurrences, and 400-488 has 10 (440-449).

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9): The only single-digit page number that has a 4 is page 4. So, that's one 4. Now, moving on to two-digit page numbers (10-99). Here, a two-digit number can have a 4 in the tens place or the units place. Let me consider each case separately. \n\nFirst, the tens place: If the tens digit is 4, then the page numbers are 40-49. That's 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. So, that's 10 fours. \n\nNext, the units place: For the units digit being 4, the possible page numbers are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but since we're only going up to 99, 44 is included, but 104 isn't yet. So, how many numbers is that? Let's see: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, each with a 4 in the units place. Wait, but 44 has a 4 in both places, so I need to make sure I'm not double-counting. But when counting digits, each occurrence is counted separately, so even though 44 has two 4's, each is counted once. So, for the units place, it's 9 fours. So, in two-digit numbers, the number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 fours. \n\nWait, but hold on, from 10-99, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each ten's place (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the units digit 4 appears once. There are 9 ten's places (10-99), so 9 times. But wait, 40-49 is the ten's place with 4, so that's 10 numbers, but in the units place, we're considering 14,24,...,94, which is 9 numbers. So, 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 fours in two-digit numbers. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Let's break this down into hundreds, tens, and units places. \n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since we're going up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\nFor the hundreds digit being 4: Pages 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. Each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. \n\nNow, the tens place in three-digit numbers: We need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place from 100-488. \n\nLet me think: For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 pages. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.), except for the last hundred, 400-488, where the tens digit goes up to 8. \n\nWait, let me clarify. For 100-199: Tens digit 4 occurs in 140-149, which is 10 pages. Similarly, for 200-299: 240-249, 10 pages. For 300-399: 340-349, 10 pages. For 400-488: The tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 pages. So, each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. There are four hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), so 4 * 10 = 40 fours in the tens place. \n\nWait, but 400-488: The tens digit goes up to 8, but 440-449 is still within 488, so yes, 10 fours there. So, total tens place fours: 40. \n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers: Similarly, for each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 pages. So, in each hundred, the units digit 4 appears once every 10 pages, so 10 times per hundred. \n\nSo, for 100-199: Units digit 4 appears in 104,114,...,194. That's 10 numbers. Similarly, 200-299: 204,214,...,294: 10 numbers. 300-399: 304,314,...,394: 10 numbers. 400-488: 404,414,...,484. Wait, how many is that? Let's see: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. So, in 400-488, the units digit 4 appears 9 times. \n\nSo, total units digit fours in three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 fours. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. For 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs at 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, correct. So, total units digit fours: 10+10+10+9=39. \n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, the number of fours is hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89+40=129+39=168 fours. \n\nWait, but hold on. Let me add that again: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) = 129, plus 39 (units) is 168. So, 168 fours in three-digit numbers. \n\nNow, adding up all fours: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1+19=20+168=188 fours. \n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting. \n\nWait, in single-digit, it's 1 four. In two-digit, tens place: 10 fours (40-49), units place: 9 fours (14,24,...,94). So, 10+9=19, correct. So, 1+19=20 fours up to page 99. \n\nNow, in three-digit numbers, from 100-488. \n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, each with a 4 in hundreds place, so 89 fours. \n\nTens place: For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 10 numbers each, so 4*10=40 fours. \n\nUnits place: For 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each have 10 fours in units place, and 400-488 has 9 fours. So, 10+10+10+9=39 fours. \n\nSo, total in three-digit: 89+40+39=168 fours. \n\nTotal fours: 20 (from 1-99) +168=188 fours. \n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9): The only single-digit page number with an 8 is page 8. So, that's one 8. \n\nTwo-digit page numbers (10-99): Let's count the number of 8's in tens and units places. \n\nTens place: If the tens digit is 8, then the page numbers are 80-89. That's 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, 10 eights. \n\nUnits place: For the units digit being 8, the possible page numbers are 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the units place. \n\nWait, but 88 has an 8 in both places, so when counting digits, each occurrence is counted separately. So, for the units place, it's 9 eights. \n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, the number of 8's is 10 (tens) +9 (units)=19 eights. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers (100-488). \n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, the hundreds digit 8 doesn't appear because 800 is beyond 488. So, no eights in the hundreds place. \n\nTens place: Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place from 100-488. \n\nFor each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 10 numbers each. \n\nSo, 100-199: 180-189, 10 numbers. \n\n200-299: 280-289, 10 numbers. \n\n300-399: 380-389, 10 numbers. \n\n400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 480,481,...,488: 9 numbers. \n\nSo, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+9=39 eights. \n\nUnits place: Now, counting how many times 8 appears in the units place from 100-488. \n\nFor each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the units digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. \n\nSo, 100-199: 108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198: 10 numbers. \n\n200-299: 208,218,...,298: 10 numbers. \n\n300-399: 308,318,...,398: 10 numbers. \n\n400-488: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488: 9 numbers (since 488 is included). \n\nSo, units place eights: 10+10+10+9=39 eights. \n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, the number of eights is tens place (39) + units place (39) =78 eights. \n\nAdding up all eights: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) =1+19=20+78=98 eights. \n\nWait, that seems correct. \n\nSo, total fours: 188 \n\nTotal eights: 98 \n\nDifference: 188 -98=90 \n\nWait, so there are 90 more fours than eights. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFirst, fours: \n\nSingle-digit:1 \n\nTwo-digit:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19 \n\nThree-digit:89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units)=168 \n\nTotal fours:1+19+168=188 \n\nEights: \n\nSingle-digit:1 \n\nTwo-digit:10 (tens)+9 (units)=19 \n\nThree-digit:39 (tens)+39 (units)=78 \n\nTotal eights:1+19+78=98 \n\nDifference:188-98=90 \n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the three-digit counts. Let me check again. \n\nIn three-digit numbers, hundreds place fours: pages 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 fours. \n\nTens place fours: For each hundred, 10 numbers with 4 in tens place, so 4 hundreds, 4*10=40 fours. \n\nUnits place fours: 10 per hundred for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 9 for 400-488, so 10+10+10+9=39 fours. \n\nSo, 89+40+39=168 fours in three-digit numbers. \n\nEights in three-digit numbers: \n\nTens place: 10 per hundred for 100-199,200-299,300-399, and 9 for 400-488, so 10+10+10+9=39 eights. \n\nUnits place: Similarly, 10 per hundred for 100-199,200-299,300-399, and 9 for 400-488, so 10+10+10+9=39 eights. \n\nSo, 39+39=78 eights in three-digit numbers. \n\nYes, that seems correct. \n\nSo, total fours:188 \n\nTotal eights:98 \n\nDifference:90 \n\nTherefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n**Counting the number of '4's:**\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - Only page 4 has a '4'.\n   - Total: 1\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** Pages 40-49 have '4' in the tens place: 10 occurrences.\n   - **Units place:** Pages 14, 24, ..., 94 have '4' in the units place: 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 10 + 9 = 19\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 have '4' in the hundreds place: 89 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), '4' appears in the tens place 10 times each, except the last hundred where it appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - Total: 4 * 10 = 40\n   - **Units place:** For each hundred, '4' appears in the units place 10 times, except the last hundred where it appears 9 times (404, 414, ..., 484).\n     - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n   - Total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n\n**Total '4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\n**Counting the number of '8's:**\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - Only page 8 has an '8'.\n   - Total: 1\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** Pages 80-89 have '8' in the tens place: 10 occurrences.\n   - **Units place:** Pages 18, 28, ..., 98 have '8' in the units place: 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 10 + 9 = 19\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** No '8's since the hundreds digit only goes up to 4.\n   - **Tens place:** For each hundred, '8' appears in the tens place 10 times, except the last hundred where it appears 9 times (480-488).\n     - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n   - **Units place:** For each hundred, '8' appears in the units place 10 times, except the last hundred where it appears 9 times (408, 418, ..., 488).\n     - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n   - Total: 39 + 39 = 78\n\n**Total '8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's than '8's printed in the book.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten pages, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14; and so on. Now, how many such sets are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 extra pages. So, in each of the 48 full sets, there's one 4 in the units place. That gives me 48 fours. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 will have a 4 in the units place. That's one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten pages. For example, in 40-49, every page number has a 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So, from 1-100, there's one block (40-49), from 101-200 another block (140-149), and so on. Let me calculate how many hundreds are there. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds and then 88 pages. So, in each hundred, there's one block of ten where the tens digit is 4. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 0-8. So, the block 440-449 would have the tens digit as 4. That's another 10 fours. So, adding that, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, hold on, let me check that again. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the next block would be 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So, total 40 + 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. How many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. The hundreds digit is 4 only for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages, but each of those pages has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. So, total fours in hundreds place: 89.\n\nWait, but hold on, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me add up all the fours: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits: 49\nTens: 50\nHundreds: 89\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nHmm, wait, let me double-check that addition. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, I need to count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Let me do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with units place: Similar to the 4's, in each set of ten, the digit 8 appears once. So, up to 488, how many sets of ten are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets and 8 extra pages. So, in each of the 48 sets, one 8 in the units place, so 48 eights. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so page 488 has an 8 in the units place. That's one more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten pages, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Let's count how many such blocks there are up to 488. Each hundred has one such block. From 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, so 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights. So, 4 * 10 = 40 eights. Then, from 401-488, the next block would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that block is only 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 9 times here. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me make sure. From 1-400, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these is 10 pages, so 4 blocks, 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480 to 488 inclusive). So, 9 eights. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 49 + 49 is 98, but let me check again. Units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0, so yes, 98 eights.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I calculated the number of 4's, I got 188, and for 8's, I have 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me go through the 4's again.\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has one block of ten where the tens digit is 4, so 4 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 pages, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, for the 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each with one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), units digit 8 appears once (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has one block of ten where the tens digit is 8, so 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488). So, 9 eights. Thus, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: No 8's, as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 fours minus 98 eights, which equals 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For example, in the tens place for 8's, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 eights. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's in the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 fours.\n\nYes, that adds up. So, I think the calculations are correct. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, for single-digit page numbers (1-9), the only occurrence of 4 is on page 4. So, that's 1 four. \n\nNext, for two-digit numbers (10-99), I can think of each page number as having a tens place and a units place. I'll need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. \n\nIn the tens place, the numbers from 40 to 49 all have 4 in the tens digit. That's 10 numbers, so 10 fours. \n\nIn the units place, the numbers ending with 4 are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, and 94. Wait, but since we're only going up to 99, 94 is the last one. Let me count: 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, so 9 fours. But wait, 44 has two fours, so I might have double-counted. No, actually, when I'm counting digits, each occurrence is counted separately, so 44 would contribute two fours. But in my initial count, I included 44 in both the tens and units place counts, so that's correct. So, in the units place, it's 9 fours. So total for two-digit numbers is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 fours. But wait, 44 is in both, so does that mean I'm counting it twice? Yes, because 44 has two fours, so that's correct. So, 19 fours in two-digit numbers.\n\nWait, let me double-check. From 10-99, the tens digits go from 1 to 9. For tens digit 4, that's 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. For units digit 4, it's every 10 numbers, so 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4, so 9 fours. So total is 10 + 9 = 19 fours in two-digit numbers. That seems right.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers, which are from 100 to 488. So, each page number here is a three-digit number, say ABC, where A is the hundreds digit, B is the tens digit, and C is the units digit. I'll need to count how many times 4 appears in each position (hundreds, tens, units) across all three-digit page numbers.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, for hundreds digit 4, the numbers are from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nNext, the tens place. For the tens digit, I need to consider each possible hundreds digit and see how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nFor hundreds digit 1: The tens digit can be 0-9, so numbers 100-199. How many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? It's from 140-149, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digits 2, 3, and 4: Each will have a block where the tens digit is 4, so 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 10 fours each. So, that's 3 more sets of 10, totaling 30 fours.\n\nWait, but the book only goes up to 488, so for hundreds digit 4, the tens digit goes up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for hundreds digit 4, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, when the tens digit is 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, that's correct. So, total for tens place across all hundreds digits is 10 (for hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 10 (hundreds 4) = 40 fours.\n\nWait, but when hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can only go up to 8, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's okay. So, 40 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, the units place. Again, considering each hundreds digit:\n\nFor hundreds digit 1: The units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens digit. So, for each tens digit, there's one number ending with 4. So, from 100-199, how many numbers end with 4? That's 104,114,124,...,194. That's 10 numbers, so 10 fours.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digits 2, 3, and 4: Each will have 10 numbers ending with 4 in their respective ranges. So, 204,214,...,294; 304,314,...,394; and 404,414,...,484. Wait, but 484 is within 400-488, but 494 would be beyond 488, so for hundreds digit 4, the units digit 4 occurs only up to 484, which is 9 times? Wait, no, let me think. From 400-488, how many numbers end with 4? It's 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 404 is the first and 484 is the last, each 10 apart, so (484 - 404)/10 +1 = 9 numbers. So, for hundreds digit 4, units digit 4 occurs 9 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought for hundreds digits 1,2,3, each would have 10 fours in the units place. Let me confirm:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 104,114,124,...,194: 10 numbers.\n- Hundreds digit 2: 204,214,...,294: 10 numbers.\n- Hundreds digit 3: 304,314,...,394: 10 numbers.\n- Hundreds digit 4: 404,414,...,484: 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total units digit fours: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 fours.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. For hundreds digit 4, the units digit 4 occurs in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 404 is the first and 484 is the last, and each step is 10, so (484 - 404)/10 +1 = 9. So, yes, 9 fours.\n\nSo, total units digit fours: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, the number of fours is:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 40\n- Units place: 39\nTotal fours: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. So, 168 fours in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, adding up all fours from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal fours: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, single-digit: 1 four (page 4).\n\nTwo-digit: 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 fours.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n- Tens place: For each hundreds digit 1-4, 10 fours each, so 4*10=40.\n- Units place: For hundreds digits 1-3, 10 each, so 3*10=30; for hundreds digit 4, 9 fours. So total units place: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nAdding up: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188 fours.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with single-digit numbers (1-9): only page 8, so 1 eight.\n\nTwo-digit numbers (10-99):\n\n- Tens place: numbers 80-89 have 8 in the tens place, which is 10 numbers, so 10 eights.\n- Units place: numbers ending with 8 are 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8. But 88 has two 8's, so in units place, it's 9 eights, but 88 is counted once here and once in tens place.\n\nSo, total two-digit eights: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 eights.\n\nWait, but 88 is in both, so does that mean we're counting it twice? Yes, because 88 has two 8's, so that's correct. So, 19 eights in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, three-digit numbers (100-488):\n\nAgain, considering hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. Only when hundreds digit is 8 would there be 8's in the hundreds place, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, no eights in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: For each hundreds digit, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nFor hundreds digit 1: 180-189, which is 10 numbers, so 10 eights.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digits 2,3,4: Each would have a block where the tens digit is 8, so 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for hundreds digit 4, the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place eights:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 10\n- Hundreds digits 2,3: 10 each, so 20\n- Hundreds digit 4: 9\nTotal: 10 + 20 + 9 = 39 eights.\n\nUnits place: For each hundreds digit, how many times does 8 appear in the units place.\n\nFor hundreds digit 1: Numbers ending with 8 are 108,118,...,198. That's 10 numbers, so 10 eights.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digits 2,3,4: Each will have 10 numbers ending with 8, except for hundreds digit 4, which might be limited.\n\nWait, for hundreds digit 4, units digit 8 occurs in 408,418,...,488. Let's see: from 400-488, the numbers ending with 8 are 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, for hundreds digit 4, units digit 8 occurs 9 times.\n\nSo, total units place eights:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 10\n- Hundreds digits 2,3: 10 each, so 20\n- Hundreds digit 4: 9\nTotal: 10 + 20 + 9 = 39 eights.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, the number of eights is:\n\n- Tens place: 39\n- Units place: 39\nTotal eights: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nAdding up all eights from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal eights: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Single-digit: 1. Two-digit: 10 (tens) +9 (units)=19. Three-digit: tens place 39, units place 39, total 78. So, 1+19=20, plus 78 is 98. Yes, that seems right.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me recount the fours:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 4).\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place: 40-49: 10 fours.\n- Units place: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94: 9 numbers, but 44 has two fours, so units place contributes 9 fours, but 44 is counted once in tens and once in units, so total fours in two-digit numbers: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 fours.\n- Tens place: For hundreds digits 1-4, each has 10 fours in tens place except for hundreds digit 4, which has 10 (since 440-449 is within 400-488). Wait, earlier I thought it was 10 for each, so 4*10=40. So, 40 fours in tens place.\n- Units place: For hundreds digits 1-3, 10 each, so 30; for hundreds digit 4, 9 fours, so total 39.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 fours in three-digit numbers.\n\nTotal fours: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nEights:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 8).\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place: 80-89: 10 eights.\n- Units place: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98: 9 numbers, but 88 has two eights, so units place contributes 9 eights, but 88 is counted once in tens and once in units, so total eights in two-digit numbers: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Tens place: For hundreds digits 1-4, each has 10 eights in tens place except for hundreds digit 4, which has 9 (480-488). So, 10 (hundreds 1) +10 (2)+10 (3)+9 (4) = 39 eights.\n- Units place: For hundreds digits 1-3, 10 each, so 30; for hundreds digit 4, 9 eights, so total 39.\n\nSo, 39 + 39 = 78 eights in three-digit numbers.\n\nTotal eights: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. In the three-digit numbers, for hundreds digit 4, the tens place goes up to 8, but when counting the tens place eights, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 488 is the last page. So, that part is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for units place in three-digit numbers, hundreds digit 4 ends at 488, so units digit 8 occurs 9 times, which is correct.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so 188 - 98 = 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra pages. So, in each block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Plus, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a block of 10 pages every 100 pages. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, that's 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, in the last partial hundred (from 400-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 400-409, which is another 10 pages. So, actually, it's 5 times 10, which is 50. Wait, no, because 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds go up to 400-499, but we only go up to 488. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 is in 400-409, which is 10 pages, and then 410-419, etc., but wait, no, the tens digit is 4 only in 400-409, right? Because 410-419 would have a tens digit of 1, not 4. Wait, no, that's not right. The tens digit cycles every 100. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 occurs once every 100 pages, specifically in the 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, from 1-488, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? Let's see: 40-49: 10 times, 140-149: 10 times, 240-249: 10 times, 340-349: 10 times, and 440-449: 10 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks of 10 pages each, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. So, the tens digit 4 appears 50 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought of 488 as 4 hundreds, but actually, it's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 occurs once every 100 pages, so 4 times 10 = 40, plus in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10, making it 50. So, yes, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. So, how many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 99 + 89 is 188? Let me check: 99 + 80 is 179, plus 9 is 188. Yes, that's correct. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 pages, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Plus, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for a block of 10 pages every 100 pages. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: 488 / 100 = 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 pages (480-488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but we only have up to 488, so that's 9 pages. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 occurrences. So, total tens place 8's: 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me double-check: From 1-100, 80-89: 10 times. 101-200: 180-189: 10 times. 201-300: 280-289: 10 times. 301-400: 380-389: 10 times. Then, 401-488: 480-488: 9 times. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the 800s, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, 49 + 49 is 98. So, total 8's: 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in 481-488, 484 is the only one, so +1, total 49.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 pages, so 5*10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in 481-488, 488 is the only one, so +1, total 49.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four contribute 10 each, so 4*10=40. The last one, 480-488, is 9 pages, so +9, total 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. From 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 pages. So, 9 occurrences, correct. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems right.\n\nAnd for 4's, in the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so that's included in the 50 count. So, yes, 50.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 occurrences. That's correct.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I'll consider each position in the page number separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets and then 8 more numbers (481-488). In each full set, the 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for every hundred numbers, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 is the fifth hundred, but it's not a full hundred. Let me think. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 ten times. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for exactly 10 numbers. So, from 1-400, that's four hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 4 x 10 = 40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8. So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but hold on, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, the 4 in the tens place occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, correct. So, that's 10 more, making it 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, in each set of ten, 8 appears once in the units place. From 1-488, there are 48 full sets of ten (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490), but wait, 488 is less than 490, so the last set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in each full set of ten, 8 appears once, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For the tens digit, 8 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers in each hundred. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. From 1-488, how many hundreds? Let's see: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488. So, in each full hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times. So, for 1-400, that's four hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4 x 10 = 40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, 480-488 is the range where the tens digit is 8. That's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in 401-488. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought each hundred contributes 10, but in the last hundred, it's only 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Hmm, but let me check that. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 9. So, total 49.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8 in this book. So, 0 times.\n\nTherefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** In every set of ten numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 full sets (1-480) and one partial set (481-488). Thus, 48 + 1 = 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** In every hundred, 4 appears ten times in the tens place. From 1-400, this is 40 times. From 401-488, it's another 10 times (440-449). Total: 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times.\n   \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every ten numbers, totaling 49.\n2. **Tens place:** In every hundred, 8 appears ten times. From 1-400, this is 40 times. From 401-488, it's 9 times (480-488). Total: 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I'll consider the one-digit page numbers: 1 to 9. The digit 4 appears once here, which is on page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence of 4.\n\nNext, I'll look at the two-digit page numbers: 10 to 99. I can break this down into the tens place and the units place. \n\nFor the tens place, the digit 4 can appear in the tens digit, which would be from 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. \n\nFor the units place, the digit 4 can appear in any two-digit number where the units digit is 4. So, starting from 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, but wait, 44 has a 4 in both the tens and units place, so I need to be careful not to double count. However, since I'm just counting occurrences, each digit is counted separately, so 44 contributes two 4's. So, from 14 to 94, stepping by 10 each time, that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so that's 9 occurrences. \n\nWait, but 44 is included in both the tens and units counts. So, in total, for two-digit numbers, the number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. But wait, 44 is counted twice here, but since each digit is counted separately, that's correct because 44 has two 4's. So, the total is 19.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 40-49, that's 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place. Then, for the units place, from 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, each adding a 4 in the units place. So, 10 + 9 = 19, which is correct because 44 is included in both counts, but each occurrence is counted separately.\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, we have 19 4's. Now, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100 to 488. Here, each page number has three digits: hundreds, tens, and units. \n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since we're going up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\n- For hundreds digit 4: Pages 400 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit can be 0-9, but we need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nLet me break this down by hundreds:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 100-199. The tens digit cycles from 0-9 for each hundred. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149). So, for hundreds 1, 2, 3, each contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. But wait, for hundreds 1, 2, 3, each has 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is a partial hundred. So, let me adjust.\n\nActually, the hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3, and 4. But for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, each has a full set of tens digits from 0-9, so each contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, for hundreds 1, 2, 3: 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 occurrences.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: 400-488. The tens digit here can be 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 occurrences.\n\nSo, total for tens place: 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 40 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nNow, the units place. Again, considering all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488. The units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens and hundreds digit. So, for each hundred, each tens digit, the units digit 4 occurs once every 10 numbers. \n\nLet's break it down by hundreds:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 100-199. For each tens digit (0-9), the units digit 4 occurs once. So, 10 tens digits \u00d7 1 occurrence = 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Similarly, 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3: 300-399. 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Now, here, the tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for each tens digit from 0-8, the units digit 4 occurs once. That's 9 tens digits \u00d7 1 occurrence = 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total for units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 occurrences of 4 in the units place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 40\n- Units place: 39\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. Tens place: 30 from 100-399 and 10 from 400-488, totaling 40. Units place: 10 each for 100-399, so 30, plus 9 from 400-488, totaling 39. So, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. That seems correct.\n\nNow, adding the one-digit and two-digit counts:\n\nOne-digit: 1\nTwo-digit: 19\nThree-digit: 168\nTotal number of 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check. One-digit: 1 (page 4). Two-digit: 10 (40-49) + 9 (14,24,...94) = 19. Three-digit: hundreds place 89, tens place 40, units place 39, total 168. So, 1 + 19 + 168 = 188. Hmm, I think that's correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll follow a similar approach.\n\nStarting with one-digit page numbers: 1-9. The digit 8 appears once, on page 8. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers: 10-99.\n\nTens place: 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the units place. However, 88 has two 8's, but we're counting each occurrence separately. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total for two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 occurrences of 8.\n\nNow, three-digit page numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\n- For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place? Wait, no. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, there are zero occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: Let's consider each hundred:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 100-199. The tens digit 8 occurs in 180-189, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Similarly, 280-289: 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3: 300-399. 380-389: 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: 400-488. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total for tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: For each hundred, each tens digit, the units digit 8 occurs once every 10 numbers.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 100-199. For each tens digit (0-9), the units digit 8 occurs once. So, 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2: 200-299. 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3: 300-399. 10 occurrences.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: 400-488. The tens digits go from 0-8. For each tens digit, the units digit 8 occurs once. So, 9 occurrences (since tens digits go up to 8, not 9). Wait, 400-488: the tens digits are 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), ..., 8 (480-488). So, for each of these 9 tens digits, the units digit 8 occurs once. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total for units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 occurrences.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 39\n- Units place: 39\nTotal: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nAdding the one-digit and two-digit counts:\n\nOne-digit: 1\nTwo-digit: 19\nThree-digit: 78\nTotal number of 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. One-digit: 1. Two-digit: 10 (tens) +9 (units)=19. Three-digit: tens place 39, units place 39, total 78. So, 1+19+78=98. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, number of 4's:\n\n- One-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit:168\nTotal:1+19=20; 20+168=188.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- One-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit:78\nTotal:1+19=20; 20+78=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, but I'm a bit unsure because the difference seems quite large. Let me see if I made a mistake in counting the three-digit numbers.\n\nFor 4's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place:400-488 is 89 pages, each with a 4 in hundreds place. So, 89.\n- Tens place: For hundreds 1,2,3: each has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4 (e.g., 140-149), so 3\u00d710=30. For hundreds 4: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 30+10=40.\n- Units place: For hundreds 1,2,3: each has 10 numbers where units digit is 4 (e.g., 104,114,...,194). So, 3\u00d710=30. For hundreds 4: 404,414,...,484. Since 488 is the last page, the units digit 4 occurs in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers. So, 30+9=39.\n\nTotal 4's in three-digit:89+40+39=168. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place:0, since we don't reach 800.\n- Tens place: For hundreds 1,2,3: each has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8 (e.g., 180-189). So, 3\u00d710=30. For hundreds 4: 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 30+9=39.\n- Units place: For hundreds 1,2,3: each has 10 numbers where units digit is 8 (e.g., 108,118,...,198). So, 3\u00d710=30. For hundreds 4: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers. So, 30+9=39.\n\nTotal 8's in three-digit:0+39+39=78. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. Difference:90.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because I might have miscounted somewhere. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using a formula or a different counting method.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider each digit place separately and calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nFor the units place:\n\n- For 4's: In every block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total units place 4's:48\u00d71 +1=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated 39 for three-digit numbers. Hmm, perhaps I need to reconcile this.\n\nWait, no, because in my earlier method, I broke it down into one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit, but perhaps using this approach would be more accurate.\n\nWait, let's try this method for units place:\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIt's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. So, the number of such numbers is floor((488 -4)/10) +1.\n\nWait, 488 -4 =484, 484/10=48.4, floor is 48, +1=49. So, 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place:8,18,28,...,488. So, 8,18,...,488. The number of such numbers is floor((488 -8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 39 for 4's in units place in three-digit numbers. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier breakdown.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, I had for units place 4's:30 (from 100-399) +9 (from 400-488)=39. But according to this method, units place 4's from 1-488 is 49. So, that suggests that in one-digit and two-digit numbers, units place 4's are 1 (from 4) +9 (from 14,24,...,94) =10. Then, three-digit units place 4's would be 49 -10=39, which matches my earlier count. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: total 49. From one-digit:1 (page 8). Two-digit:9 (18,28,...,98). So, 1+9=10. Three-digit:49-10=39, which matches my earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\nFor 4's in tens place: in every block of 100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, for 4's in tens place, it's 10 per hundred. But let's see:\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nIt's in 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10. So, total 5\u00d710=50. But wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10, but also 450-488 doesn't add any more 4's in the tens place. So, total 50.\n\nWait, but earlier I had for 4's in tens place:10 (from 40-49) +30 (from 100-399) +10 (from 400-488)=50. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place:80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I had for 8's in tens place:10 (from 80-89) +10 (from 180-189) +10 (from 280-289) +9 (from 480-488)=39. Wait, that's inconsistent. Wait, no, in my earlier breakdown, I had for hundreds 1,2,3: each contributes 10, so 30, plus for hundreds 4:9, so total 39. But according to this method, it's 49. Hmm, where's the discrepancy?\n\nWait, no, because in the hundreds 1,2,3, each contributes 10 occurrences in the tens place for 8, so 3\u00d710=30. Then, for hundreds 4, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. So, total 30+9=39. But according to the other method, it's 49. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let's list them:\n\n- 80-89:10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\nTotal:10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nBut in my earlier breakdown, I only considered 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488, which is 5 blocks, but in my earlier counting, I had 3 blocks for hundreds 1,2,3, each contributing 10, and 1 block for hundreds 4 contributing 9, totaling 39. Wait, but that's incorrect because 80-89 is in hundreds 0, which is one-digit and two-digit numbers. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier breakdown by not considering that 80-89 is part of the two-digit numbers, not three-digit.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, the tens digit 8 can be in 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 4 blocks: 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, total 10+10+10+9=39. But in the overall count from 1-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9), totaling 49. So, I think my earlier breakdown for three-digit numbers was incorrect because I didn't include the 80-89 block, which is part of the two-digit numbers.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the three-digit numbers, the tens digit 8 can only appear in 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 4 blocks, totaling 39. But in the entire range from 1-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9), totaling 49. So, in the three-digit numbers, the tens digit 8 appears 39 times, but overall, it's 49 times. Therefore, the two-digit numbers contribute 10 (from 80-89) to the total 49.\n\nWait, but in my earlier breakdown, I had for two-digit numbers: tens place 10 (from 80-89) and units place 9 (from 18,28,...,98), totaling 19 for two-digit 8's. Then, three-digit numbers contributed 39 (tens place) +39 (units place)=78. So, total 8's:1 (one-digit) +19 (two-digit) +78 (three-digit)=98.\n\nBut according to the alternative method, the total number of 8's in the tens place is 49, which includes 10 from two-digit numbers and 39 from three-digit numbers. Similarly, units place is 49, which includes 10 from two-digit and 39 from three-digit. So, total 8's:49 (tens) +49 (units)=98. That matches.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's, tens place is 50, units place is 49, hundreds place is 89. So, total 4's:50+49+89=188.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because earlier I thought the tens place for 8's was 39, but according to the alternative method, it's 49. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier breakdown by not including the 80-89 block in the two-digit numbers when calculating the three-digit numbers. But in reality, the three-digit numbers don't include 80-89; those are two-digit numbers. So, in the three-digit numbers, the tens digit 8 appears in 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488, which is 10+10+10+9=39. So, that's correct. The two-digit numbers include 80-89, which is another 10 occurrences. So, in total, 39 (three-digit) +10 (two-digit) =49 in the tens place for 8's. Similarly, in the units place, it's 39 (three-digit) +10 (two-digit) +1 (one-digit)=49.\n\nSo, the total number of 8's is 49 (tens) +49 (units)=98, which matches the earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's, the hundreds place is 89 (three-digit), tens place is 50 (40-49, 140-149, etc.), and units place is 49. So, total 4's:89+50+49=188.\n\nThus, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nI think this is correct now. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I'll handle the single-digit page numbers. From 1 to 9, the only single-digit number that has a 4 is 4 itself. So that's one 4. Now, moving on to two-digit numbers. Two-digit numbers range from 10 to 99. Here, the digit 4 can appear in the tens place or the units place. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers 40-49 all have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so that's 10 fours. \n\nFor the units place: The numbers 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94 have a 4 in the units place. That's 9 numbers because 44 has already been counted in the tens place, but wait, no, in the units place, each occurrence is separate. Wait, actually, each of these numbers is unique, so from 14, 24, ..., 94, that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 9 fours. \n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 fours. \n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me check that again. From 10 to 99, for the units place, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, from 10-19, 20-29, etc., up to 90-99. That's 9 sets, so 9 fours in the units place. And for the tens place, 40-49 gives 10 fours. So, 10 + 9 = 19 fours in two-digit numbers. That seems correct. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Here, the hundreds place can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let me break this down. \n\nFirst, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, let's consider each case.\n\nWhen the hundreds digit is 1 (100-199): \n\n- The tens and units digits can be anything from 0-9. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers, so in 100-199, the tens digit is 4 in 140-149, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, the units digit is 4 in 104, 114, 124, ..., 194, which is 10 numbers. So, in 100-199, the number of 4's is 10 (tens) + 10 (units) = 20 fours. \n\nWait, but 100-199 is 100 numbers, so each digit place (tens and units) will have each digit 0-9 appearing 10 times. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place and 10 times in the units place, totaling 20 fours. That makes sense.\n\nSimilarly, when the hundreds digit is 2 (200-299):\n\n- The same logic applies. The tens digit is 4 in 240-249 (10 numbers), and the units digit is 4 in 204, 214, ..., 294 (10 numbers). So, another 20 fours.\n\nWhen the hundreds digit is 3 (300-399):\n\n- Tens digit 4: 340-349 (10 numbers)\n- Units digit 4: 304, 314, ..., 394 (10 numbers)\n- So, another 20 fours.\n\nWhen the hundreds digit is 4 (400-488):\n\n- Here, the hundreds digit is 4, so every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, that's 89 fours right there in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's consider the tens and units places in 400-488.\n\nFirst, tens place: The tens digit cycles from 0-9 for each hundred. But since we're only going up to 488, the tens digits go from 0-8 in the hundreds of 400-488. Wait, no, 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last number). Wait, but actually, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the tens digit cycles 0-9 for 400-499, but since we stop at 488, the tens digit goes up to 8. Hmm, maybe it's better to break it down.\n\nWait, 400-488 can be considered as 400-499 minus 489-499. But maybe it's easier to calculate as is.\n\nIn 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see. The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 fours in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? For each set of ten numbers, like 400-409, 410-419, etc., the units digit is 4 once every ten numbers. So, from 400-488, how many such sets are there? Well, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is 8 full decades (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488). Wait, no, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so actually, it's 8 full decades (400-409 up to 470-479) and then 480-488. So, in each full decade, the units digit is 4 once. So, 8 times, plus in 480-488, the units digit 4 appears in 484. So, that's 9 times in total. Wait, let me check:\n\nFrom 400-409: 404\n410-419: 414\n420-429: 424\n430-439: 434\n440-449: 444\n450-459: 454\n460-469: 464\n470-479: 474\n480-488: 484\n\nThat's 9 times. So, 9 fours in the units place.\n\nSo, in 400-488, the number of 4's is:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 fours\n- Tens place: 10 fours (from 440-449)\n- Units place: 9 fours\n\nTotal: 89 + 10 + 9 = 108 fours.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. The hundreds place is straightforward: 89 numbers from 400-488, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours.\n\nIn the tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place, so 10 fours.\n\nIn the units place, as I listed, 404, 414, ..., 484, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 fours.\n\nSo, total 89 + 10 + 9 = 108 fours in the three-digit numbers where the hundreds digit is 4.\n\nNow, adding up all the fours:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit (hundreds 1-3): 20 (for 100-199) + 20 (200-299) + 20 (300-399) = 60\n- Three-digit (hundreds 4): 108\n\nTotal fours: 1 + 19 + 60 + 108 = 188 fours.\n\nWait, let me add that again:\n\n1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) = 20.\n\n20 (100-199) + 20 (200-299) + 20 (300-399) = 60.\n\nSo, 20 + 60 = 80.\n\nThen, adding the hundreds place fours: 108.\n\nSo, 80 + 108 = 188 fours.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the three-digit numbers. Let me recalculate.\n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3:\n\nEach hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributes 20 fours each, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo, 3 hundreds \u00d7 20 fours = 60 fours.\n\nThen, for 400-488, we have 108 fours.\n\nSo, total fours: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 60 (hundreds 1-3) + 108 (hundreds 4) = 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 60 = 80; 80 + 108 = 188. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: 1-9. The only single-digit number with an 8 is 8 itself, so that's one 8.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: 10-99.\n\nIn the tens place: The numbers 80-89 have an 8 in the tens place, which is 10 numbers, so 10 eights.\n\nIn the units place: The numbers 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the units place. So, 9 eights.\n\nWait, but 88 is included in both the tens and units places, but we're counting each occurrence separately, so that's correct.\n\nSo, total eights in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 eights.\n\nNow, three-digit numbers: 100-488.\n\nAgain, hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3:\n\nEach hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributes eights in the tens and units places.\n\nIn each hundred, the tens place: 80-89 in that hundred, so 10 eights.\n\nUnits place: 108, 118, ..., 198 (10 numbers), but wait, 100-199: units digit 8 occurs in 108, 118, ..., 198, which is 10 numbers.\n\nSo, per hundred, 10 (tens) + 10 (units) = 20 eights.\n\nSince there are three such hundreds (1, 2, 3), that's 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 eights.\n\nNow, for the hundreds digit 4: 400-488.\n\nHundreds place: Each number here has a 4, but we're counting 8's, so the hundreds digit is 4, not 8, so no eights here from the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's look at the tens and units places in 400-488.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, but wait, 480-488 is actually 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit is 8 in all these numbers, so that's 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: The units digit is 8 in 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me check:\n\nFrom 400-488, the units digit 8 occurs in:\n\n408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights.\n\nSo, in 400-488, the number of 8's is:\n\n- Tens place: 9 (from 480-488)\n- Units place: 9 (as above)\nTotal: 18 eights.\n\nWait, but let me confirm:\n\nIn the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, 9 eights.\n\nIn the units place, 408, 418, ..., 488: 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the units place. So, 9 eights.\n\nSo, total 18 eights in 400-488.\n\nNow, adding up all the eights:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit (hundreds 1-3): 60\n- Three-digit (hundreds 4): 18\n\nTotal eights: 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 60 = 80; 80 + 18 = 98 eights.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me check again.\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (just 8).\n\nTwo-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nThree-digit (1-3): 3 hundreds \u00d7 20 = 60.\n\nThree-digit (4): 9 (tens) + 9 (units) = 18.\n\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 60 + 18 = 98 eights.\n\nNow, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours or eights.\n\nWait, when I counted the fours in three-digit numbers with hundreds digit 4, I got 108 fours. Let me confirm that:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 fours (400-488)\n- Tens place: 10 fours (440-449)\n- Units place: 9 fours (404, 414, ..., 484)\nTotal: 89 + 10 + 9 = 108 fours. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the eights in 400-488:\n\n- Tens place: 9 eights (480-488)\n- Units place: 9 eights (408, 418, ..., 488)\nTotal: 18 eights.\n\nYes, that adds up.\n\nSo, total fours: 188\n\nTotal eights: 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let's consider single-digit page numbers: 1-9. The digit 4 appears once here, on page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence. Now, moving on to two-digit page numbers: 10-99. In two-digit numbers, the digits can be in the tens place or the units place. Let me separate them.\n\nFor the tens place: The numbers from 40-49 have 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers (40, 41, ..., 49), so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nFor the units place: The 4 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, ..., 94. Wait, but from 10-99, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It should be once every 10 numbers, so 9 times in total (from 14 to 94). But wait, 44 has two 4's, so I need to make sure I'm counting each occurrence. However, in the units place, each occurrence is just one digit, so 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 times, but each has only one 4 in the units place, except 44, which has two 4's, but I'm only counting the units place here. Wait, no, in 44, the tens place is also 4, but I'm considering each digit separately. So, in the units place, 44 contributes one 4, same as the others. So, that's 9 occurrences in the units place.\n\nWait, but from 10 to 99, the units place 4 occurs in 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94, which is 9 numbers, each contributing one 4. So, 9 occurrences in the units place.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 40-49, that's 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place, so 10. Then, in the units place, from 10-99, every 10 numbers, so 9 times (since 40-49 is already counted in the tens place, but the units place 4's in 40-49 are separate). Wait, no, actually, in 40-49, the units digits go from 0-9, so 44 is included in both counts. So, when I count 10 in the tens place and 9 in the units place, I'm correctly counting each occurrence, even if a number has two 4's. So, 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nWait, but 44 has two 4's, so when I count the tens place and the units place separately, I'm including both of them. So, that's correct. So, two-digit numbers contribute 19 4's.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100-488.\n\nThree-digit numbers have hundreds, tens, and units places. I'll need to count the number of 4's in each place.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, since the book goes up to 488. So, numbers from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nIn the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place. In three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 0-9. I need to find how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers up to 488.\n\nLet me break it down by hundreds:\n\n- For 100-199: The tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in 100-199, the tens digit is 4 in 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\n- For 200-299: Similarly, the tens digit is 4 in 240-249, another 10 occurrences.\n\n- For 300-399: Tens digit 4 in 340-349, another 10 occurrences.\n\n- For 400-488: Now, here, the tens digit can go up to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit 4 in 400-488 would be in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, total in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 occurrences.\n\nWait, but let me check: 100-199: 140-149 is 10 numbers.\n\n200-299: 240-249, 10.\n\n300-399: 340-349, 10.\n\n400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers (440-449). So, yes, 10 each, so 40 total.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. The units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, the units digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. Let's calculate for each hundred:\n\n- 100-199: The units digit is 4 in 104, 114, 124, 134, 144, 154, 164, 174, 184, 194. That's 10 occurrences.\n\n- 200-299: Similarly, 204, 214, ..., 294. 10 occurrences.\n\n- 300-399: 304, 314, ..., 394. 10 occurrences.\n\n- 400-488: Now, the units digit 4 appears in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488. So, let's count how many times the units digit is 4 in 400-488.\n\nStarting from 400, the first number with units digit 4 is 404, then 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 404 to 484 is every 10 numbers, but 484 is the last one before 488. Wait, let me count: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 404 to 484 is 9 steps of 10, so 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences in the units place for 400-488.\n\nSo, total units place 4's in three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nWait, but let me check: 100-199: 10\n\n200-299: 10\n\n300-399: 10\n\n400-488: 9\n\nSo, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Because in 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs 9 times, as I listed. So, yes.\n\nSo, total number of 4's in three-digit numbers:\n\nHundreds place: 89\n\nTens place: 40\n\nUnits place: 39\n\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168.\n\nSo, total number of 4's in all page numbers:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 168\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that addition: 1 + 19 is 20, plus 168 is 188. Okay.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in all page numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit: 1-9. The digit 8 appears once, on page 8.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: 10-99.\n\nIn the tens place: The numbers from 80-89 have 8 in the tens place, so that's 10 numbers, contributing 10 occurrences.\n\nIn the units place: The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Wait, but 88 has two 8's, but we're only counting the units place here. So, in the units place, 8 appears 9 times (from 18 to 98, stepping by 10).\n\nSo, two-digit numbers contribute 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 8's.\n\nNow, three-digit numbers: 100-488.\n\nLet's count the number of 8's in each place.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: Let's consider each hundred:\n\n- 100-199: The tens digit is 8 in 180-189, which is 10 numbers, contributing 10 occurrences.\n\n- 200-299: Tens digit 8 in 280-289, another 10 occurrences.\n\n- 300-399: Tens digit 8 in 380-389, another 10 occurrences.\n\n- 400-488: Tens digit 8 in 480-488. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, but 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nUnits place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-199: Units digit 8 appears in 108, 118, 128, 138, 148, 158, 168, 178, 188, 198. That's 10 occurrences.\n\n- 200-299: Similarly, 208, 218, ..., 298. 10 occurrences.\n\n- 300-399: 308, 318, ..., 398. 10 occurrences.\n\n- 400-488: Units digit 8 appears in 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. Let's count: starting from 408, each 10 numbers, so 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total units place 8's in three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nNow, total number of 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\nTens place: 39\n\nUnits place: 39\n\nSo, 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nWait, but let me check: 39 in tens and 39 in units, so 78.\n\nNow, adding up all 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 78\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me add again: 1 + 19 is 20, plus 78 is 98.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188\n\nTotal 8's: 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTens: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-449) = 40? Wait, earlier I thought 400-488's tens place 4's were in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 10. So, 10+10+10+10=40.\n\nUnits: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n\nThree-digit:\n\nTens: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39\n\nUnits: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 39 + 39 = 98.\n\nWait, no, wait: three-digit 8's are tens and units, which are 39 each, so 39 + 39 = 78. Then, single-digit 1, two-digit 19, so 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I'll consider single-digit page numbers. These are from 1 to 9. The digit 4 appears exactly once here, which is on page 4. So, single-digit pages contribute 1 to the count of 4's.\n\nNext, I'll look at the two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each two-digit number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers from 40 to 49 have 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nFor the units place: The digit 4 appears once every ten numbers, starting from 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 times in the units place, right? Wait, but from 10 to 99, that's 9 sets of ten, so 9 times. But wait, 44 has two 4's, but I'm only counting the units place here, so 44 would contribute one 4 in the units place. So, 9 times in the units place.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nWait, no, actually, from 10 to 99, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, from 10 to 99, there are 9 tens (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99). In each of these, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So that's 9 times. But in the 40-49 range, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, that's 10 times. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 + 9 = 19. That seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. These have hundreds, tens, and units places. I need to count the number of 4's in each place.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. Now, for the hundreds place:\n\n- When the hundreds digit is 1: 100-199. There's no 4 in the hundreds place here, so 0 times.\n- When the hundreds digit is 2: 200-299. Similarly, 0 times.\n- When the hundreds digit is 3: 300-399. Again, 0 times.\n- When the hundreds digit is 4: 400-488. Here, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, the tens place for three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9, and the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers up to 488.\n\nLet's break it down by hundreds:\n\n1. Hundreds digit 1: 100-199\n   - Tens digit 4: 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 in the tens place.\n\n2. Hundreds digit 2: 200-299\n   - Tens digit 4: 240-249. Another 10 times.\n\n3. Hundreds digit 3: 300-399\n   - Tens digit 4: 340-349. Another 10 times.\n\n4. Hundreds digit 4: 400-488\n   - Tens digit 4: 440-449. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within range. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, 10 times. So, total 4's in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 10 (100s) + 10 (200s) + 10 (300s) + 10 (400s) = 40 times.\n\nNow, the units place for three-digit numbers. Similarly, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each combination of hundreds and tens digits. So, for each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), I need to count how many times 4 appears in the units place.\n\nLet's go through each hundreds group:\n\n1. Hundreds digit 1: 100-199\n   - For each tens digit (0-9), the units digit 4 appears once. So, 10 times (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194).\n\n2. Hundreds digit 2: 200-299\n   - Similarly, 10 times (204, 214, ..., 294).\n\n3. Hundreds digit 3: 300-399\n   - Again, 10 times (304, 314, ..., 394).\n\n4. Hundreds digit 4: 400-488\n   - Now, here, the units digit 4 appears once for each tens digit from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, let's see: from 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. For each of these, units digit 4 appears once. So, that's 9 times (404, 414, ..., 484). Wait, but 484 is within 488, so yes, 9 times.\n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 400 to 488, so the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, there's a units digit 4. So that's 9 times.\n\nSo, adding up the units place 4's in three-digit numbers:\n\n10 (100s) + 10 (200s) + 10 (300s) + 9 (400s) = 39 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. For hundreds digit 4, 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? For each tens digit from 0 to 8, the units digit 4 appears once. So, 0-8 is 9 tens digits, so 9 times. So, yes, 39.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89 + 40 = 129, plus 39 is 168. Wait, no, that can't be right because 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. But wait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake. The hundreds place for three-digit numbers: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89.\n\nTens place: 40 times, as calculated.\n\nUnits place: 39 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, total 4's in the entire book would be single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1 + 19 = 20 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, no, 1 + 19 is 20, plus 168 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process.\n\nSingle-digit page numbers: 1-9. The digit 8 appears once, on page 8.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers: 10-99.\n\nTens place: Numbers from 80-89 have 8 in the tens place, that's 10 times.\n\nUnits place: The digit 8 appears once every ten numbers, starting from 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 times.\n\nWait, but from 10-99, there are 9 sets of ten, so 9 times in the units place.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nThree-digit page numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place, so 0 times.\n\nTens place: For each hundreds group, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place.\n\n1. Hundreds digit 1: 100-199\n   - Tens digit 8: 180-189. That's 10 times.\n\n2. Hundreds digit 2: 200-299\n   - Tens digit 8: 280-289. 10 times.\n\n3. Hundreds digit 3: 300-399\n   - Tens digit 8: 380-389. 10 times.\n\n4. Hundreds digit 4: 400-488\n   - Tens digit 8: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, so 8 in the tens place appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 10 (100s) + 10 (200s) + 10 (300s) + 9 (400s) = 39 times.\n\nUnits place: For each hundreds group, how many times does 8 appear in the units place.\n\n1. Hundreds digit 1: 100-199\n   - For each tens digit (0-9), units digit 8 appears once. So, 10 times (108, 118, ..., 198).\n\n2. Hundreds digit 2: 200-299\n   - Similarly, 10 times (208, 218, ..., 298).\n\n3. Hundreds digit 3: 300-399\n   - 10 times (308, 318, ..., 398).\n\n4. Hundreds digit 4: 400-488\n   - For each tens digit from 0 to 8, units digit 8 appears once. So, that's 9 times (408, 418, ..., 488).\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, total 8's in the units place for three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nTherefore, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place (39) + units place (39) = 78.\n\nAdding up all the 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 78\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 = 20 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) = 20, plus 78 (three-digit) is 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the three-digit 8's. Tens place: 10+10+10+9=39. Units place: 10+10+10+9=39. So, 39+39=78. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, no, 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) = 20, plus 78 (three-digit) is 98. Correct.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me just go through again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens: 10 (40-49)\n- Units: 9 (14,24,...,94)\nTotal: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds: 89 (400-488)\n- Tens: 40 (10 in each 100s, 200s, 300s, and 10 in 400s)\n- Units: 39 (10 in each 100s, 200s, 300s, and 9 in 400s)\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\nCounting 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens: 10 (80-89)\n- Units: 9 (18,28,...,98)\nTotal: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Tens: 39 (10 in each 100s, 200s, 300s, and 9 in 400s)\n- Units: 39 (10 in each 100s, 200s, 300s, and 9 in 400s)\nTotal: 78\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, seems correct.

    "hit_max_tokens": false,
    "text": " \n\nFirst, let's consider single-digit page numbers: 1 to 9. The digit 4 appears once here, which is on page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence. Now, moving on to two-digit page numbers: 10 to 99. Here, the digits can be in the tens place or the units place. Let me think about the tens place first. The tens digit goes from 1 to 9, so the number of times 4 appears in the tens place is 10 times (from 40 to 49). Similarly, in the units place, 4 can appear once in each set of ten numbers, like 14, 24, 34, ..., 94. That's 9 times. Wait, no, actually, from 10 to 99, each units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so in each ten numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, for two-digit numbers, the number of 4's in the units place is 9 (since we start from 10, so 14, 24, ..., 94). So, in total, two-digit numbers have 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 occurrences of 4.\n\nWait, but hold on, when the tens digit is 4, from 40 to 49, that's 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place, so that's 10. And then in the units place, from 10 to 99, each ten has a 4, so that's 9 times (14,24,...,94). So, 10 + 9 = 19. So, two-digit numbers contribute 19 4's.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100 to 488. Hmm, this is a bit more involved. Let me break it down by hundreds, tens, and units places. \n\nFirst, the hundreds place: For three-digit numbers from 100 to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, when the hundreds digit is 4, the numbers go from 400 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place: For three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 0-9. So, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488. Let me break this down by each hundred group.\n\n- For hundreds digit 1 (100-199): The tens digit cycles from 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 140-149). So, 10 times.\n- Similarly, for hundreds digit 2 (200-299): Tens digit 4 appears 10 times (240-249).\n- For hundreds digit 3 (300-399): Tens digit 4 appears 10 times (340-349).\n- For hundreds digit 4 (400-488): The tens digit can go up to 8, since 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 488 is the last page, so from 400 to 488, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times.\n\nSo, adding these up: 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 10 (hundreds 4) = 40 times. So, 40 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nNow, the units place for three-digit numbers: Similarly, the units digit cycles from 0-9 in each ten numbers. So, for each hundred, the units digit 4 appears 10 times. Let's see:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1 (100-199): Units digit 4 appears 10 times (104,114,...,194).\n- Hundreds digit 2 (200-299): Units digit 4 appears 10 times (204,214,...,294).\n- Hundreds digit 3 (300-399): Units digit 4 appears 10 times (304,314,...,394).\n- Hundreds digit 4 (400-488): Units digit 4 appears how many times? From 400 to 488, the units digit 4 appears in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 times because 484 is the last one before 488. Wait, let's count: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Yes, that's 9 times.\n\nSo, adding these up: 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 9 (hundreds 4) = 39 times. So, 39 occurrences of 4 in the units place.\n\nTherefore, for three-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89 + 40 = 129 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, let me check that addition again. 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. So, 168 4's in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1 + 19 = 20 + 168 = 188. So, total 4's are 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: 1-9. The digit 8 appears once, on page 8. So, that's 1 occurrence.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: 10-99. Let's count the 8's in the tens and units places.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 from 80 to 89, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: In each set of ten numbers, the units digit 8 appears once. So, from 10 to 99, that's 9 times (18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98). Wait, but 88 is counted in both tens and units place, but we're just counting occurrences, so each digit is counted separately. So, 9 times in the units place.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100-488.\n\nAgain, breaking it down by hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens digit across all three-digit numbers up to 488.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1 (100-199): Tens digit 8 appears 10 times (180-189).\n- Hundreds digit 2 (200-299): Tens digit 8 appears 10 times (280-289).\n- Hundreds digit 3 (300-399): Tens digit 8 appears 10 times (380-389).\n- Hundreds digit 4 (400-488): Tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). But wait, the tens digit is 8, so it's 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, adding these up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: Now, counting how many times 8 appears in the units place across all three-digit numbers up to 488.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1 (100-199): Units digit 8 appears 10 times (108,118,...,198).\n- Hundreds digit 2 (200-299): Units digit 8 appears 10 times (208,218,...,298).\n- Hundreds digit 3 (300-399): Units digit 8 appears 10 times (308,318,...,398).\n- Hundreds digit 4 (400-488): Units digit 8 appears from 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 times because 488 is the last page.\n\nSo, adding these up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 occurrences of 8 in the units place.\n\nTherefore, for three-digit numbers, the total number of 8's is tens place (39) + units place (39) = 78.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) = 1 + 19 = 20 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, total 8's are 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1 (page 4)\n- Two-digit: tens place 10 (40-49) + units place 9 (14,24,...,94) = 19\n- Three-digit:\n  - Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89\n  - Tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488, since 440-449 is 10) = 40\n  - Units place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488, since 408,418,...,488 is 9) = 39\n  - Total three-digit 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n- Total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1 (page 8)\n- Two-digit: tens place 10 (80-89) + units place 9 (18,28,...,98) = 19\n- Three-digit:\n  - Tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488, 480-488) = 39\n  - Units place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488, 408,418,...,488) = 39\n  - Total three-digit 8's: 39 + 39 = 78\n- Total 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct.

So, that's 10 occurrences of the digit 4. \n\nFor the units place, the numbers would be 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, so I need to make sure I count each digit. Each of these numbers has one 4 in the units place, except for 44, which has two. But since I'm counting each digit separately, I can say that in the units place, from 10 to 99, every 10 numbers have one 4. There are 9 sets of 10 (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), so that's 9 times one 4, which is 9. But wait, 44 is in the 40-49 range, which I've already counted as 10 in the tens place. So, in the units place, from 10-99, excluding 40-49, how many 4's are there? Let's see: 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But 44 has two 4's, so actually, that's 9 + 1 = 10? Wait, no. Wait, 44 is in the 40-49 range, which I've already counted in the tens place. So, in the units place, from 10-99, excluding 40-49, the 4's in the units place would be 14,24,34,54,64,74,84,94. That's 8 numbers, each contributing one 4. So, 8 occurrences. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers: tens place (10) + units place (8) = 18. \n\nWait, but let me check again. From 10-99, how many 4's in the units place? For each ten (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the units digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each ten, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. There are 9 tens (10-99), so that's 9 occurrences. But 44 is in the 40-49 ten, which we've already counted in the tens place. So, does that mean in the units place, we have 9, but one of them is 44, which we've already counted? So, perhaps we should subtract that one. So, units place 4's: 9 -1 =8. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) +8 (units)=18. \n\nWait, but that seems conflicting. Let me think differently. The total number of 4's in two-digit numbers is the number of times 4 appears in the tens place plus the number of times it appears in the units place. The tens place is 40-49, which is 10 numbers, each contributing one 4, so 10. The units place: for each ten (10-19, 20-29,...,90-99), the units digit is 4 once, so 9 times in total. But 44 is in the 40-49 ten, which we've already counted in the tens place. So, the units place 4's are 9, but one of them is 44, which is already counted in the tens place. So, perhaps the total 4's in two-digit numbers is 10 (tens) +9 (units) =19? But that would double-count 44. Wait, no, because when counting the tens place, we counted all 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place, including 44. Then, when counting the units place, we count all numbers where the units digit is 4, which includes 44, but that's a separate digit. So, perhaps it's correct to count both. So, 44 has two 4's, so in the tens place, 40-49: 10 4's. In the units place, 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94: that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 9 4's in the units place. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 +9=19. But wait, 44 is counted twice, once in the tens and once in the units. So, the total number of 4's in two-digit numbers is 19. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this. Let's list all two-digit numbers and count the 4's:\n\nTens place: 40-49: 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place: 10 4's.\n\nUnits place: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94: 9 numbers, each with a 4 in the units place: 9 4's.\n\nTotal: 10 +9=19 4's in two-digit numbers.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488.\n\nIn three-digit numbers, the digits are hundreds, tens, and units. So, I need to count how many times 4 appears in each place.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nBut wait, 488 is the last page, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's break this down:\n\n- Hundreds digit =1: 100-199: 100 numbers.\n\n- Hundreds digit=2: 200-299: 100 numbers.\n\n- Hundreds digit=3: 300-399: 100 numbers.\n\n- Hundreds digit=4: 400-488: 89 numbers (since 488 is the last).\n\nNow, let's count the number of 4's in each place.\n\nFirst, hundreds place:\n\n- For hundreds digit=4: numbers 400-488. Each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's.\n\nNext, tens place:\n\nIn the tens place, 4 can appear in any of the hundreds groups.\n\nSo, for each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), we can count how many times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nIn each hundreds group, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, for each hundreds group, the number of times 4 appears in the tens place is 10 times (e.g., 140-149 in 100-199, 240-249 in 200-299, etc.), except for the last group, 400-488, where the tens digit can only go up to 8 (since 488 is the last). So, in 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0-8, so 4 appears only once in the tens place (440-449). Wait, no, 440-449 would be 10 numbers, but 488 is the last, so in 400-488, the tens digit can go up to 8, so 440-449 is still within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, actually, in each hundreds group, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times, except perhaps the last group if the tens digit can't reach 4. Wait, no, in 400-488, the tens digit can go up to 8, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, for each hundreds group, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place across all hundreds groups:\n\n- 100-199: 10 (140-149)\n\n- 200-299:10 (240-249)\n\n- 300-399:10 (340-349)\n\n- 400-488:10 (440-449)\n\nSo, that's 4 groups \u00d710=40 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check 400-488. 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, 40 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, units place:\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, 4 can appear in any hundreds group. For each hundreds group, the units digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundreds group, the units digit is 4 exactly once every 10 numbers. So, for each hundreds group, the number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of tens in that group. Wait, no, it's the number of times the units digit is 4, which is once per 10 numbers. So, for each hundreds group, which has 100 numbers, the units digit is 4 ten times (e.g., 104,114,124,...,194 in 100-199). But wait, 100-199 has 100 numbers, so units digit 4 occurs 10 times. Similarly, 200-299: 10 times, 300-399:10 times, and 400-488: let's see, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so how many times does the units digit 4 occur? It's once every 10 numbers, so 89 divided by 10 is 8 full groups (400-409, 410-419,...,480-489), but 488 is the last, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers. So, in 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs 9 times? Wait, no. Let's think: from 400-488, how many numbers have units digit 4? They are 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers. So, in 400-488, units digit 4 occurs 9 times.\n\nSo, total units place 4's:\n\n- 100-199:10\n\n- 200-299:10\n\n- 300-399:10\n\n- 400-488:9\n\nTotal:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers:\n\nHundreds place:89\n\nTens place:40\n\nUnits place:39\n\nTotal:89+40+39=168.\n\nWait, let me add that again:89+40=129, 129+39=168.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers:168.\n\nNow, let's sum up all 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:168\n\nTotal 4's:1+19=20, 20+168=188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, single-digit:1 (page 4)\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:168\n\nTotal:1+19=20, 20+168=188.\n\nHmm, 188 4's.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers:1-9. The single-digit 8 is page 8. So, that's one 8.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers:10-99.\n\nAgain, let's count 8's in tens and units places.\n\nTens place:80-89. That's 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, 10 8's.\n\nUnits place: For each ten (10-19, 20-29,...,90-99), the units digit is 8 once. So, 9 tens, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 9 8's.\n\nBut wait, 88 is in the 80-89 range, so when counting units place, 88 is included. So, in the units place, from 10-99, the numbers are 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 9 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19.\n\nNow, three-digit page numbers:100-488.\n\nAgain, hundreds, tens, units.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4.\n\nBut 8 in the hundreds place would be 800-899, which is beyond 488, so no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, hundreds place:0 8's.\n\nTens place:\n\nIn each hundreds group (100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488), the tens digit can be 8.\n\nSo, for each hundreds group, the tens digit 8 occurs in 10 numbers (e.g., 180-189 in 100-199, etc.), except for the last group, 400-488, where the tens digit can go up to 8, so 480-488 is 9 numbers.\n\nWait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, in each hundreds group:\n\n- 100-199:10 (180-189)\n\n- 200-299:10 (280-289)\n\n- 300-399:10 (380-389)\n\n- 400-488:9 (480-488)\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nUnits place:\n\nIn each hundreds group, the units digit 8 occurs once every 10 numbers. So, for each hundreds group, the number of 8's in the units place is equal to the number of tens in that group. Wait, no, it's once per 10 numbers. So, for each hundreds group:\n\n- 100-199:10 numbers where units digit is 8 (108,118,...,198)\n\n- 200-299:10 numbers (208,218,...,298)\n\n- 300-399:10 numbers (308,318,...,398)\n\n- 400-488: let's see, from 400-488, the units digit 8 occurs in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers.\n\nSo, units place 8's:\n\n10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\nTens place:39\n\nUnits place:39\n\nTotal:39+39=78.\n\nNow, total 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:78\n\nTotal:1+19=20, 20+78=98.\n\nSo, total 8's:98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:168\n\nTotal:1+19=20+168=188.\n\n8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:78\n\nTotal:1+19=20+78=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the three-digit counts again because that's where most of the digits are.\n\nFor 4's in three-digit numbers:\n\nHundreds place:400-488:89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place:89.\n\nTens place:In each hundreds group, 10 times 4 in tens place:4 groups \u00d710=40.\n\nUnits place:In each hundreds group, 10 times except the last group where it's 9:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nTotal:89+40+39=168.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nFor 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\nTens place:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nUnits place:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nTotal:78.\n\nYes, that adds up.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, 8's:98.\n\nDifference:90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let's consider single-digit page numbers: 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears once, which is on page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence. \n\nNext, let's look at two-digit page numbers: 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers from 40 to 49 have 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4. \n\nFor the units place: The numbers ending with 4 in the units place occur every 10 numbers. So, starting from 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, but wait, 44 has 4 in both tens and units place, but I'm only counting the units place here, so it's still 9 occurrences. \n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because each number has hundreds, tens, and units places. I'll need to consider each place separately. \n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since we're going up to 488, the hundreds digit 4 only goes up to 488, not 499. But for the hundreds place, how many times does 4 appear? From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. \n\nNext, the tens place: I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488. \n\nLet's break it down by hundreds:\n- For hundreds digit 1: The tens place can be 0-9, so numbers from 100 to 109, 110-119, etc. The tens digit 4 occurs in 140-149. That's 10 numbers.\n- Similarly, for hundreds digit 2: The tens digit 4 occurs in 240-249. Another 10 numbers.\n- For hundreds digit 3: The tens digit 4 occurs in 340-349. Another 10 numbers.\n- For hundreds digit 4: The tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 400-488. That's 10 numbers.\n\nSo, in total, the tens place has 10 (hundreds=1) + 10 (hundreds=2) + 10 (hundreds=3) + 10 (hundreds=4) = 40 occurrences of 4. \n\nWait, but hold on, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, yes, 40 times in the tens place. \n\nNow, the units place: How many times does 4 appear in the units place from 100 to 488? \n\nAgain, breaking it down by hundreds:\n- For hundreds digit 1: The units digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears once in the units place every 10 numbers. From 100-199, that's 10 occurrences (104, 114, ..., 194).\n- Similarly, for hundreds digit 2: 204, 214, ..., 294. That's another 10.\n- For hundreds digit 3: 304, 314, ..., 394. Another 10.\n- For hundreds digit 4: From 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, let me count these. Starting from 404, each 10 numbers. So, 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, adding them up: 10 (hundreds=1) + 10 (hundreds=2) + 10 (hundreds=3) + 9 (hundreds=4) = 39 occurrences in the units place.\n\nTherefore, in the three-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168 times.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's:\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal 4's = 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check the three-digit counts. \n\nWait, 89 in the hundreds place, 40 in the tens, and 39 in the units. 89+40=129, 129+39=168. Then adding single and two-digit: 1+19=20, 20+168=188. Hmm, maybe that's correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process.\n\nSingle-digit page numbers: 1-9. The digit 8 appears once, on page 8. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers: 10-99. \n\nTens place: The numbers from 80-89 have 8 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: Numbers ending with 8: 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 numbers. But wait, 88 has 8 in both tens and units, but we're only counting units here, so it's still 9.\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, 8 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times.\n\nThree-digit page numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since 8 is not in the hundreds place for any three-digit number here (as hundreds digits go up to 4), the hundreds place contributes 0 occurrences.\n\nTens place: Count how many times 8 appears in the tens place from 100-488.\n\nBreakdown by hundreds:\n- Hundreds digit 1: 180-189. That's 10 numbers.\n- Hundreds digit 2: 280-289. 10 numbers.\n- Hundreds digit 3: 380-389. 10 numbers.\n- Hundreds digit 4: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nUnits place: How many times does 8 appear in the units place from 100-488?\n\nAgain, by hundreds:\n- Hundreds digit 1: 108, 118, 128, 138, 148, 158, 168, 178, 188, 198. That's 10.\n- Hundreds digit 2: 208, 218, ..., 298. 10.\n- Hundreds digit 3: 308, 318, ..., 398. 10.\n- Hundreds digit 4: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. Let's count: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total in units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nTherefore, in three-digit numbers, the digit 8 appears 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78 times.\n\nAdding up all the 8's:\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal 8's = 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Single: 1\n- Two-digit: tens 10, units 9 \u2192 19\n- Three-digit: hundreds 89, tens 40, units 39 \u2192 168\nTotal: 1+19+168=188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Single: 1\n- Two-digit: tens 10, units 9 \u2192 19\n- Three-digit: tens 39, units 39 \u2192 78\nTotal: 1+19+78=98\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nHmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I overcounted somewhere. Let me check the three-digit counts again.\n\nIn three-digit numbers for 4's:\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. Correct.\n- Tens place: For each hundred (1,2,3,4), 10 each, so 40. Correct.\n- Units place: For hundreds 1,2,3, each have 10, but for 4, only 9 because 488 is the limit. So, 10+10+10+9=39.

    "text": " \n\nFirst, for the single-digit page numbers, from 1 to 9. The only single-digit number that has a 4 is 4 itself. So, that's one 4. Now, moving on to two-digit numbers, from 10 to 99. Here, the digit 4 can appear in the tens place or the units place. Let me think about the tens place first. If the tens digit is 4, the numbers would be from 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Then, for the units place, the 4 can appear in numbers like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, but wait, 44 has two 4's, so does that mean I should count each digit separately? Yes, because each occurrence counts. So, from 14, 24, ..., 94, that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place, except for 44, which has two 4's. Wait, no, I think I'm overcomplicating. Actually, for each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each ten's group, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 ten's groups (10-99), so that's 9 occurrences of 4 in the units place. But wait, from 10-99, that's 9 ten's groups (10-19 up to 90-99), so 9 times 1, which is 9. But wait, 40-49 is a ten's group where the tens digit is 4, which we've already counted as 10. So, the total number of 4's in two-digit numbers would be 10 (from 40-49) plus 9 (from units place in other ten's groups), totaling 19. But wait, 44 has two 4's, so does that mean I'm missing one? No, because when I count 40-49, I'm counting each digit, so 44 is included in both the tens and units counts. So, in 40-49, each number has a 4 in the tens place, which is 10 digits, and in the units place, 44 is one of them, so that's an extra 4. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers would be 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. But wait, 44 is counted twice, once in the tens and once in the units. So, that's correct because it has two 4's. So, 19 4's in two-digit numbers. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers, from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because there are three places: hundreds, tens, and units. Let's break it down. First, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book ends at 488. So, let's consider each hundreds group: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. \n\nStarting with 100-199: The hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's here. So, no 4's in the hundreds place for this group. \n\nNext, 200-299: Similarly, hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's here either. \n\nThen, 300-399: Hundreds digit is 3, so again, no 4's in the hundreds place. \n\nFinally, 400-488: Hundreds digit is 4. Now, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? Let's see, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, each of these 89 numbers has a 4. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. \n\nNow, let's consider the tens place in three-digit numbers. For each hundreds group, we can look at the tens digit. The digit 4 can appear in the tens place in each hundreds group. Let's go through each hundreds group:\n\n1. 100-199: The tens digit can be 0-9. So, the numbers where the tens digit is 4 are 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. \n\n2. 200-299: Similarly, the tens digit 4 appears in 240-249, another 10 numbers, so 10 4's. \n\n3. 300-399: The tens digit 4 appears in 340-349, another 10 numbers, so 10 4's. \n\n4. 400-488: The tens digit 4 appears in 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers, so 10 4's. \n\nSo, in total, for the tens place in three-digit numbers, we have 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 4's. \n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, considering each hundreds group:\n\n1. 100-199: The units digit can be 0-9. So, for each ten's group, the units digit 4 appears once. There are 10 ten's groups (0-9), so 10 numbers where the units digit is 4, contributing 10 4's. \n\n2. 200-299: Similarly, 10 numbers where the units digit is 4, so another 10 4's. \n\n3. 300-399: Another 10 numbers with units digit 4, so 10 4's. \n\n4. 400-488: Now, here, the units digit 4 appears in numbers like 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, but let me check: from 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten's group. So, for each ten's group (400-409, 410-419, etc.), the units digit 4 appears once. How many ten's groups are there in 400-488? Let's see, 400-409 is one, 410-419, ..., up to 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so the units digit 4 would appear in 484. So, how many ten's groups are there? From 400-488, that's 9 ten's groups (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488). Wait, no, actually, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is 9 ten's groups (each ten's group is 10 numbers, except the last one which is 9 numbers). So, in each ten's group, the units digit 4 appears once, except possibly the last one. Wait, 480-488: the units digits go from 0 to 8, so 484 is included, so that's one occurrence. So, in 400-488, the units digit 4 appears 9 times (once in each ten's group, including the last partial one). Wait, no, let me think again. From 400-488, the ten's digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last). So, each ten's group (0-9, 10-19, etc.) up to 80-89. So, that's 9 ten's groups. In each, the units digit 4 appears once, so 9 times. So, total 9 4's in the units place for 400-488. \n\nWait, but earlier, for 100-199, 200-299, and 300-399, each had 10 4's in the units place, right? So, for 100-199: 10 4's, 200-299: 10, 300-399:10, and 400-488:9. So, total units place 4's in three-digit numbers would be 10 + 10 + 10 +9 = 39. \n\nWait, but let me confirm. For 100-199, the units digit 4 appears in 104,114,124,...,194. That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's. Similarly for 200-299, 204,214,...,294: 10 4's. Same for 300-399: 304,314,...,394:10 4's. Now, for 400-488, the units digit 4 appears in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488. So, yes, 9 4's in the units place for 400-488. So, total units place 4's in three-digit numbers: 10+10+10+9=39. \n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit: hundreds place 89, tens place 40, units place 39. So, 89+40+39=168.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 89+40=129, plus 39 is 168. So total 4's:1+19+168=188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, the hundreds place contributes 89 4's (from 400-488), which is correct because each of those 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nThen, in the tens place, across all hundreds groups, we have 10 (100-199) +10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+10 (400-488)=40. That's correct.\n\nIn the units place, 10+10+10+9=39. So, 89+40+39=168.\n\nThen, adding single-digit and two-digit:1+19=20. So, total 4's:20+168=188.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with single-digit: from 1-9, the only 8 is page 8, so that's one 8.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: from 10-99. Let's count the 8's.\n\nFirst, in the tens place: numbers from 80-89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nThen, in the units place: for each ten's group (10-19,20-29,...,90-99), the units digit 8 appears once. So, that's 9 ten's groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 9 8's.\n\nBut wait, 88 is included in both counts: it's in 80-89 (tens place) and has an 8 in the units place. So, total 8's in two-digit numbers:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19.\n\nNow, three-digit numbers: from 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, when does the hundreds digit equal 8? Never, because the book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit only goes up to 4. So, hundreds place contributes 0 8's.\n\nTens place: in each hundreds group, the tens digit can be 0-9. So, let's go through each hundreds group:\n\n1. 100-199: tens digit 8 appears in 180-189. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\n2. 200-299: tens digit 8 appears in 280-289, another 10 8's.\n\n3. 300-399: tens digit 8 appears in 380-389, another 10 8's.\n\n4. 400-488: tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), so that's 9 8's in the tens place for this group.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's in three-digit numbers:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nUnits place in three-digit numbers: for each hundreds group, the units digit 8 appears once per ten's group. Let's go through each hundreds group:\n\n1. 100-199: units digit 8 appears in 108,118,128,...,198. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\n2. 200-299: units digit 8 appears in 208,218,...,298. 10 8's.\n\n3. 300-399: units digit 8 appears in 308,318,...,398. 10 8's.\n\n4. 400-488: units digit 8 appears in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Wait, 488 is included, so that's 9 numbers because from 400-488, the units digit 8 appears in 408,418,...,488. Let's count: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 8's.\n\nSo, total units place 8's in three-digit numbers:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nWait, but let me check: in 400-488, how many times does the units digit 8 appear? From 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten's group. So, for each ten's group (400-409,410-419,...,480-488), the units digit 8 appears once. The last ten's group is 480-488, which includes 488, so that's one occurrence. So, total ten's groups: from 400-488, that's 9 ten's groups (400-409,410-419,...,480-488). So, 9 occurrences of 8 in the units place. So, yes, 9.\n\nSo, total units place 8's in three-digit numbers:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit: tens place 39, units place 39. So, 39+39=78.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Wait, in three-digit numbers, the 8's in the tens place are 39, and the 8's in the units place are 39. So, total 39+39=78 8's in three-digit numbers.\n\nSo, total 8's overall: single-digit 1 + two-digit 19 + three-digit 78=1+19=20+78=98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, total 4's:188, total 8's:98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because 90 seems like a big difference, and I might have made a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me go back and verify.\n\nFirst, counting 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1 (page 4)\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place:40-49:10 4's\n\n- Units place:14,24,...,94:9 numbers, each contributing one 4, so 9 4's\n\nTotal two-digit 4's:10+9=19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds place:400-488:89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place:89\n\n- Tens place:100-199:140-149:10\n\n200-299:240-249:10\n\n300-399:340-349:10\n\n400-488:440-449:10\n\nTotal tens place 4's:10+10+10+10=40\n\nUnits place:\n\n100-199:104,114,...,194:10\n\n200-299:204,214,...,294:10\n\n300-399:304,314,...,394:10\n\n400-488:404,414,...,484:9\n\nTotal units place 4's:10+10+10+9=39\n\nSo, three-digit 4's:89+40+39=168\n\nTotal 4's:1+19+168=188\n\nNow, counting 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1 (page 8)\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place:80-89:10\n\n- Units place:18,28,...,98:9\n\nTotal two-digit 8's:10+9=19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Tens place:\n\n100-199:180-189:10\n\n200-299:280-289:10\n\n300-399:380-389:10\n\n400-488:480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page)\n\nTotal tens place 8's:10+10+10+9=39\n\nUnits place:\n\n100-199:108,118,...,198:10\n\n200-299:208,218,...,298:10\n\n300-399:308,318,...,398:10\n\n400-488:408,418,...,488:9\n\nTotal units place 8's:10+10+10+9=39\n\nSo, three-digit 8's:39+39=78\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nWait, so the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, that seems correct based on the counts. I think I did it right.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let's consider the single-digit page numbers: 1-9. Here, the only page number that has a 4 is page 4. So, that's one 4. Now, moving on to two-digit numbers: 10-99. I think I can break this down into the tens place and the units place. \n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers, the 4 can appear in the tens digit, which would be from 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so that's 10 4's in the tens place. \n\nFor the units place, the 4 can appear in numbers like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but from 10-99, so that's 9 numbers: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. Each of these contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 9 more 4's. \n\nWait, but hold on, 44 has two 4's, right? So, when I count the units place, I should include that. So, in the units place, how many 4's are there? From 10-99, every ten numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 10-19: 14, 20-29:24, and so on up to 90-99:94. That's 9 times, each contributing one 4, so 9 4's. But 44 has two 4's, so does that mean I should count it as two? Wait, no, because when I'm counting the units place, I'm only considering the units digit, so 44 would contribute one 4 in the units place, and one in the tens place. So, in the tens place, 40-49 has 10 4's, and in the units place, 14,24,...,94 gives 9 4's. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 4's. \n\nWait, but 44 is counted twice here, once in the tens and once in the units. But that's correct because it has two 4's. So, that's okay. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers: 19. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers: 100-488. Hmm, this is a bit more complex because there are more digits to consider. Let's break it down into hundreds, tens, and units places. \n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, but when it's 4, the tens and units digits are limited. \n\nLet's handle the hundreds place first. For hundreds digit 1, 2, 3, the hundreds place is 1, 2, or 3, respectively, and the tens and units digits can be anything from 0-9, except when the hundreds digit is 4, which goes up to 488. \n\nSo, for hundreds digit 1: 100-199. How many 4's are there in this range? Let's consider each digit place.\n\nHundreds place: 1, so no 4's here.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9, so in 100-199, the tens digit is 4 in 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: Similarly, for each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9, so 4 appears once every ten numbers. So, from 100-199, the units digit is 4 in 104,114,124,134,144,154,164,174,184,194. That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the units place.\n\nSo, total 4's in 100-199: 10 (tens) + 10 (units) = 20 4's.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digit 2: 200-299.\n\nHundreds place: 2, so no 4's.\n\nTens place: 240-249: 10 numbers, 10 4's.\n\nUnits place: 204,214,224,234,244,254,264,274,284,294: 10 numbers, 10 4's.\n\nTotal 4's in 200-299: 10 + 10 = 20.\n\nSame for hundreds digit 3: 300-399.\n\nTens place: 340-349: 10 4's.\n\nUnits place: 304,314,324,334,344,354,364,374,384,394: 10 4's.\n\nTotal: 20 4's.\n\nNow, hundreds digit 4: 400-488.\n\nHere, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 1 4 per number. From 400-488, how many numbers? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, the tens place in 400-488: The tens digit can be from 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, when does the tens digit equal 4? That's 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, right? So, that's 10 numbers: 440,441,...,449. So, 10 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 488 is the last page, so 449 is okay. So, 10 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the units place: For each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9, but since we're only going up to 488, we have to check if 488 affects the units place. Wait, no, because the units digit is independent. So, in 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nWell, for each tens group, like 400-409, 410-419, etc., up to 480-488. So, in each of these tens groups, the units digit cycles 0-9, except the last group, 480-488, which only goes up to 8 in the units place.\n\nSo, let's see. From 400-479: Each ten has a units digit of 4, so 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474. That's 8 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the units place.\n\nWait, but from 400-479, that's 80 numbers (since 479 - 400 + 1 = 80), which is 8 sets of ten. So, each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so 8 4's.\n\nThen, from 480-488: The units digits go from 0-8, so 484 is the only number with a 4 in the units place. So, that's one more 4.\n\nSo, total units place 4's in 400-488: 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 400-479, that's 80 numbers, which is 8 tens. So, in each ten, the units digit 4 appears once, so 8 times. Then, from 480-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, that's 9 in total.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me list them out:\n\n404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 4's in the units place.\n\nWait, so that's correct. So, 9 4's in the units place.\n\nSo, total 4's in 400-488:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 (from 400-488)\n- Tens place: 10 (from 440-449)\n- Units place: 9 (as above)\nTotal 4's in 400-488: 89 + 10 + 9 = 108 4's.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. The hundreds place is 4 in every number from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTens place: 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\nUnits place: 404,414,...,484: that's 9 numbers, so 9 4's.\n\nSo, 89 + 10 + 9 = 108 4's in 400-488.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 20 (100-199) + 20 (200-299) + 20 (300-399) + 108 (400-488) = 20 + 20 + 20 + 108 = 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in three-digit numbers:\n\n100-199: 20 4's\n\n200-299: 20 4's\n\n300-399: 20 4's\n\n400-488: 108 4's\n\nSo, 20 + 20 + 20 = 60, plus 108 is 168. Then, single-digit:1, two-digit:19, so total 1 + 19 + 168 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with single-digit: 8. So, one 8.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: 10-99.\n\nTens place: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\nUnits place: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the units place.\n\nWait, but 88 has two 8's, so in the units place, we count each occurrence. So, from 10-99, the units digit is 8 in 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98: that's 9 times, so 9 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 8's.\n\nNow, three-digit numbers: 100-488.\n\nAgain, breaking it down into hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nHundreds digit 1: 100-199.\n\nHundreds place: 1, so no 8's.\n\nTens place: 180-189: 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\nUnits place: 108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\nTotal 8's in 100-199: 10 + 10 = 20.\n\nSimilarly, hundreds digit 2: 200-299.\n\nTens place: 280-289: 10 8's.\n\nUnits place: 208,218,228,238,248,258,268,278,288,298: 10 8's.\n\nTotal: 20 8's.\n\nHundreds digit 3: 300-399.\n\nTens place: 380-389: 10 8's.\n\nUnits place: 308,318,328,338,348,358,368,378,388,398: 10 8's.\n\nTotal: 20 8's.\n\nHundreds digit 4: 400-488.\n\nHundreds place: 4, so no 8's here.\n\nTens place: 480-488: Wait, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. But 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 in all these, so that's 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but in 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: Now, in 400-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nWell, for each tens group, like 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. In each of these, the units digit cycles through 0-9, except the last group which goes up to 8.\n\nSo, in 400-479, each ten has a units digit of 8 once, so 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478. That's 8 numbers, so 8 8's.\n\nIn 480-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. So, 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more 8.\n\nSo, total units place 8's: 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nWait, let me list them:\n\n408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's in 400-488:\n\n- Tens place: 9\n- Units place: 9\nTotal: 18 8's.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit:20 (100-199) + 20 (200-299) + 20 (300-399) + 18 (400-488) = 20 + 20 + 20 + 18 = 78\nTotal 8's:1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n100-199:20\n\n200-299:20\n\n300-399:20\n\n400-488:18\n\nSo, 20+20+20+18=78\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my counts again because 90 seems high, but maybe it's correct.\n\nWait, let me go through the 4's count again to make sure.\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n100-199:20\n\n200-299:20\n\n300-399:20\n\n400-488:108\n\nTotal 4's:1+19+20+20+20+108=188\n\n8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n100-199:20\n\n200-299:20\n\n300-399:20\n\n400-488:18\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+20+20+20+18=98\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the count in 400-488 correct? Because 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's. Then, in the tens place, 440-449 is 10 4's, and in the units place, 404,414,...,484: 9 4's. So, 89+10+9=108. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's in 400-488: Tens place is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. Units place: 408,418,...,488: 9 8's. So, 9+9=18. That seems correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a big difference, but maybe that's correct. Let me think of another way to calculate this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's digit by digit, place by place.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, from 1-480, there are 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of 10. So, 48 times. But wait, 480 is a multiple of 10, so 480/10=48. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is beyond 480, so in 481-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 484 is another 4. So, total 48 +1=49 4's in the units place.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 188 4's, which includes units, tens, and hundreds. So, perhaps this method is different.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it digit by digit, place by place, considering each position separately.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFor each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), count how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, the number of complete decades is 48 (since 480 is the last multiple of 10 before 488). So, 48 times. Plus, in 481-488, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484). So, total 48 +1=49 4's in units place.\n\nSimilarly, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nFrom 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, 48 times (from 1-480). Then, in 481-488, 8 appears once at 488. So, total 48 +1=49 8's in units place.\n\nWait, so units place: 49 4's and 49 8's. So, no difference here.\n\nNow, tens place:\n\nHow many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nEach hundred has a block where the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n\nFrom 1-488, how many such blocks are there?\n\nIn each hundred, there's one block of 10 where the tens digit is 4. So, in 1-99: 40-49:10 numbers.\n\nIn 100-199:140-149:10\n\nIn 200-299:240-249:10\n\nIn 300-399:340-349:10\n\nIn 400-488:440-449:10 (since 449 is within 488)\n\nSo, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5*10=50 4's.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's fine.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place:50.\n\nSimilarly, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nEach hundred has a block where the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n\nFrom 1-488:\n\n1-99:80-89:10\n\n100-199:180-189:10\n\n200-299:280-289:10\n\n300-399:380-389:10\n\n400-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place:10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nSo, 4's in tens place:50, 8's:49. So, 50-49=1 more 4 in the tens place.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nHow many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place?\n\nFrom 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers (400-488 inclusive). So, 89 4's.\n\nHow many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place?\n\nIn a 488-page book, the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. 8 is higher than 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nNow, let's add up:\n\n4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\n\n8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that's consistent with my earlier count. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think this makes sense now. So, the final answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. From 1 to 480, there are 480/10 = 48 occurrences.\n   - In 481-488, 484 adds one more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred has a block (e.g., 40-49) where 4 appears 10 times.\n   - There are 5 such blocks (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400-488, 4 appears in the hundreds place for 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. From 1 to 480, 48 occurrences.\n   - In 481-488, 488 adds one more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred has a block (e.g., 80-89) where 8 appears 10 times.\n   - There are 4 full blocks (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and a partial block (400-488) with 9 occurrences (480-488).\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I'll go through each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. \n\nStarting with the units place for 4's: In every block of 10 numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many such blocks are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). In each complete block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. In the partial block, 481-488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once in 484. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place for 4's: Here, the digit 4 appears in a block of 10 numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see. The first block is 40-49, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's five blocks, each contributing 10 4's. So that's 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is another block, so that's actually five blocks. Wait, let me count again: 40-49 (1), 140-149 (2), 240-249 (3), 340-349 (4), 440-449 (5). Yes, five blocks, so 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place for 4's: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 89 numbers. So, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place for 8's: Similar to 4's, in every block of 10, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks? 48 complete blocks (as before), each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the partial block 481-488: units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, tens place for 8's: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Each complete block (like 80-89) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, let's count the blocks: 80-89 (1), 180-189 (2), 280-289 (3), 380-389 (4), and 480-488. Now, 480-488 is not a full block; it's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, in the tens place, how many 8's are there? In 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all numbers from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, each of these contributes one 8 in the tens place. So, for the tens place: 4 complete blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 4 * 10 = 40, plus the partial block 480-488 contributing 9. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place for 8's: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds: 0. So total 8's: 98.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4's, I had 188. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But wait, did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me check again.\n\nWait, when counting the tens place for 8's, I said 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So that's 9 8's, correct. And the other blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contribute 10 8's, so 4 blocks *10 = 40. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place for 8's. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 48 times, plus the last partial block. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8 in units place, so 48. Then, in 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, 48 +1=49. That seems correct.\n\nNow, for the 4's, I had 188. Let me check again:\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48 full blocks (1-480), each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in 481-488, units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once in 484. So, 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place for 4's: Blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10 4's, so 5 blocks *10=50.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89= 188. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about the tens place for 8's, I thought maybe 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's 9 8's in the tens place. But wait, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so each of those 9 numbers contributes an 8 in the tens place. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. The hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, which is beyond our book's 488 pages, so no 8's in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the 4's in the hundreds place: from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I just thought, in the tens place for 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. But in the 4's tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers, contributing 10 4's. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but wait a second. When I count the 4's in the tens place, the last block is 440-449, which is entirely within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, correct.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, 188 -98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just check once more to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 full decades (1-480) +1 in 484: total 49\n- Tens: 5 decades (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449) *10: 50\n- Hundreds: 400-488:89\nTotal:49+50+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:48 full decades +1 in 488:49\n- Tens:4 full decades (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389)*10=40 +9 in 480-488=49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I'll look at single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. The only single-digit number with a 4 is 4 itself. So, there's one 4 in the single-digit pages. \n\nNext, I'll consider two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. In two-digit numbers, the digits can be in the tens place or the units place. I'll need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers from 40 to 49 have 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so that's 10 occurrences of 4. \n\nFor the units place: The numbers ending with 4 in the two-digit range are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, and 94. Let me count them: 14 is one, 24 is two, 34 is three, 44 is four, 54 is five, 64 is six, 74 is seven, 84 is eight, 94 is nine. So, that's 9 occurrences of 4 in the units place. \n\nWait, but I just realized that 44 has two 4's, one in the tens and one in the units place. So, when I count the tens place, I included the 4 in 44, and when I count the units place, I included it again. So, in total, for two-digit numbers, I have 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 occurrences of 4. But wait, 44 is counted twice here, once in each place. So, is that correct? Yes, because each digit is considered separately. So, 10 in the tens and 9 in the units, totaling 19. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because now we have hundreds, tens, and units places. I'll need to count the occurrences of 4 in each of these places. \n\nFirst, let's break down the range. The three-digit numbers go from 100 to 488. So, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're only going up to 488, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens and units digits are limited. \n\nLet me handle each digit place separately.\n\n1. **Hundreds place:** \n   - For hundreds digit 1: The hundreds place is 1, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, 0 occurrences.\n   - For hundreds digit 2: Similarly, 0 occurrences.\n   - For hundreds digit 3: 0 occurrences.\n   - For hundreds digit 4: The numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. But wait, let me check: 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:** \n   - I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488.\n   - The tens digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9. When the tens digit is 4, that's 10 numbers per hundred. But since we're going up to 488, I need to check if the hundreds digit is 4 and the tens digit is 4, how many numbers are there.\n   - Let's break it down by hundreds:\n     - Hundreds digit 1: Tens digit 4 occurs from 140 to 149. That's 10 numbers.\n     - Hundreds digit 2: Tens digit 4 occurs from 240 to 249. Another 10 numbers.\n     - Hundreds digit 3: Tens digit 4 occurs from 340 to 349. Another 10 numbers.\n     - Hundreds digit 4: Tens digit 4 occurs from 440 to 449. That's 10 numbers. However, since we're only going up to 488, 440 to 449 is within range, so that's 10 numbers.\n   - So, total tens place 4's: 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 10 (hundreds 4) = 40 occurrences.\n\n3. **Units place:** \n   - Similarly, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, the units digit goes from 0 to 9. When the units digit is 4, that's once every 10 numbers.\n   - Let's calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place from 100 to 488.\n   - For each hundred:\n     - Hundreds digit 1: Units digit 4 occurs at 104, 114, 124, 134, 144, 154, 164, 174, 184, 194. That's 10 occurrences.\n     - Hundreds digit 2: Similarly, 204, 214, ..., 294. 10 occurrences.\n     - Hundreds digit 3: 304, 314, ..., 394. 10 occurrences.\n     - Hundreds digit 4: Now, from 400 to 488, the units digit 4 occurs at 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, how many is that? Let's count: 404 is one, 414 is two, 424 is three, 434 is four, 444 is five, 454 is six, 464 is seven, 474 is eight, 484 is nine. So, that's 9 occurrences because 484 is the last one before 488, and the next would be 494, which is beyond 488. So, 9 occurrences in the hundreds digit 4.\n   - So, total units place 4's: 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 9 (hundreds 4) = 39 occurrences.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\nTotal 4's = 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Single-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:89+40+39=168. So 1+19=20, 20+168=188. Yes, that seems right.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: 1-9. The only single-digit number with an 8 is 8 itself. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers: 10-99. Again, counting 8's in tens and units places.\n\n- Tens place: Numbers from 80 to 89 have 8 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n- Units place: Numbers ending with 8 are 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. Let's count: 18 is one, 28 is two, 38 is three, 48 is four, 58 is five, 68 is six, 78 is seven, 88 is eight, 98 is nine. So, 9 occurrences.\nBut wait, 88 has two 8's, so when counting tens and units, we've included both. So, total two-digit 8's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nNow, three-digit page numbers: 100-488. Again, hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\n1. **Hundreds place:** \n   - Hundreds digit is 1,2,3,4. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because we're only going up to 488, and the hundreds digit is 1,2,3,4. So, 0 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:** \n   - For each hundred, the tens digit cycles. So, for hundreds digits 1,2,3,4, we need to find how many times 8 appears in the tens place.\n   - Hundreds digit 1: Tens digit 8 occurs from 180 to 189. That's 10 numbers.\n   - Hundreds digit 2: 280-289. 10 numbers.\n   - Hundreds digit 3: 380-389. 10 numbers.\n   - Hundreds digit 4: Now, from 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480 to 488. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences.\n   - So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\n3. **Units place:** \n   - For each hundred, the units digit cycles. So, for hundreds digits 1,2,3,4, how many times does 8 appear in the units place.\n   - Hundreds digit 1: 108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198. That's 10 numbers.\n   - Hundreds digit 2: 208,218,...,298. 10 numbers.\n   - Hundreds digit 3: 308,318,...,398. 10 numbers.\n   - Hundreds digit 4: From 400-488, the units digit 8 occurs at 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Let's count: 408 is one, 418 is two, 428 is three, 438 is four, 448 is five, 458 is six, 468 is seven, 478 is eight, 488 is nine. So, 9 occurrences.\n   - So, total units place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit:0 (hundreds) +39 (tens) +39 (units) =78\nTotal 8's =1 +19 +78=98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Single-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:39+39=78. So, 1+19=20, 20+78=98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each step again quickly.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Single-digit:1 (correct)\n- Two-digit: tens 40-49:10, units 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94:9. Total 19. Correct.\n- Three-digit:\n  - Hundreds:400-488:89 (correct)\n  - Tens:140,240,340,440: each hundred contributes 10, but for hundreds=4, tens=4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 total. Correct.\n  - Units:104,114,...,194:10; 204,...,294:10; 304,...,394:10; 404,...,484:9. Total 39. Correct.\n  - So, 89+40+39=168. 1+19=20. 20+168=188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Single-digit:1 (correct)\n- Two-digit:80-89:10; units 18,28,...,98:9. Total 19. Correct.\n- Three-digit:\n  - Tens:180-189:10; 280-289:10; 380-389:10; 480-488:9. Total 39. Correct.\n  - Units:108,...,198:10; 208,...,298:10; 308,...,398:10; 408,...,488:9. Total 39. Correct.\n  - So, 39+39=78. 1+19=20. 20+78=98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " I'll consider each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, I think it's 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then the last partial group from 481 to 488, which doesn't include another 4 in the units place. Wait, no, 484 is within 481-488, so actually, the 48th group would end at 480, and then 481-488 would be the 49th group, but since 484 is within that, that's one more 4. So, total 49 times in the units place. Wait, let me check that again. From 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers, which is 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then from 481 to 488, that's 8 numbers. The units digits here are 1 to 8, so 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many times that is. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers long, so each contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So that's five ranges. Each contributes 10 4's, so 5 * 10 = 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, meaning 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but I'm supposed to count how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place, not how many numbers have 4 in that place. So, each of those 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to the 4's, but let's check. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then the last partial group from 481-488. In the units place of 481-488, the digits are 1 to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-488 is also in the book, but the tens digit there is 8, so 480-488 is another range. Let me count these ranges. From 0-99: 80-89 is one range (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), so that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, how many ranges? Let me list them:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9\n\nSo, total occurrences in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 plus 9 is 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, I think I accounted for all the ranges correctly.\n\nWait, another way to check: Maybe using a formula for digit counting. For each digit position, the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated as follows.\n\nFor units place: For each complete set of 10 numbers, the digit appears once. So, total number of complete sets is floor(488 / 10) = 48, contributing 48 times. Then, the remaining numbers are 488 % 10 = 8, so from 481 to 488, we check if the digit is present in the units place. Since 488 ends with 8, that's one more, so total 49.\n\nSame for tens place: For each complete set of 100 numbers, each digit appears 10 times in each ten's place. So, for 488, the number of complete sets is floor(488 / 100) = 4, contributing 4 * 10 = 40 times. Then, the remaining numbers are 488 % 100 = 88. So, in the tens place, from 400 to 488, how many times does 4 appear? Well, in the tens place, 400-409: 10 times, 410-419: 0, 420-429: 0, 430-439: 0, 440-449: 10 times, 450-459: 0, 460-469: 0, 470-479: 0, 480-488: 0 (since 480-488 have 8 in the tens place). Wait, no, actually, 440-449 would have 4 in the tens place, but 480-488 have 8 in the tens place. So, in the incomplete set, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 400 to 488, the tens digit is 0-8. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is entirely within 400-488, so that's 10 more. So, total for 4's in tens place: 4*10 + 10 = 50, which matches my earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: Using the formula, floor(488 / 100) = 4, contributing 4*10=40. Then, the remaining 88 numbers: from 400 to 488. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 40 + 9 = 49, which matches.\n\nSo, I think my counts are correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. For 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times. For 8's, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place, so 0.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 188.\n\nUnits place for 8's:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** For every 10 numbers, '4' appears once. There are 48 full groups of 10 (1-480) contributing 48 times. The last partial group (481-488) adds 1 more, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** '4' appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each range contributes 10 occurrences. There are 5 such ranges (including 440-449), totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, each number has '4' in the hundreds place, contributing 89 times.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to '4', '8' appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full groups and 1 in the last partial group, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** '8' appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each range contributes 10, except the last (480-488) which contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No page numbers have '8' in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 times more than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

That's 10 numbers: 40, 41, ..., 49. So that's 10 fours in the tens place. \n\nIn the units place, the 4 can appear every 10 numbers: 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but since we're only going up to 99, 44 is included, so that's 9 numbers? Wait, no, let me check. From 10 to 99, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, so 9 fours in the units place for two-digit numbers. \n\nWait, but 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 fours in the tens place, and 9 fours in the units place. So total for two-digit numbers, that's 10 + 9 = 19 fours. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. \n\nLet me break this down into hundreds, tens, and units places. \n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4, but 4 only goes up to 488, not 499. \n\nSo, for the hundreds place, how many times does 4 appear? It's from 400 to 488. So that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. \n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. We need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens digit. This can happen in two scenarios: when the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4, but we have to be careful with the upper limit. \n\nFor each hundreds digit (1, 2, 3, 4), the tens digit can be 0-9. But when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can only go up to 8 because the book ends at 488. \n\nSo, for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: each has 10 possibilities for the tens digit (0-9), so 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. That's 3 hundreds digits \u00d7 10 = 30 fours. \n\nFor the hundreds digit 4: the tens digit can be 0-8, so the tens digit 4 appears once (440-449). So that's 10 numbers (440-449), so 10 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but since the book goes up to 488, 449 is included. So that's 10 fours in the tens place for hundreds digit 4. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought the tens digit could go up to 8, but actually, the tens digit is 4, so regardless of the hundreds digit, as long as the tens digit is 4, it's allowed. So, for hundreds digits 1,2,3, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times each, so 3\u00d710=30. For hundreds digit 4, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (440-449). So total fours in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 30 + 10 = 40. \n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. Similarly, for each hundreds digit (1,2,3,4), and each tens digit (0-9), the units digit can be 0-9. So, for each hundreds digit, there are 10 possibilities for the tens digit, and for each of those, the units digit can be 4 once. So, for each hundreds digit, the units digit 4 appears 10 times (once every 10 numbers). \n\nSo, for hundreds digits 1,2,3: each has 10 occurrences, so 3\u00d710=30 fours. \n\nFor hundreds digit 4: again, the units digit 4 can appear in 400-488. How many times does the units digit 4 appear here? From 400 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488, so yes, 9 times. Wait, but wait, let's check: starting from 400, the first units digit 4 is 404, then every 10 pages: 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers. So, 9 fours in the units place for hundreds digit 4. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it's 10 per hundreds digit, but here it's 9. So, perhaps I need to adjust. So, for hundreds digits 1,2,3: each has 10 fours in the units place, so 3\u00d710=30. For hundreds digit 4: 9 fours. So total units place fours in three-digit numbers: 30 + 9 = 39. \n\nSo, total fours in three-digit numbers: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 fours. \n\nWait, let me check that again. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Tens place: 30 (from 1,2,3) +10 (from 4) =40. Units place: 30 (from 1,2,3) +9 (from 4) =39. So total 89+40+39=168 fours in three-digit numbers. \n\nNow, adding up all fours: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1 +19=20, 20+168=188 fours. \n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9): the only 8 is page 8, so that's 1 eight. \n\nTwo-digit page numbers (10-99): again, tens and units places. \n\nIn the tens place, 80-89: that's 10 numbers, so 10 eights. \n\nIn the units place, the 8 can appear every 10 numbers: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights. \n\nSo, total eights in two-digit numbers: 10 +9=19. \n\nNow, three-digit page numbers (100-488). \n\nHundreds place: 8 can appear only if the hundreds digit is 8, but since our book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can't be 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. \n\nTens place: for each hundreds digit (1,2,3,4), the tens digit can be 0-9. But when hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can only go up to 8. \n\nSo, for hundreds digits 1,2,3: each has 10 possibilities for the tens digit, so when the tens digit is 8, that's 10 numbers per hundreds digit. So, 3\u00d710=30 eights. \n\nFor hundreds digit 4: the tens digit can be 0-8, so the tens digit 8 appears once (480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, so 488 is included. So, the tens digit 8 in hundreds digit 4 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. Wait, but the tens digit is 8, so the numbers are 480-489, but since we stop at 488, it's 480-488. So, how many times does the tens digit 8 appear? It's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in hundreds digit 4. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it's 10, but since 488 is the last page, it's 9. So, total tens place eights in three-digit numbers: 30 (from 1,2,3) +9=39. \n\nNow, units place in three-digit numbers: for each hundreds digit (1,2,3,4), and each tens digit (0-9), the units digit can be 8. \n\nFor hundreds digits 1,2,3: each has 10 possibilities for the tens digit, and for each, the units digit 8 appears once. So, 10 per hundreds digit \u00d73=30 eights. \n\nFor hundreds digit 4: the units digit 8 can appear in 400-488. How many times? Let's see: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers. So, 9 eights in the units place for hundreds digit 4. \n\nSo, total units place eights in three-digit numbers: 30 (from 1,2,3) +9=39. \n\nTherefore, total eights in three-digit numbers: tens place (39) + units place (39)=78. \n\nAdding up all eights: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78)=1+19=20, 20+78=98 eights. \n\nWait, let me check that again. Single-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:78. So total eights:1+19=20, 20+78=98. \n\nNow, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. \n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems. \n\nStarting with fours: \n\nSingle-digit:1. \n\nTwo-digit: tens place (40-49)=10, units place (14,24,...,94)=9. So 19. \n\nThree-digit: hundreds place (400-488)=89. Tens place: for hundreds digits 1,2,3: each has 10, so 3\u00d710=30. For hundreds digit 4: tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449=10. So 30+10=40. Units place: for hundreds digits 1,2,3: each has 10, so 3\u00d710=30. For hundreds digit 4: units digit 4 occurs in 404,414,...,484=9. So 30+9=39. So total in three-digit:89+40+39=168. So total fours:1+19+168=188. \n\nEights: \n\nSingle-digit:1. \n\nTwo-digit: tens place (80-89)=10, units place (18,28,...,98)=9. So 19. \n\nThree-digit: tens place: hundreds digits 1,2,3: each has 10, so 3\u00d710=30. Hundreds digit 4: tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488=9. So 30+9=39. \n\nUnits place: hundreds digits 1,2,3: each has 10, so 3\u00d710=30. Hundreds digit 4: units digit 8 occurs in 408,418,...,488=9. So 30+9=39. \n\nTotal eights in three-digit:39+39=78. So total eights:1+19+78=98. \n\nDifference:188-98=90. \n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let's consider single-digit page numbers: 1-9. The only single-digit number with a 4 is 4 itself. So, that's 1 occurrence of the digit 4. \n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: 10-99. Here, the digit 4 can appear in the tens place or the units place. Let's calculate each separately. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers are 40-49. That's 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place. So, that's 10 occurrences. \n\nFor the units place: The numbers are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, each with a 4 in the units place. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, so does that mean I counted it twice? Hmm, actually, when I'm counting the occurrences, each digit is counted separately. So, in 44, both the tens and units place are 4, so that's two 4's. So, in the units place, from 14 to 94, every 10th number has a 4 in the units place, which gives 9 occurrences (since 10-99 is 90 numbers, and every 10th number is 9 times). Wait, no, actually, from 10-99, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so for each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, etc.), there's one 4 in the units place. There are 9 such groups (10-99), so 9 occurrences. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. \n\nWait, but when I think about 44, I'm counting two 4's, so maybe I should adjust. Let me check: in the tens place, 40-49 is 10 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the tens place, so that's 10. In the units place, from 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94, that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But 44 has both a tens and units 4, so in total, the number of 4's in the units place is 9, and in the tens place is 10, so total 19. But wait, 44 is counted in both, but each digit is counted separately, so that's correct. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers: 19. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100-488. Here, the digit 4 can appear in the hundreds place, tens place, or units place. Let's break it down by each place. \n\nFirst, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 for page numbers up to 488. So, from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. \n\nIn the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears only in the range 400-488. Let's see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. \n\nNext, tens place: The tens digit can be 0-9, and we're looking for when it's 4. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9. So, in 100-199, the tens digit is 4 in 140-149, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 200-299, it's 240-249, another 10 numbers. In 300-399, it's 340-349, another 10. And in 400-488, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers (since 440-449 is within 400-488). So, total 4's in the tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-449) = 40. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 40 occurrences. \n\nNow, units place: Similarly, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens group. So, in each hundred, for each tens group, there's a units digit of 4 once every 10 numbers. So, in 100-199, the units digit is 4 in 104,114,124,...,194. That's 10 numbers. Similarly, in 200-299, it's 204,214,...,294: 10 numbers. In 300-399, 304,314,...,394: 10 numbers. In 400-488, the units digit is 4 in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Wait, let's count how many that is. From 404 to 484, stepping by 10, that's (484 - 404)/10 + 1 = (80)/10 +1 = 8 +1=9 numbers. So, in 400-488, there are 9 numbers where the units digit is 4. So, total units place 4's: 10 (100-199) +10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+9 (400-488)=39. \n\nWait, but let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so for the units digit, how many times does 4 appear? It's every 10 numbers, so 89 /10 is 8 full cycles, giving 8*1=8, but then there's a partial cycle from 480-488, which includes 484, so that's one more, making 9. So, yes, 9 occurrences. So, total units place 4's: 39. \n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89+40=129+39=168. \n\nWait, let me add that again: 89 (hundreds) +40 (tens)=129, plus 39 (units)=168. So, 168 4's in three-digit page numbers. \n\nNow, let's total all 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1+19=20+168=188. So, 188 4's in total. \n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach. \n\nSingle-digit page numbers: 1-9. The only single-digit number with an 8 is 8 itself. So, 1 occurrence. \n\nTwo-digit page numbers: 10-99. The digit 8 can be in the tens place or units place. \n\nTens place: 80-89. That's 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place, so 10 occurrences. \n\nUnits place: The numbers are 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the units place. Wait, 88 has two 8's, so does that affect the count? No, because each digit is counted separately. So, in the units place, from 18 to 98, every 10th number has an 8 in the units place, which is 9 occurrences (since 10-99 is 90 numbers, so 90/10=9). So, units place 8's: 9. \n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) +9 (units)=19. \n\nNow, three-digit page numbers: 100-488. Let's break it down by each digit place. \n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1,2,3, or 4. Since 8 is not among these, the hundreds place doesn't contribute any 8's. So, 0 occurrences. \n\nTens place: The tens digit can be 0-9. We need to find when it's 8. So, for each hundred, the tens digit is 8 in the range X80-X89. \n\nIn 100-199: 180-189, which is 10 numbers. \n\nIn 200-299: 280-289, another 10. \n\nIn 300-399: 380-389, another 10. \n\nIn 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488-480+1=9). So, in the tens place, 480-488 contributes 9 occurrences. \n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 (100-199) +10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+9 (400-488)=39. \n\nUnits place: The units digit is 8. So, for each hundred, in each tens group, the units digit cycles 0-9, so every 10 numbers, the units digit is 8 once. \n\nIn 100-199: 108,118,128,...,198. That's 10 numbers. \n\nIn 200-299: 208,218,...,298. Another 10. \n\nIn 300-399: 308,318,...,398. Another 10. \n\nIn 400-488: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Let's count how many that is. From 408 to 488, stepping by 10, that's (488 - 408)/10 +1= (80)/10 +1=8+1=9 numbers. \n\nSo, units place 8's: 10 (100-199)+10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+9 (400-488)=39. \n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place (39) + units place (39)=78. \n\nWait, but let me check: in the tens place, we had 39, and in the units place, 39, so total 78 8's in three-digit numbers. \n\nNow, total 8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) =1+19=20+78=98. \n\nSo, total 8's:98. \n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. \n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90. \n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFirst, 4's: \n\nSingle-digit:1 \n\nTwo-digit:19 \n\nThree-digit:168 \n\nTotal:1+19=20+168=188. \n\n8's: \n\nSingle-digit:1 \n\nTwo-digit:19 \n\nThree-digit:78 \n\nTotal:1+19=20+78=98. \n\nDifference:188-98=90. \n\nHmm, seems correct. \n\nWait, but let me check the three-digit 4's again. \n\nHundreds place:400-488:89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place:89. \n\nTens place: in each hundred (100-199, etc.), 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, so 4 hundreds (100-399 and 400-488). Wait, no, 100-199,200-299,300-399: each has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, so 3*10=30. Then, 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's:30+10=40. \n\nUnits place: in each hundred, 10 numbers with 4 in the units place, so 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, and 400-488:9, as 484 is the last one. So, 10+10+10+9=39. \n\nSo, 89+40+39=168, which is correct. \n\nSimilarly, for 8's: \n\nHundreds place: none, since hundreds digits are 1-4. \n\nTens place: in each hundred (100-199, etc.), 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, so 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, and 400-488:9 (480-488). So, 10+10+10+9=39. \n\nUnits place: in each hundred, 10 numbers with 8 in the units place, so 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, and 400-488:9 (408,418,...,488). So, 10+10+10+9=39. \n\nSo, 39+39=78 in three-digit numbers. \n\nAdding single and two-digit:1+19=20, so total 8's:20+78=98. \n\nThus, 4's:188, 8's:98, difference=90. \n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - Only page 4: 1 occurrence.\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** Pages 40-49: 10 occurrences.\n   - **Units place:** Pages 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94: 9 occurrences.\n   - **Total for two-digit pages:** 10 + 9 = 19.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488: 89 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** Pages 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: 10 each, totaling 40.\n   - **Units place:** Pages 104, 114, ..., 484: 10 in 100-399 and 9 in 400-488, totaling 39.\n   - **Total for three-digit pages:** 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\n**Total '4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit '8':**\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - Only page 8: 1 occurrence.\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** Pages 80-89: 10 occurrences.\n   - **Units place:** Pages 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98: 9 occurrences.\n   - **Total for two-digit pages:** 10 + 9 = 19.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** No occurrence since hundreds digits are 1-4.\n   - **Tens place:** Pages 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488: 10 each for first three, 9 for last, totaling 39.\n   - **Units place:** Pages 108, 118, ..., 488: 10 each for first three hundreds, 9 for 400-488, totaling 39.\n   - **Total for three-digit pages:** 39 + 39 = 78.\n\n**Total '8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let's consider single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears exactly once, on page 4. So, that's one 4. \n\nNext, for two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, the digits can be in the tens place or the units place. I think I should break this down into two parts: the tens place and the units place. \n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers, the 4 can appear in the tens digit, which would be from 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so that's 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. \n\nFor the units place in two-digit numbers, the 4 can appear in any of the numbers where the units digit is 4, like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but since we're only going up to 99, that's from 10 to 99, so from 14 to 94, stepping by 10 each time. Let me count how many that is. From 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences of the digit 4 in the units place. \n\nWait, but wait, 44 has both the tens and units digit as 4. So, in the tens place, I counted 10, and in the units place, I counted 9. So, in total, for two-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 + 9 = 19 times. \n\nWait, but when I count 44, I think I might have double-counted it. Let me check: in the tens place, 40-49 gives 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place, including 44. Then, in the units place, 14, 24, ..., 94, which includes 44 again. So, yes, 44 is counted twice, once in each category. But that's correct because 44 has two 4's. So, that's okay. So, the total number of 4's in two-digit numbers is indeed 19.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because each number has hundreds, tens, and units digits. I'll need to consider each digit place separately: hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, let's see how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be any digit from 0 to 9, and we need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. For each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 exactly 10 times. But wait, for 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, but the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears from 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers. \n\nWait, let me clarify. For each hundred group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each. So, that's 3 hundreds groups, each contributing 10, so 3*10=30. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total for the tens place is 30 + 10 = 40. Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so the tens digit goes up to 8, so 440-449 is valid, but 450-459 would be beyond 488, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit 4 in 400-488 is only from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 30 from the first three hundreds and 10 from the 400-488 group, so 40 total.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. Similarly, the units digit cycles through 0-9 for each tens and hundreds digit. So, for each hundreds group, the units digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, in each hundreds group, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? For example, in 100-199, the numbers ending with 4 are 104, 114, 124, ..., 194, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 200-299, it's 204, 214, ..., 294, another 10. In 300-399, it's 304, 314, ..., 394, another 10. Now, in 400-488, the units digit 4 appears in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, but 484 is within 488, so that's 9 numbers because 404 to 484 is every 10, so 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. So that's 9 times. \n\nWait, so for each of the first three hundreds, it's 10 times, and for the 400-488 group, it's 9 times. So, total units digit 4's in three-digit numbers: 3*10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 100-399, each hundred has 10 units digit 4's, so 3*10=30. From 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs at 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 404 is the first, then each 10 after that, up to 484. Since 484 +10=494, which is beyond 488, so yes, 9 times. So total units digit 4's: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me recount the units digit 4's in 400-488. Starting from 400, the first number ending with 4 is 404. Then, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. So that's 9 numbers. So, 9 is correct.\n\nSo, for three-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times (from 400-488)\n- Tens place: 40 times (30 from 100-399, 10 from 400-488)\n- Units place: 39 times (30 from 100-399, 9 from 400-488)\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, for the tens place, I had 3 hundreds groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contributing 10, so 30, and then 400-488 contributing another 10, so 40 total. Similarly, for units place, 3 hundreds groups contributing 10 each, so 30, and 400-488 contributing 9, so 39 total. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total number of 4's in three-digit numbers is 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. So, 168 4's in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again, especially for the three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400-488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place for three-digit numbers, I had 30 from 100-399 and 10 from 400-488, so 40. That seems correct.\n\nIn the units place, 30 from 100-399 and 9 from 400-488, so 39. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. So, 168 4's in three-digit numbers. Plus 19 in two-digit and 1 in single-digit, total 188. Hmm, that seems plausible.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: 8 appears once, on page 8. So, that's one 8.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: from 10 to 99.\n\nIn the tens place, 8 appears in 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nIn the units place, 8 appears in 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 88 has both digits as 8, so that's counted twice, once in tens and once in units. So, total 10 + 9 = 19 8's in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, three-digit numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, how many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Well, 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nTens place: Let's consider each hundreds group.\n\nFor 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nIn each of these, the tens digit 8 appears in a block of 10 numbers. For example, in 100-199, the tens digit 8 is in 180-189, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 200-299, it's 280-289, another 10. In 300-399, it's 380-389, another 10. In 400-488, the tens digit 8 would be in 480-488, but wait, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but our book stops at 488, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers. So, in the 400-488 group, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens digit 8's: 3 hundreds groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contributing 10, so 3*10=30, plus 9 from 400-488, totaling 39.\n\nUnits place: Similarly, for each hundreds group, the units digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n\nIn 100-199: 108, 118, 128, ..., 198. That's 10 numbers.\n\nIn 200-299: 208, 218, ..., 298. Another 10.\n\nIn 300-399: 308, 318, ..., 398. Another 10.\n\nIn 400-488: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included, and the next would be 498, which is beyond 488.\n\nSo, units digit 8's: 3*10 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, for three-digit numbers, the digit 8 appears:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 39\n- Units place: 39\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, in the tens place, I had 30 from the first three hundreds and 9 from 400-488, so 39. Similarly, in the units place, it's 30 from the first three hundreds and 9 from 400-488, so 39. So, total 8's in three-digit numbers: 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For the tens place, 30 from 100-399 and 9 from 400-488, so 39. For the units place, same thing: 30 from 100-399 and 9 from 400-488, so 39. So, 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 4).\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place: 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n- Units place: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94: 9 numbers, so 9 4's.\nTotal two-digit: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n- Tens place: 100-399: 3 hundreds, each with 10, so 30. 400-488: 440-449: 10. So, 30 +10=40.\n- Units place: 100-399: 3 hundreds, each with 10, so 30. 400-488: 404,414,...,484: 9. So, 30 +9=39.\nTotal three-digit: 89 +40 +39=168.\n\nTotal 4's: 1 +19 +168=188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 8).\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place: 80-89:10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n- Units place:18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98:9 numbers, so 9 8's.\nTotal two-digit:10 +9=19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds place:0.\n- Tens place:100-399:3 hundreds, each with 10, so 30. 400-488:480-488:9 numbers, so 9. Total:30 +9=39.\n- Units place:100-399:3 hundreds, each with 10, so 30. 400-488:408,418,...,488:9 numbers, so 9. Total:30 +9=39.\nTotal three-digit:39 +39=78.\n\nTotal 8's:1 +19 +78=98.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** The digit 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 40-49 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n     - Tens place: 100-399 (3 sets of 10) + 440-449 \u2192 30 + 10 = 40.\n     - Units place: 100-399 (3 sets of 10) + 404,414,...,484 \u2192 30 + 9 = 39.\n     - Total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n   - **Total 4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** The digit 8 appears once (page 8).\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 80-89 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n     - Tens place: 100-399 (3 sets of 10) + 480-488 \u2192 30 + 9 = 39.\n     - Units place: 100-399 (3 sets of 10) + 408,418,...,488 \u2192 30 + 9 = 39.\n     - Total: 39 + 39 = 78.\n   - **Total 8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 more times than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9): The digit 4 appears once, which is on page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence. \n\nNext, two-digit page numbers (10-99): Here, the digits can be in the tens place or the units place. Let's consider each separately. \n\nFor the tens place: The tens digit is 4 for pages 40-49. That's 10 pages, so 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. \n\nFor the units place: The units digit is 4 for every 10 pages, so in each set of 10 (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), there's one 4. There are 9 sets (10-19 up to 90-99), so 9 occurrences. Wait, no, actually, from 10-99, there are 9 decades (10s, 20s, ..., 90s). So, in each decade, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so each digit appears once in the units place per decade. Therefore, for 4 in the units place, there are 9 occurrences (40, 41, ..., 49, but wait, no, that's the tens place. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me correct that. \n\nWait, when considering the units digit, for two-digit numbers, the units digit cycles from 0-9 in each set of ten. So, for each set of ten (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. Since there are 9 sets (from 10-19 up to 90-99), that's 9 times. So, 9 occurrences in the units place. \n\nWait, but 40-49 would have the tens digit as 4, which we've already counted as 10 occurrences. So, for two-digit numbers, the number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 occurrences. \n\nWait, but hold on, 40-49 is a full set of 10, so that's correct. So, 10 in the tens place, and 9 in the units place elsewhere. So, 19 in total for two-digit numbers. \n\nNow, for three-digit page numbers (100-488): Here, the page numbers range from 100 to 488. So, each page number is a three-digit number, ABC, where A is the hundreds digit, B is the tens digit, and C is the units digit. \n\nI need to count how many times 4 appears in each position. \n\nFirst, let's handle the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, but 4 only goes up to 488, not 499. \n\nSo, for hundreds digit being 4: Pages 400-488. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, so 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. \n\nNext, the tens place: For each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), we can look at the tens digit. \n\nFor each hundreds group, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 pages. So, in each group, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 pages (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). \n\nBut for the 400-488 group, the tens digit goes up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8, so the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 pages (440-449). \n\nSo, for each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each. So, that's 3 groups \u00d7 10 = 30 occurrences. \n\nIn the 400-488 group, as mentioned, it's also 10 occurrences. So, total in the tens place for three-digit numbers is 30 + 10 = 40 occurrences. \n\nWait, but wait, 400-488 is part of the hundreds digit being 4, which we already considered in the hundreds place. But when considering the tens digit, regardless of the hundreds digit, we can have 4 in the tens place. So, yes, for each hundreds group, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and since there are 4 hundreds groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), but wait, 400-488 isn't a full hundred; it's only up to 488. However, for the tens digit, in 400-488, the tens digit can go up to 8, so 4 in the tens place would be 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, yes, 10 occurrences. So, total for tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 occurrences. \n\nNow, the units place for three-digit numbers: Similarly, in each hundreds group, the units digit cycles 0-9 every page. So, in each hundreds group, the digit 4 appears once every 10 pages in the units place. \n\nSo, for each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the units digit 4 appears 10 times per group. \n\nWait, but let's check. For 100-199, the units digit 4 appears on 104, 114, 124, ..., 194. That's 10 times. Similarly for 200-299, 204, 214, ..., 294: 10 times. Same for 300-399: 304, 314, ..., 394: 10 times. \n\nNow, for 400-488, the units digit 4 appears on 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, but 484 is within 488, so that's 9 times? Wait, no, let me count: starting from 404, adding 10 each time: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times because 484 +10 would be 494, which is beyond 488. So, only 9 occurrences in the units place for 400-488. \n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. So, in the hundreds groups 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each have 10 occurrences of 4 in the units place, but 400-488 only has 9. So, total units place occurrences would be 3\u00d710 +9=39. \n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me check. For 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 times because 484 is the last one before 494, which is beyond 488. So, yes, 9 times. \n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's in the units place for three-digit numbers is 3\u00d710 +9=39. \n\nSo, for three-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89+40=129, 129+39=168. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. 89 in hundreds, 40 in tens, 39 in units: 89+40=129, 129+39=168. So, 168 occurrences of 4 in three-digit numbers. \n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1+19=20, 20+168=188. So, total 4's are 188. \n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process. \n\nSingle-digit page numbers (1-9): The digit 8 appears once, on page 8. So, 1 occurrence. \n\nTwo-digit page numbers (10-99): Again, tens and units places. \n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 for pages 80-89. That's 10 pages, so 10 occurrences. \n\nUnits place: The units digit is 8 for every 10 pages, so in each set of 10 (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), the digit 8 appears once in the units place. There are 9 sets, so 9 occurrences. \n\nWait, but in the tens place, 80-89 is 10 occurrences, and in the units place, it's 9 occurrences. So, total 10+9=19 occurrences of 8 in two-digit numbers. \n\nNow, three-digit page numbers (100-488): Let's break it down by hundreds, tens, and units places. \n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 for pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. \n\nTens place: For each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit is 8 for pages ending with 80-89. \n\nIn 100-199: 180-189, which is 10 pages, so 10 occurrences. \n\nSimilarly, 200-299: 280-289, 10 occurrences. \n\n300-399: 380-389, 10 occurrences. \n\n400-488: Here, the tens digit can be 8, so pages 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, 8 appears for 9 pages (480-488). \n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 pages: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, 9 occurrences. \n\nTherefore, total in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) +10 (200-299) +10 (300-399) +9 (400-488) = 39 occurrences. \n\nNow, units place for three-digit numbers: In each hundreds group, the units digit 8 appears once every 10 pages. \n\nSo, for 100-199: 108,118,...,198. That's 10 occurrences. \n\nSimilarly, 200-299: 208,218,...,298: 10 occurrences. \n\n300-399: 308,318,...,398: 10 occurrences. \n\n400-488: Now, units digit 8 appears on 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Let's count: starting from 408, adding 10 each time until we reach 488. \n\n408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 occurrences because 488 is included, and the next would be 498, which is beyond 488. \n\nSo, units place occurrences: 10 (100-199) +10 (200-299) +10 (300-399) +9 (400-488) = 39 occurrences. \n\nSo, total number of 8's in three-digit numbers is tens place (39) + units place (39) = 78 occurrences. \n\nWait, but wait, let me check that again. For each hundreds group, the tens place and units place each have their own counts. So, in the tens place, we had 39, and in the units place, we had 39. So, total 39+39=78. \n\nNow, adding up all the 8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) = 1+19=20, 20+78=98. So, total 8's are 98. \n\nWait, but let me double-check the three-digit counts for 8's. \n\nIn the tens place: \n\n- 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 pages \u2192 10 occurrences. \n- 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 pages \u2192 10 occurrences. \n- 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 pages \u2192 10 occurrences. \n- 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 pages \u2192 9 occurrences. \n\nTotal tens place: 10+10+10+9=39. \n\nIn the units place: \n\n- 100-199: 108,118,...,198 \u2192 10 occurrences. \n- 200-299: 208,218,...,298 \u2192 10 occurrences. \n- 300-399: 308,318,...,398 \u2192 10 occurrences. \n- 400-488: 408,418,...,488 \u2192 9 occurrences. \n\nTotal units place: 10+10+10+9=39. \n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: 39+39=78. \n\nAdding single and two-digit: 1+19=20, 20+78=98. So, 98 8's in total. \n\nNow, the number of 4's was 188, and the number of 8's is 98. \n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. \n\nFor 4's: \n\n- Single-digit:1 \n- Two-digit:19 \n- Three-digit:168 \nTotal:1+19=20, 20+168=188. \n\nFor 8's: \n\n- Single-digit:1 \n- Two-digit:19 \n- Three-digit:78 \nTotal:1+19=20, 20+78=98. \n\nDifference:188-98=90. \n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. \n\nWait, but let me check the three-digit counts again to ensure I didn't overcount. \n\nIn the hundreds place for 4's: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 4's. \n\nTens place: For each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), 10 each, so 4\u00d710=40. \n\nUnits place: 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9, total 39. \n\nSo, 89+40+39=168. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nFor 8's: \n\nHundreds place:0. \n\nTens place:10+10+10+9=39. \n\nUnits place:10+10+10+9=39. \n\nTotal:78. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSo, 188-98=90. \n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let's consider single-digit page numbers. These are from 1 to 9. The only single-digit page that has a 4 is page 4 itself. So, that's one 4. \n\nNext, let's look at two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, the digits can be in the tens place or the units place. I'll need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. \n\nFor the tens place: The two-digit numbers where the tens digit is 4 are from 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. \n\nFor the units place: The two-digit numbers where the units digit is 4 are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Let's count these. From 10 to 99, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so 4 appears once every 10 numbers. Since there are 9 sets of 10 in two-digit numbers (10-99), that's 9 times. But wait, 44 has two 4's, so in the units place, we have 9 occurrences, but one of them is in 44, which we've already counted in the tens place. Wait, no, actually, when counting the units place, we should count all numbers where the units digit is 4, regardless of the tens digit. So, from 10 to 99, the units digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so that's 9 times (14,24,...,94). Wait, but 44 is included here as well, so that's 9 times. But in the tens place, 40-49 gives 10 times, and 44 is included in both counts, but when we're counting total 4's, each digit is counted separately, so 44 contributes two 4's. So, when I add the tens and units, I should get 10 + 9 = 19 4's in two-digit numbers. Wait, but 44 is counted twice, once in the tens and once in the units, so that's correct because it has two 4's. So, 19 4's in two-digit numbers. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Here, each page number has three digits: hundreds, tens, and units. I'll need to consider each place separately.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, let's see how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Pages 400 to 488 have 4 in the hundreds place. That's 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place: Now, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488. \n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, and 4:\n\n- For hundreds digit 1: The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each hundred. So, in 100-199, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 140-149. So, 10 occurrences.\n- Similarly, for hundreds digits 2, 3: Each will have 10 occurrences in their respective hundreds (200-299, 300-399). So, that's 10 each, so 20 so far.\n- For hundreds digit 4: The tens digit is 4, but we have to consider that the page numbers go up to 488. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 would be from 440-449. That's 10 numbers. However, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so does that affect the tens place? No, because 440-449 is within 400-488, so it's fine. So, total tens place 4's: 10 (for 100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-449) = 40 occurrences.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check again. For hundreds digits 1,2,3, each has 10 occurrences in the tens place, so 3 * 10 = 30. For hundreds digit 4, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. So total is 30 +10=40. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the units place: How many times does 4 appear in the units place for three-digit numbers from 100 to 488?\n\nAgain, for each hundreds group, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the units place.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 100-199. Units digit 4 occurs in 104,114,...,194. That's 10 times.\n- Similarly, hundreds digits 2,3: Each has 10 occurrences, so 20 more.\n- For hundreds digit 4: 400-488. The units digit 4 occurs in 404,414,...,484. How many is that? Let's see: from 400 to 488, the units digit 4 appears every 10 numbers. So, 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 times because 484 is the last one before 488. Wait, 404 is the first, then adding 10 each time up to 484. So, from 404 to 484 is 9 numbers because (484 - 404)/10 +1 = (80)/10 +1=8+1=9. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total units place 4's: 10 (hundreds 1) +10 (hundreds 2)+10 (hundreds 3) +9 (hundreds 4) = 39.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For hundreds digit 4, units digit 4 occurs in 404,414,...,484. Let me count them: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, as I thought. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total three-digit 4's: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89+40=129+39=168.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 89 (hundreds) +40 (tens)=129, plus 39 (units)=168. So, 168 4's in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit:168\nTotal 4's=1+19=20+168=188.\n\nWait, 1+19 is 20, plus 168 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: from 1 to 9. The only single-digit number with an 8 is 8 itself. So, that's one 8.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: from 10 to 99.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 for numbers 80-89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: The units digit is 8 for numbers 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers because from 10 to 99, each ten has one number ending with 8, so 9 times (since 88 is included in both tens and units, but we're counting each digit separately). Wait, actually, from 10 to 99, the units digit 8 appears in 18,28,...,98, which is 9 numbers (since 10-99 is 90 numbers, so 90/10=9). So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total two-digit 8's: 10 (tens) +9 (units)=19.\n\nNow, three-digit page numbers: from 100 to 488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no three-digit page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nTens place: Now, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place across three-digit numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nFor each hundreds group (100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488):\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: The tens digit is 8 for 180-189. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n- Hundreds digit 2: Similarly, 280-289: 10 occurrences.\n- Hundreds digit 3: 380-389: 10 occurrences.\n- Hundreds digit 4: Now, 480-488. The tens digit is 8, so from 480 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 (hundreds 1) +10 (hundreds 2)+10 (hundreds 3)+9 (hundreds 4)=39.\n\nUnits place: Now, how many times does 8 appear in the units place for three-digit numbers from 100 to 488?\n\nAgain, for each hundreds group:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: Units digit 8 occurs in 108,118,...,198. That's 10 numbers.\n- Hundreds digit 2: 208,218,...,298: 10 numbers.\n- Hundreds digit 3: 308,318,...,398: 10 numbers.\n- Hundreds digit 4: 408,418,...,488. Now, 488 is included, so let's see how many numbers. From 408 to 488, stepping by 10: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because (488-408)/10 +1=80/10 +1=8+1=9.\n\nSo, units place 8's: 10 (hundreds 1)+10 (hundreds 2)+10 (hundreds 3)+9 (hundreds 4)=39.\n\nSo, total three-digit 8's: tens place (39) + units place (39)=78.\n\nNow, summing up all the 8's:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit:78\nTotal 8's=1+19=20+78=98.\n\nWait, 1+19 is 20, plus 78 is 98. So, 98 8's in total.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, checking the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit:168\nTotal 4's=1+19=20+168=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit:78\nTotal 8's=1+19=20+78=98. Correct.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me just verify the three-digit counts again because that's where most of the digits are.\n\nFor 4's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place:400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n- Tens place:10 (hundreds 1) +10 (2)+10 (3)+10 (4)=40.\n- Units place:10 (1)+10 (2)+10 (3)+9 (4)=39.\nTotal:89+40+39=168. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place:0\n- Tens place:10+10+10+9=39\n- Units place:10+10+10+9=39\nTotal:39+39=78. Correct.\n\nYes, so the difference is indeed 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - Only page 4 has a 4.\n   - Total: 1\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** Pages 40-49 (10 occurrences).\n   - **Units place:** Pages 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94 (9 occurrences).\n   - Total: 10 + 9 = 19\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 (89 occurrences).\n   - **Tens place:** Each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributes 10, and 400-488 contributes 10 (pages 440-449).\n     - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40\n   - **Units place:** Each hundred contributes 10, except 400-488, which contributes 9 (pages 404, 414, ..., 484).\n     - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n   - Total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n\n**Total 4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - Only page 8 has an 8.\n   - Total: 1\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** Pages 80-89 (10 occurrences).\n   - **Units place:** Pages 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98 (9 occurrences).\n   - Total: 10 + 9 = 19\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488.\n   - **Tens place:** Each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributes 10, and 400-488 contributes 9 (pages 480-488).\n     - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n   - **Units place:** Each hundred contributes 10, except 400-488, which contributes 9 (pages 408, 418, ..., 488).\n     - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n   - Total: 39 + 39 = 78\n\n**Total 8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
