    "text": " Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in units place. So 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 484 is included, that's 49. That seems right. Tens place: Each hundred has 10, and there are 5 hundreds (0-4), so 5*10=50. But wait, does 0-99 count as the first hundred? Yes, so 40-49 is in 0-99, then 140-149 in 100-199, etc., up to 440-449 in 400-499. Since the book goes up to 488, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last one is 488, which is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 8. Wait, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so that's 49 numbers. So units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of this. So, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many hundreds? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers), 100-199: 180-189 (10), 200-299:280-289 (10), 300-399:380-389 (10), and 400-488:480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last page). Wait, so the first four sets are 10 each, but the last set is only 9 because 489 isn't included. So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So that's 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights: 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, let me confirm. Units place: 8,18,...,488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. That's correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. Hundreds place: 0. So total eights: 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). This gives 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488) which contributes 9. This gives 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers are there? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last block, which might be shorter. Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10*4 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yeah, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 =9). Wait, no, 480-488 is actually 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, how many blocks? Let's see, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total eights in the tens place would be 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, but is that correct? Because each hundred block up to 300 has 10, and then 480-488 is 9. So, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. Let me recheck the fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, did I count the hundreds place correctly for the eights? Since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers from 800-899, so yes, hundreds place for 8 is zero. Also, for the tens place, when I counted 480-488 as 9 numbers, that's correct because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, that part is correct. Therefore, the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Wait, but 480-489 would be the next, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, how many 8's? Each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, and there are 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive).

Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. To find how many, divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, every 10 numbers adds one. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Let's count how many sets: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me make sure. Each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place except the last one, which only goes up to 488. So, 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each have 10 eights in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Let me double-check the counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yes, that seems right.

So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through the counts again. For fours: Units: from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,...,484. How many? The formula is floor((484 - 4)/10) +1 = floor(480/10)+1=48+1=49. That's correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 488 - 400 +1 =89. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: Units:8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. How many? (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks is 10 numbers, the last is 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, since 800+ is beyond 488. So, 49+49=98. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Units place: from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in units? Every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, does that add an extra 4? Wait, 488 is in the units place as 8, so maybe it's just 48 times. Wait, let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 fours. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no additional 4 in the units place. So, units place is 48 fours, not 49. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. So, units place: 48 fours. Tens place: as before, 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, total fours: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Wait, that's different from my initial calculation. Let me confirm: units place: 48 fours. Tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. Total: 48+50=98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing an 8 in the units place, and then in 488, the units digit is 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, the total number of 4's is 187, and the total number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 48 occurrences (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, taking the integer part).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, plus the extra 8 in 488).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488.\n   - Each full block contributes 10 occurrences, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place within 488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **89**\n\n\\boxed{89}"

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 =49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. Each hundred block up to 400 would have 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49, which matches what I had before. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours. Units: from 4,14,...,484. How many? The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) +1. So, (488-4)=484, divided by 10 is 48.4, floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, units:49. Tens: from 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block of 100 has 10 fours in the tens place, so 400-488: wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, but the tens digit being 4 occurs in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, 50. Hundreds: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. So, 49+50+89=188. That's correct. For eights: units: from 8,18,...,488. How many? (488-8)/10=48, +1=49. Tens: from 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each block of 100 contributes 10, except the last which contributes 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range. So, each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers). Wait, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, the tens digit is 8 in 9 numbers here. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me check the counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484), totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488), totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which we take as 48 full occurrences, but wait, 48*10 is 480, so the next number would be 484, which is within 488. So, 48 full tens give 48 fours, and then the 49th is at 484. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: as before, 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, we subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. The last number is 488, which is in the units place. So, how many? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but including 488, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is 488, so units digit is 8, so yes, that's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count each set. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 +10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me make sure: 80-89 is 10, each of the next three sets (180-189, etc.) is 10 each, so that's 4 sets of 10, which is 40, plus the last set 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total is 40 +9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, I subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours -98 eights=90. Wait, but let me check my calculations again to be sure. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. And for the tens place, 40-49, 140-149, etc., each set has 10 numbers, and there are 5 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. So, tens place is 50. Units place: 49. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units place: from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set is only 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I just thought, in the tens place for eights, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page. So, yes, 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, that's correct.

    "text": " Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. Okay, moving on to counting the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. Wait, 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me check: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is the 49th occurrence, right? Because 8*1=8, 8*2=16, but wait, actually, the units digit cycles every 10, so from 0 to 488, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) + 1 if 488 mod 10 >=8. 488 mod 10 is 8, which is equal to 8, so we add 1. So floor(488/10)=48, plus 1 is 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 489 is beyond 488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me think again. From 0-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but earlier I thought the tens place was 49, so total eights would be 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Let me check again to make sure I didn't miss anything. Units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0. So total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Counting fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Counting eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't overcount in the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For the tens place, fours: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each of those is 10 numbers, and there are 5 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). 5*10=50, that's correct. Units place for fours: every 10 numbers, from 4,14,...,484. How many? 484 is the last one, which is 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct. For eights, units place: 8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place for eights: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10, and the last set has 9 (since 488 is the last page). So 4*10 +9=49. Correct.

Wait, no, actually, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, the tens place has 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488).

So, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4*10=40 plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 49, so total eights:49+49=98.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. The units digit is 8 in numbers like 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? From 8 to 488, step 10. So, the number of terms is ((488 -8)/10) +1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place:49. Tens place:49. So total eights:98.\n\nNow, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours. Let me recount:\n\nUnits place: 4,14,24,...,484. That's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct.\n\nTens place: 40-49 (10),140-149(10),240-249(10),340-349(10),440-449(10). So, 5 sets of 10:50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:400-488. 488-400+1=89. Correct.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188.\n\nEights:\n\nUnits:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488.

I'll do the same approach, looking at units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence in units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The first is 8, which is 8 = 8 + 10*0, and the last is 488 = 8 + 10*48. So, the number of terms is 49. Because 0 to 48 is 49 terms. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. To find how many, divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers.

So, how many sets do we have? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, the first four sets have 10 each, and the last set has 9.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me double-check.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? Let's see: 488 - 8 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 gives 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is within 488, so let's count each block. Each block from x80-x89 has 10 numbers, except possibly the last one if it's cut short. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers). So, that's 10 + 10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Wait, let me double-check the tens place. For 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So that's 9, correct. So, 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one block of 9 (480-488), so 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Now, total fours are 188, eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. And in the tens place, 50 fours. Units:49. So 188 total fours. For eights, units:49, tens:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. Okay, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers because from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets we have. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 =40 plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me make sure. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me check if I missed anything. Wait, when counting the tens place for eights, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers. Let me confirm: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, right? 480 is the first, then 481,482,...,488. So, 488-480+1=9. So, that's correct. Also, in the hundreds place for fours, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers. 488-400+1=89. Correct. So, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Yes, but since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 is part of that. So, let's count how many sets of 100 have 8 in the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 occurrences (since 488 is included). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let's calculate each block. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for 4's. Let me check again. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50. That's correct. For the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. Let's see, 484 is the last one. So, how many numbers is that? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 fours in units place. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place is 8,18,...,488. So, same as fours, 49 eights. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, first four blocks are 10 each, and the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm getting 90 as the difference. But let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, right? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in hundreds place. That seems correct. So, the difference is 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in different places, it's easy to miscount. Let me try another approach to verify. Alternatively, I can count the number of 4's and 8's digit by digit for each position. Let's start with the units digit. For 4's: As before, every 10 numbers, so 4,14,...,484. How many terms? Let's see, 4 + 10*(n-1)=484. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Similarly, for 8's: 8,18,...,488. Same calculation: 8 +10*(n-1)=488. 10*(n-1)=480, n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Now, tens place for 4's: numbers where tens digit is 4. These are 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50. For 8's: tens digit is 8 in 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. First four blocks have 10 each, last block has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Now, hundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. For 8's: hundreds digit is 8 only in 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so no eights in hundreds place. So, 0. So, total fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188. Total eights:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98. Difference:188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90.

I'll go through each digit position as well: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10 each time. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full steps, but including both 8 and 488, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), but wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, it's 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, etc.) plus 9 from 480-488. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9 = 49.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me make sure. Units:49, Tens:49, so 98. Yes, that's correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

I'll go through each digit position again: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49.

Wait, but 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let me count how many such sets there are. Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. Then, the last block 480-488 has 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 +9=49.

So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with an additional 9 in 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.  \nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. That's correct. Tens place: each hundred has 10, and there are 4 hundreds (1-400, 401-800 but wait, the book only goes to 488). Wait, no, the hundreds place is 4 only in 400-488. So, the tens place 4's would be in 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). So that's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8's appear in 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the first is 8, the last is 488. How many terms? Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 (480,481,...,488). So, total 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. Correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: \\( \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, totaling \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\nTotal 4's: \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: \\( \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Total: \\( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: \\( 49 + 49 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n- More 4's than 8's: \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is okay, but 480-489 is also in the book up to 488. So, let's count how many sets of 100 have 8 in the tens place. Each block contributes 10 numbers. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: but wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the 400s, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8.

So, the first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8,18,...,488. The count is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 is exactly divisible by 10, it's 49 numbers.

Let me think: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, we have 4 full sets (80-89, etc.) each contributing 10, and the last set contributing 9.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers. Let's see how many such blocks are within 488. 80-89: yes, 180-189: yes, 280-289: yes, 380-389: yes. 480-489 would be the next, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of this.

But wait, in the 480-489 block, only up to 488, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, total in tens place: 4 blocks *10=40, plus 9 from the partial block, making it 49 eights? Wait, no, because 480-489 is the fifth block. Wait, 80-89 is first, 180-189 second, 280-289 third, 380-389 fourth, and 480-489 fifth. But since we only go up to 488, the fifth block contributes 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Hmm, that seems high. Wait, let me count again. Each full block (80-89, etc.) is 10 eights in the tens place. There are four such full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389). So that's 4*10=40. Then, the fifth block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), each with 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 more. So, total in tens place: 40+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Wait, but let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so 98 eights. Now, the number of fours was 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the eights. Let me recount the tens place eights. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. Units place: from 8,18,...,488. How many? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place is 49. Tens place is 49, so total eights:98. Fours:188. Difference:188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488.\n   - Each full block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 4 such blocks.

Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so it's actually 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except maybe the last one. Let's see: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers, but 480-489 would be 10. But since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, giving 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with an additional 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (since 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9). Let me count each block: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, but let me check again. Units:49, tens:49. So, 49+49=98. That seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last one is 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? The first is 8, then every 10 after that. So, 8,18,28,...,488. To find how many terms, we can do (488 - 8)/10 + 1. That is (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

Each set from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 has 10 numbers, so that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40.

The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many numbers that is. Each full block (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers, so that's 4 full blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 sets of 10, so 40 eights. Now, the last block is 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 40 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, no, that's not right. Because in the tens place, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 40. Then, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, so how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 more, making it 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but actually, in the tens place, the numbers 480-489 would have 10 eights, but since the book stops at 488, it's only 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, 49 + 49 is 98. So, total eights are 98. Wait, let me confirm. Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 49+49=98. Yes. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with inclusive counts. Let me recount the units and tens places for both digits. For 4's: Units place: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 10n - 6 = 484? Wait, maybe a better way is to calculate (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488. 488 - 400 +1=89 numbers. So, 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct. For 8's: Units place:8,18,...,488. How many? (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, as before. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Each block contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. That seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that is. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many sets do we have? Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 = 40, plus 9 is 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems correct. Let me just double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yes, that seems right. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let's list them: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many sets there are. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 =40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. Units place: 49 eights, tens place:49, so 98 in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, did I do that right? Let me go through again. Fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yes, that seems correct.

I'll do the same for 8's, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The last number with an 8 in the units place is 488. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds another 8. The count would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be next, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except maybe the last one if it's cut short. Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.
