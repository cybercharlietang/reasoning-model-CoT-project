    "text": " Maybe I'm overcounting somewhere. Let me recount each place.\n\nUnits place: For each ten numbers, there's one 4 in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus the last partial ten from 481-488, which includes 484, so that's 49 fours in the units place. That seems right.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). Since we have 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488). Wait, 400-488 is only part of the fifth hundred. So, in 0-99: 10 fours in tens place, 100-199: 10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, and 400-488: how many? From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 10*4 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours.\n\nSo, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is within the book's page count. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 eights, except maybe the last one.\n\nLet me count:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488: how many? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 for all of these. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the tens place eights are 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 40. Then 480-488:9 numbers, so 9 more. So total 49 in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For the tens place, 480-488: the tens digit is 8 for all of these, right? Because 480 is 4 8 0, 481 is 4 8 1, ..., 488 is 4 8 8. So, yes, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers. So, 9 eights in the tens place from 480-488.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but when I counted the units place, I got 49 eights, and the tens place also 49, so total 98 eights.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts.\n\nFirst, fours:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:188.\n\nEights:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for fours. Wait, in the tens place for fours, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. But let me confirm:\n\nFrom 40-49:10\n140-149:10\n240-249:10\n340-349:10\n440-449:10\nThat's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50. That's correct.\n\nFor the eights in the tens place, I had 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but wait a second. When counting the tens place for eights, I included 480-488 as contributing 9 eights in the tens place. But 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, so that's correct.\n\nSo, the total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98.\n\nAnd fours are 188.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I remember sometimes in these digit counting problems, you have to be careful about overlapping or not double-counting, but in this case, I think I'm okay because each digit position is considered separately.\n\nWait, another way to check: maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place: from 4,14,...,484. So, 484 is the 49th occurrence, so 49.\n\nTens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So, 5*10=50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each with 4 in hundreds place.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th occurrence, so 49.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: none, since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, 49+49=98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I thought maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours, but 400-488 is indeed 89 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position.\n\nFor a digit d in a specific position (units, tens, hundreds), the count can be calculated as follows:\n\nLet's take the units place first. For each complete set of 10 numbers, the digit appears once. So, for units place, the number of times 4 appears is floor(488/10) + (1 if the last partial set includes 4 in units place). Wait, more accurately, it's (n // 10) * 1 + min(n % 10, d - (n % 10) + 1) if d <= (n % 10). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to number n is:\n\ncount = (n // 10) * 1 + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nFor units digit, the number of times 4 appears is the number of complete decades (each of 10 numbers) plus whether the last partial decade includes 4 in the units place.\n\nSo, for n=488, the number of complete decades is 48 (since 488//10=48). Then, in the last partial decade (480-488), the units digit goes from 0 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484). So, total units digit 4's: 48 +1=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for tens digit:\n\nThe number of times 4 appears in the tens place is calculated by considering each hundred. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For n=488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399). Each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Now, in the incomplete hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens digit 4's:40+10=50. Correct.\n\nFor hundreds digit:\n\nThe hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. The count is 488 - 400 +1=89. So, 89 fours in hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits digit: same approach. n=488. Complete decades:48, each contributing 1 eight. Then, in the last partial decade (480-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units digit 8's:48 +1=49.\n\nTens digit:\n\nFor each hundred, 10 eights in the tens place. For n=488, complete hundreds are 4 (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399). So, 4*10=40. In the incomplete hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds digit: 800-899, but n=488, so no eights in hundreds place.\n\nSo, total eights:49+49=98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be different. Let me check another way. Maybe I can write a small table for each digit position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position again.\n\nWait, another approach: for each position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n4's: as above, 49.\n\n8's:49.\n\nTens place:\n\n4's:50.\n\n8's:49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's:89.\n\n8's:0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n   **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '8' appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), plus 9 more in the last partial set (480-488). This totals 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '8' does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.\n\n   **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's: 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I'm overcounting? Because when I count the tens place, I included numbers like 444, which has two 4's, but I'm only counting each occurrence once. No, actually, when I count each digit place separately, each occurrence is counted once, regardless of other digits. So, for example, 444 would be counted once in units, once in tens, and once in hundreds, which is correct because it has three 4's. So, 188 seems right. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many full sets we have. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, so fours are 188, eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours and eights.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, step 10. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488. 488-400+1=89. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four is 10, last is 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Because from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. The number of such numbers is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But 48*10 is 480, so the last number with 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 fours, which is correct. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 488 count as a units place 8? Yes, because the units digit is 8. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 also have tens digit 8? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, that's another set: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, so 4 sets * 10 = 40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, but let me check the tens place again. From 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10 +9=49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. So, total eights: 49+49=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check the counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488 is indeed 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Units place: from 4, 14, ..., 484. Let's see, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 49 numbers, which makes sense because 484 is the 49th occurrence. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, etc., each 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49 is in 0-99, 140-149 in 100-199, 240-249 in 200-299, 340-349 in 300-399, 440-449 in 400-499). Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, 5 sets of 10, which is 50. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is included, so 8,18,...,488. Let me confirm: 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 in 480-488, making it 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, no: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for eights. Let me double-check. When counting the tens place for eights, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 49 eights, so total 98 eights. Fours: 188, eights:98, difference is 90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{484}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   Each range contributes 10 occurrences, so:  \n   \\[\n   5 \\times 10 = 50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n   \\]\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 occurrences, and the last range contributes 9.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   0\n   \\]\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference:**  \n\\[\n188 - 98 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Because when I thought about it, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let me calculate it as floor(488/10) + 1 if the remainder is >=4. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. Since 8 >=4, we add 1, so 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct. So units place is 49. Tens place: Each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. There are 5 hundred blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is not a full hundred, but for the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 400-409, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 400-409 is 10 numbers, but 410-419 would have tens digit 1, etc. Wait, no, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 440-449, etc. Wait, no, in each hundred block, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 every 10 numbers. So in 400-499, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But since the book only goes up to 488, 440-449 is within that range, so that's 10 numbers. So for the hundreds place up to 488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. That seems correct. So total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I think I should do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, and the 49th is 488. So that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Similarly, 8 in the tens place occurs in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 is part of it. So how many tens digits are 8? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So total tens digits with 8: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. Wait, is that right? Let me think again. From 0-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So each of the first four sets is 10 numbers, and the last set is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So 4 sets of 10: 40, plus 9, total 49. So 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that seems correct. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. I said that from 400-488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 numbers. Let me check: 488 - 400 +1 = 89. Yes, that's correct. So 89 fours in the hundreds place. Units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, total 98. So 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check the tens place for 8's. When I count 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so in the tens place, the 8's are from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? So 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. So the tens digit is 8 in 9 numbers. So 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) and 1 set of 9, so 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct. So total eights:49+49=98. Yes, that seems right. So the difference is 90. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** \n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 occurrences, and the last block contributes 9 occurrences (since 480-488 is 9 numbers).\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book only goes up to 488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488 is indeed 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. Units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds:89. So, 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. Yeah, that seems right. Now, onto counting the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except maybe the last one. Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so that's 9 eights in the tens place for that block. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Therefore, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to miscount, especially in the tens and hundreds places.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units: 4,14,...,484. That's from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks (40-49 is the first, then each subsequent hundred). So, 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188. That seems right.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) has 9 numbers. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: none, since the book ends at 488.

This is every 10th number, starting at 4 and ending at 484. The count is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49 \\text{ times}\n     \\]\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit from the right):** '4' appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each block contributes 10 instances, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Thus:\n     \\[\n     5 \\times 10 = 50 \\text{ times}\n     \\]\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit from the right):** '4' appears in numbers 400-488. The count is:\n     \\[\n     488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\text{ times}\n     \\]\n   - **Total '4's:** \\(49 + 50 + 89 = 188\\)\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** '8' appears in numbers 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is every 10th number, starting at 8 and ending at 488. The count is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49 \\text{ times}\n     \\]\n   - **Tens Place:** '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.

So, 0 instances.\n   - **Total '8's:** \\(49 + 49 + 0 = 98\\)\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's:\n     \\[\n     188 - 98 = 90\n     \\]\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. When counting units digits, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The formula is to take the number of complete groups of 10, which is floor(488 / 10) = 48, and then add 1 if the units digit is 4 or higher. Since 488 has a units digit of 8, which is higher than 4, so we add 1. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That matches what I had before. Okay, so units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total fours: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor(488/10) = 48. But since 488 ends with 8, which is the 8th digit in the units place, so we add 1. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block. So, how many complete blocks do we have? From 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is included and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, yes, 9 eights in the tens place for the 480-488 block. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights:98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but I thought earlier I had 188 fours and 98 eights, so the difference is 90. Hmm, but let me double-check the counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting, especially in the tens place, I might have missed something. Let me check the tens place for fours again. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 50. That seems correct. For eights in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, totaling 49. That seems right.

So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (including both endpoints), but wait, 480 is the first, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers, right? Wait, no, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9. So, for the tens place, we have 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 eights, and the last partial block 480-488 contributing 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, so 49 in units, 49 in tens, total 98 eights. Now, the number of fours was 188, and eights were 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me recount the fours and eights again. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188. Eights: units:49, tens:49, total 98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. For each digit place, count the number of 4's and 8's and sum them up. Let me try that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use a more systematic approach. For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n- For 4's: Every 10 numbers, there's one 4 in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4, and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488) where 484 has a 4 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 fours in the units place.\n\n- For 8's: Similarly, every 10 numbers, one 8 in the units place. 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, and the last partial set (481-488) includes 488, which is an 8. So, 48 +1=49 eights in the units place.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 4's: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (40-49, 140-149, etc.). How many such blocks are there up to 488? The hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, 5 blocks. Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50 fours. But wait, does the 400-488 block have a full 10 numbers? Wait, 400-409 is the first set in the 400s, but 488 is beyond that. Wait, no, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 440-449, etc. Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. So, each of these is a full 10 numbers, except perhaps the last one if the book ends before. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so it's a full 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place: 5*10=50 fours.\n\n- For 8's: Similarly, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, etc. How many such blocks are there up to 488? The hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, 5 blocks. Each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 5*10=50. But wait, in the last block, 480-489, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, the 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, the first four blocks have 10 eights each, and the last block has 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- For 4's: The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89), so 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\n- For 8's: The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so no eights in the hundreds place. So, zero.\n\nAdding up:\n\nFours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99+89=188.\n\nEights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400 to 488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8 to 488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block (480-488) contributing 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. So, for units place, starting from 4, every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms is that? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 +1 =49. Yeah, that's correct. So, 49 in units, 50 in tens, and 89 in hundreds. So, 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. Okay, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, last is 488. Using the same formula: (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that right? Let me think again. Each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which is incomplete. So, from 0-488, how many hundreds? 488 is in the 400s, so there are five hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Each of the first four hundreds contributes 10 eights in the tens place (80-89, etc.), and the last hundred (400-488) contributes from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 10*4 +9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights are units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, so 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me think again. When counting the tens place for fours, I considered 440-449 as part of the tens place, but actually, in the hundreds place, those are already counted. Wait, no, in the tens place, 440-449 have 4 in both hundreds and tens place, but when we're counting the tens place, we're just counting the tens digit, regardless of the hundreds digit. So, that should be fine. Similarly, in the units place, 444 would have a 4 in units, tens, and hundreds, but each digit is counted separately. So, 444 would contribute to all three counts. So, the total counts are correct. Similarly, for eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, which is correct. So, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98, so the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me recount the units place. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, which would give 48 fours, but then we have an extra 8 numbers (481-488), which includes 484, so that's the 49th four. So, units place is 49, which I think is correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so does that affect the tens place? No, because the tens place in 400-488 would be 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so that's fine. So, 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, which would give 48 eights, but then 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's see how many sets there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189 is 10. 200-299: 280-289 is 10. 300-399: 380-389 is 10. 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 is the last page. So, how many 8's in the tens place? For each of the first four sets (80-89, etc.), there are 10 eights, so 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, that's 9 eights. So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me check again. In the tens place, each hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except for the last hundred, which is only 9 numbers. So, 4 full hundreds (0-399) each contribute 10 eights, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 49 eights. So, total eights: 49 + 49 = 98. Okay, that seems correct. So, number of fours is 188, number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours printed than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the fours in the units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, which gives 48 fours, and then 484 is the 49th four. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets \u00d710=50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. So, 98 eights. Difference: 188-98=90.

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. When counting the units place, I thought 484 is the 49th occurrence, but let me confirm. The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 numbers after that. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms is that? It's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. Yeah, that's correct. So units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total fours:188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. Again, units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,..., up to 488. Wait, 488 ends with 8, so that's included. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers. How many? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many sets of 10 are there? From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. Wait, is that right? Let me count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check again. Did I count correctly? For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. That seems correct. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place for fours. I had 50 fours in the tens place because from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in tens place. And for eights in tens place, I had 49, as the last set was 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's correct. So, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights, so 90 more fours.

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is calculated as follows: The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. The formula is usually floor((n + 10 - d)/10), where d is the digit we're looking for. But maybe an easier way is to calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are, and then see if there's a partial group. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, in each group of 10, the units digit cycles from 0-9, so each group contributes exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 48 complete groups would give 48 fours. Then, in the last partial group, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is another 4 in the units place. So, total units fours would be 48 + 1 = 49. So, that part is correct. Similarly, for the tens place: Each hundred has a block where the tens digit is 4, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes 10 fours. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, how many hundreds are there? Well, 488 is in the 400s, so there are four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, but the tens digit being 4 occurs in each of the first four hundreds, right? So, 40-49 in 1-100, 140-149 in 101-200, 240-249 in 201-300, 340-349 in 301-400, and 440-449 in 401-500, but since we only go up to 488, 440-449 is included, which is 10 numbers. So that's five blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. That seems correct. For the hundreds place, as I thought earlier, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I think a similar approach applies, but let me go through it carefully. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, in the last partial group from 481-488, the units digit goes up to 8, which is 488, so that's another 8. So, total units eights: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the tens digit being 8, but the hundreds digit is 4, so that's included. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 8, contributing 10 eights. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: let's see, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 in 9 of these. So, in the 400s, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens eights: 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, etc.) and one block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? The blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9 eights because it goes from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, no eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Wait, that seems correct. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. So, number of fours is 188, number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed. But wait, did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me double-check the counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. Difference is 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the tens place for fours again. I had 5 blocks: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50. That's correct. For eights in the tens place, I had 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, so 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct too. Units place for both digits: fours had 49, eights had 49. So, yes, the difference is 90. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups + 1 in the last partial group).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (48 full groups + 1 in the last partial group).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 occurrences, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

It's every 10 numbers, so from 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So that's correct. So, 49 in units, 50 in tens, 89 in hundreds: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Okay, that seems right. Now, let me count the number of 8's.

    "text": " Maybe I'm overcounting somewhere. For the units place, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, and then an extra 4 in 484, making it 49. That seems right. For the tens place, each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, so 4 hundreds (1-400, 401-800, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds places are 0,1,2,3,4. Wait, but 400-488 is within the 400-499 range, so that's 90 numbers (from 400 to 489), but since the book ends at 488, it's 89 numbers. Wait, but I was counting the tens place as 10 per hundred, so for 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, right? So, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's 10 fours in the tens place. Similarly, in 1-99, 40-49 is 10; 100-199, 140-149 is 10; 200-299, 240-249 is 10; 300-399, 340-349 is 10; and 400-488, 440-449 is 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. That seems correct. For the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems right.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, plus the 8 in 488. So, 48 +1 = 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets are there? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nWait, is that right? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488. So, that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89: 10 eights in tens place\n180-189: 10\n280-289:10\n380-389:10\n480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page)\nSo, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. That seems correct.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, plus the 8 in 488, making it 49. So, units place:49, correct.\n\nTens place: as above, 49.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nSo total eights:49+49=98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when counting, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nWait, for the tens place of 4's, I had 50 fours. Let me recount that. For the tens digit being 4, the ranges are:\n\n- 40-49:10 numbers\n- 140-149:10\n- 240-249:10\n- 340-349:10\n- 440-449:10\n\nThat's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50. That's correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place, 400-488: 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there.\n\nUnits place:49 fours.\n\nSo total fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nEights:\n\nUnits:49\nTens:49\nHundreds:0\nTotal:98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9.

Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. Fours:188. 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.

I'll do the same approach, looking at units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many 8's in the units place? The first is 8, the next is 18, and so on, up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place: 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place had 49 eights, and tens had 49, so total 98. Hmm, but let me check the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28,..., up to 488. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264488. So, 8 +10(n-1) \u2264488 \u2192 10(n-1) \u2264480 \u2192 n-1 \u226448 \u2192 n \u226449. So, 49 terms. So, units place:49 eights.\n\nTens place: as above, 49 eights.\n\nSo, total eights:49+49=98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place was 49 and tens place was 49, so total 98 eights.\n\nNow, total fours were 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the fours count again. Units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, plus 89=188. That seems correct.\n\nEights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the hundreds place, I might have made a mistake. Let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. That's correct.\n\nFor eights, in the hundreds place, since the book ends at 488, there are no 800s pages, so no eights in the hundreds place. So, eights only in units and tens.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for eights again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nUnits place:49, tens:49, total eights:98.\n\nFours:188.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place for fours. Let me check again. Units place for fours: numbers ending with 4 from 4 to 484. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10 \u2264484. So, 4 +10(n-1) \u2264484 \u219210(n-1) \u2264480 \u2192n-1 \u226448 \u2192n \u226449. So, 49 terms. So, units place:49 fours. Correct.\n\nTens place for fours: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:400-488:89 fours. Correct.\n\nSo, total fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nEights:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred block (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 5 sets of 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred block (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), except the last set which ends at 488, giving 9 numbers. Totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Now, moving on to counting the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but including 488, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. I had 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49. That seems correct. And for the fours, I had 49 in units, 50 in tens, and 89 in hundreds, totaling 188. Yes, that seems right.

Yeah, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full decades, each contributing an 8 in the units place, and then 488 is the 49th occurrence.

Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's calculate: Each full set of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9.

Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, and there are 5 hundreds (1-500, but the book stops at 488). Wait, actually, from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds (1-399), there are 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, so that's 4 sets times 10, which is 40.

But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each hundred (except maybe the last one) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, is that right? Let me recount: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 10*4 + 9 = 49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that seems correct. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for eights. Because in the hundreds place, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so no eights there. But in the tens place, for 480-488, that's 9 numbers, right? 480, 481, ..., 488. So that's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct. So, eights in tens place: 49. Units place:49, so total eights:98. Fours:188. So, 188 - 98 = 90. That seems right. But wait, let me check the units place for eights again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 8,18,28,...,488. The last one is 488. So, how many terms? The sequence is 8,18,...,488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488. So, 10(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. That's correct.

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the tens place. Wait, from 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is 10, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, and 440-449 is 10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. That seems right. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours. Now, let's do the same for 8's. I'll go through each digit place again: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so units digit 8 occurs at 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many terms? From 8 to 488 with a common difference of 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, how many numbers in each set? Each full set (like 80-89) has 10 numbers. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488). So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, that's 49? Wait, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9: 4*10=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Wait, but earlier I thought tens place was 49, units 49, so total 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in the number of terms.\n\nWait, for the tens place in 4's, I had 5 sets each with 10 numbers, which is 50. For 8's, I had 5 sets but the last one was only 9 numbers, so 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I calculated the units place for 4's, I got 49, which is correct because from 4 to 484, that's 484-4=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. Similarly, for 8's, units place is 49, correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 50. For 8's, 5 sets but the last set is only 9 numbers, so 49. So, 50 vs 49, which makes the total 4's higher by 1 in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 89, since 400-488 is 89 numbers. For 8's, hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Total 8's:49+49+0=98. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's in units place were 49, but let me confirm. For units place of 4, starting at 4, every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484-4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nTens place for 8's: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 8's: none, so 0.\n\nSo, adding up: 4's=49+50+89=188. 8's=49+49+0=98. So, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm thinking, is there a quicker way to calculate this without having to manually count each set? Maybe using a formula for each digit place.\n\nFor any digit d in a specific position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times it appears can be calculated by:\n\n- For units place: total numbers // 10 * 1 + min(total numbers % 10, d)\n- For tens place: total numbers // 100 * 10 + min((total numbers % 100) // 10 + 1, d)\n- For hundreds place: total numbers // 1000 * 100 + min((total numbers % 1000) // 100 + 1, d)\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, for each digit position, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider each digit place separately and apply a formula. Let's try that.\n\nFor a given digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a digit d appears in a number from 1 to N can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Let higher = N divided by (current place * 10)\n- Let current = (N / current place) % 10\n- Let lower = N % current place\n- If current > d, count += (higher + 1) * current place\n- If current == d, count += higher * current place + lower + 1\n- If current < d, count += higher * current place\n\nBut since our N is 488, and we're dealing with 1 to 488, perhaps I can apply this formula for each digit position.\n\nLet me try this for 4's and 8's in each digit place.\n\nFirst, let's compute the number of 4's:\n\n1. Units place (place=1):\n   higher = 488 // (1*10) = 48\n   current = (488 // 1) % 10 = 8\n   lower = 488 % 1 = 0\n   Since current (8) > 4:\n   count += (48 + 1) * 1 = 49 *1=49\n\n2. Tens place (place=10):\n   higher = 488 // (10*10)=488//100=4\n   current = (488 //10) %10=48%10=8\n   lower =488%10=8\n   Since current (8) >4:\n   count += (4 +1)*10=5*10=50\n\n3. Hundreds place (place=100):\n   higher =488//1000=0\n   current=(488//100)%10=4%10=4\n   lower=488%100=88\n   Since current=4:\n   count +=0*100 + lower +1=0 +88+1=89\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n1. Units place (place=1):\n   higher=488//10=48\n   current=(488//1)%10=8\n   lower=488%1=0\n   Since current=8 >=8:\n   count += (48)*1 + min(0 +1,1)=48 +1=49\n\nWait, no, let me apply the formula correctly.\n\nWait, for units place, d=8.\n\nhigher=488//10=48\ncurrent= (488//1) %10=8\nlower=488%1=0\n\nSince current=8 >=8, the count is higher*1 + lower +1=48*1 +0 +1=49.\n\n2. Tens place (place=10):\n   higher=488//100=4\n   current=(488//10)%10=48%10=8\n   lower=488%10=8\n   Since current=8 >=8:\n   count += higher*10 + lower +1=4*10 +8 +1=40+8+1=49\n\n3. Hundreds place (place=100):\n   higher=488//1000=0\n   current=(488//100)%10=4%10=4\n   lower=488%100=88\n   Since current=4 <8:\n   count += higher*100=0*100=0\n\nSo total 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nSo, 188 fours and 98 eights, difference is 90.\n\nWait, that's consistent with my earlier count. So, I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes.\n\nYes, for 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Numbers ending with 4 occur every 10 pages: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{484}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Numbers with 4 in the tens place occur in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - There are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, so \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Numbers from 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Numbers ending with 8 occur every 10 pages: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Numbers with 8 in the tens place occur in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - There are 5 such ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488).\n   - The last range (480-488) contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No numbers in 1-488 have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:** \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. When I considered the units place, I thought from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The formula is (number of complete groups of 10) plus any extra. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, plus one more for the 484. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct. For the tens place, from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. That seems right. For the hundreds place, numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, each block except the last one has 10 numbers. Let's count: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counting for the tens place in the eights. For the tens place, I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). That's 4*10 +9 =49. That seems correct. And for the units place, it's 49. So, total eights: 98. And fours were 188. So, 188 - 98 =90. Yeah, that seems right.

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488 is indeed 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. Yeah, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last).

    "text": " When I count the units place, I thought it was 49, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me recount. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first 4 is at 4, then 14, 24, ..., up to 484. To find how many terms there are, it's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So yes, 49 fours in the units place. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but from 400-488, the tens digit can be 4, but only up to 488. So, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place. Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours.

Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it's the last page. So, how many such numbers? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49.

So, let's count how many sets there are. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). 101-200: 180-189 (10). 201-300: 280-289 (10). 301-400: 380-389 (10). 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, that's 49+49=98 eights. But let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10 +9=49. So yes, 49 in the tens place. Units place:49, so total eights:98.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier that the units place was 49, but let me check again. From 8,18,...,488. How many terms? The first term is 8, last is 488. The difference is 480, divided by 10 gives 48, plus 1 is 49. So yes, 49 units place eights. So total eights:49+49=98.\n\nWait, but I thought the hundreds place has 0, so total eights are 98.\n\nNow, the problem is to find how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the counts again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units:49\n\n- Tens:50\n\n- Hundreds:89\n\nTotal:49+50=99, +89=188.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units:49\n\n- Tens:49\n\n- Hundreds:0\n\nTotal:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct.

So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.

    "text": " Maybe I'm overcounting somewhere. Let me recount the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. That seems correct. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So 49 +50 +89 =188 fours. Okay, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is included, right? So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count each set. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers, but in the tens place, each number from 480-489 would have an 8 in the tens place, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =98 eights. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. When I counted the tens place for 8's, I considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, and the last set has 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That seems correct. Similarly, for fours, in the tens place, we had 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hmm. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights. I think that's correct. Wait, but let me double-check the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Units place for fours:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188. For eights, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, total 98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488 \u2192 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. Now, moving on to the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. If I divide 488 by 10, I get 48.8, so 48 full sets, which gives 48 eights. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place, except the last block, which only has 9. Let me count: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. But wait, let me check the tens place for fours again. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct. For eights, tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10\u00d74=40, plus 9 is 49. Correct. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is indeed 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Let me recount the units place. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place would be the number of complete decades plus any extra. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, which is 48. But wait, in the 48th decade, which is 480-489, but our book stops at 488, so in the units place, 484 is the last 4. So, that's 49 times because from 0-488, the units digit cycles 49 times? Wait, no, 488 is the last page, so the units digit goes up to 8 in the last page. So, 488 is the 48th set of 10 numbers (480-489), but since we only go up to 488, the units digit in 480-488 would have 484 as the last 4 in the units place. So, how many 4's in the units place? Let's think: starting at 4, every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 fours in the units place. That seems correct. So, total fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I think I should do the same approach, counting in units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does that count as an 8 in the units place? Yes, because 488 ends with an 8. So, the number of 8's in the units place is 49, because starting from 8, every 10 numbers up to 488. Let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. Each hundred block (except maybe the last one) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 +9=49. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, 480-489 would be 10, but we only go up to 488, so 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=188-98=90. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me check the tens place for fours again. I had 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's five sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50. Correct. And hundreds place for fours is from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49. Correct. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for eights. Let me recount that. For tens digit 8: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, which is 49. Correct. So, yes, the difference is 90.

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the tens place. For the tens place, from 40-49 is 10 numbers, then each subsequent hundred has another 10, but up to 400-488. So, how many hundreds blocks are there? The first block is 1-100, then 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-500. But our book stops at 488, so in the 401-500 block, it's only up to 488. But for the tens digit, in each hundred block, the 4 in the tens place occurs in 10 numbers, except maybe the last block. Wait, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, right? So, 10 in each hundred block where the tens digit is 4, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 5*10=50. That seems correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488, so the units digit 8 occurs at 488. How many times? The first occurrence is 8, the next is 18, and so on. The number of such numbers is floor(488/10) = 48, but wait, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so 48 full tens and then 8. So, 49 numbers, right? Because from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place, so 488/10 = 48.8, which would be 49 times. Wait, but let me list a few: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, how many full blocks are there? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm. From 80-89: 10 eights in the tens place. Similarly for 180-189, etc., each adds 10. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (480,481,...,488). So, 9 eights in the tens place. So total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours and eights. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me think again about the units place for fours. When counting units place fours, I considered 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms is that? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, last is 484, first is 4, step is 10. So, (484-4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. For tens place fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. Correct. So, fours:188. For eights: units place:8,18,28,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, eights:98. Therefore, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting the hundreds place, I might have missed something. Let me check the hundreds place for fours: from 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488-400+1=89. Correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, yes, 188 fours in total. And for eights, 98 in total. So, 188-98=90.

So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Hmm, wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my counts again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct. But wait, did I count correctly in the tens place for fours? Let me recount the fours in the tens place. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. So, that's correct. And for the units place, 488/10=48.8, so 49. So, 49 in units, 50 in tens, 89 in hundreds: 188. For eights, units:49, tens:49, so 98. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for fours would be 89, but let me check: 400 to 488 inclusive. 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, that's correct. So, yeah, 188 fours and 98 eights, difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the units place for fours. Let's see: The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first 4 is at 4, then 14,24,...,484. So, 484 is the last one. Now, how many terms are there in this sequence? It's an arithmetic sequence starting at 4, ending at 484, with a common difference of 10. The formula for the nth term is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d. So, 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 484-4=480=(n-1)*10. So, n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in the units place. That's correct. Similarly, for eights in the units place: 8,18,28,...,488. 488 is included. So, using the same formula: a_n=8 + (n-1)*10=488. So, 488-8=480=(n-1)*10, so n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. So, that's correct. Now, for the tens place, fours: as before, 50. Eights in the tens place: 49, because the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, that's correct. So, total fours:188, eights:98. So, difference is 90. Hmm, I think that's correct. Maybe I was overcomplicating it, but I think the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, yes, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 484 / 10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: Each hundred has 10, so 4 sets (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349) would be 40, but wait, 440-449 is the fifth set, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems right. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many. The last number is 488, so 488 /10 = 48.8, so 49 numbers? Wait, 488 is included, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers except the last one. Let's see: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total eights in the tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, so 49 +49 is 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to miscount, especially in the tens and units places.\n\nWait, when counting the units place for 8's, I said 49, but let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. So, 8 +10(n-1) \u2264488 \u219210(n-1) \u2264480 \u2192n-1 \u226448 \u2192n \u226449. So, 49 terms, correct.\n\nFor the tens place, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49, correct.\n\nSo, total eights:49+49=98.\n\nFor fours, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about the tens place for fours, I considered up to 440-449, which is within 488. So, 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449: that's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. That seems correct.\n\nAnd hundreds place for fours:400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours.\n\nUnits place for fours:49, as above.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188 fours.\n\nEights:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488 is indeed 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yeah, that seems right. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 is the last page. So, starting at 8, the next is 18, 28, ..., 488. How many numbers is that? Let's see, the first occurrence is 8, which is 8/10 = 0.8, so the first number is 8. The last occurrence is 488, which is 488/10 = 48.8, so the last number is 488. So, the number of 8's in the units place is 49, same as the 4's in the units place. Wait, is that correct? Because 488 is included, so 8,18,...,488. So, how many terms? The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. Let's solve for when the term is 488: 8 + 10(n-1) = 488 \u2192 10(n-1) = 480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, did I count correctly? Let me double-check the counts for 4's and 8's. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct. So, 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488, so how many 8's in the units place? Starting from 8, each 10 numbers add one. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8,18,...,488. The first is 8 (1), then 18 (2), ..., 488 is the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set. Each set of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 =9). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 480 is the first, then 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers. So, the tens place has 10 +10+10+10+9=49 eights. Wait, that seems off. Let me recount. From 80-89:10 eights in the tens place. 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but wait a second. When I counted the units place, I included 488, which has an 8 in both units and tens place. So, in the units place, 488 is counted once, and in the tens place, it's also counted once. That's correct because each digit is considered separately. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units place 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for fours. Let me check that again. For fours in the tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. That seems correct. And in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours 188.

The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but including 488, that's 49 numbers.

    "text": " Maybe I should think of it another way. For the units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, which gives 48 fours, but then in the last partial cycle, from 481 to 488, the units digit is 4 at 484, so that's one more, making it 49. Yeah, that seems right. For the tens place, as I thought earlier, it's 50 fours. And the hundreds place is 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, moving on to counting the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, which gives 48 eights, plus the last number 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the last set. Each full set (e.g., 80-89) has 10 eights in the tens place. So, how many full sets are there? From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: how many? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), but only the tens digit is 8 in all of these, so that's 9 eights. Wait, no: 480-488 has 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40, plus the 480-488 set contributing 9 eights. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counting for eights in the tens place. I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, so 9 eights. But 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). Each of these has 8 in the tens place, so that's correct. So, 4 full sets (80-89, etc.) give 40, plus 9, total 49. That seems right. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, total 98 eights. And fours were 188. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Yeah, that seems correct. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, from 4, 14, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, giving 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, from 8, 18, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., plus 480-488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number. 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Let me recount the units place. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours. But then, in the 480-488 range, the units digit 4 occurs at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 fours. Tens place: as I thought, 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 eights in the units place. Let me check: 8,18,...,488. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the book since it goes up to 488. So, each of these ranges contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except maybe the last one. Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, right? So, 480-488: 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. Hundreds place for fours: from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. And in the tens place for fours: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of those is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers. So, 188 fours. For eights: units place, 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. So, 98 eights in total. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488 is indeed 89 numbers, so that's correct. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let me see how many that is. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last block which goes only up to 488. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my counting again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. So, 188 - 98 is indeed 90. Hmm, but I'm not sure if I counted correctly in the tens place for eights. Let me recount the tens place for eights. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. So, the difference is 90 fours more than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because in the hundreds place for fours, from 400-488 is 89 numbers, but in the hundreds place for eights, there are none. So, maybe that's why the difference is so large. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me see: 400 is page 400, and the last page is 488, so 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. That's correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete groups of 10, plus any extra. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, that's 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, and then in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total units place fours: 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct. For the tens place, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 1-488, there are 4 hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but since the book stops at 488, the tens digit 4 in the hundreds place would be from 400-488. So, in the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 fours, so 4 hundreds would be 4*10=40. But wait, 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit 4 in 400-488 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's one more 10. So, total tens place fours: 5*10=50. That seems correct. For the hundreds place, as I thought earlier, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing an 8, and then in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit 8 appears at 488. So, total units place eights: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is within the book's range. So, each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place. From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189: 10. 200-299: 280-289: 10. 300-399: 380-389: 10. 400-488: 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the tens place, each of the first four hundreds contributes 10 eights, and the last hundred contributes 9 eights. So total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me think again about the tens place for eights. From 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is the first, then 481, ..., up to 488. So that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct. So, the total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. So, the difference is indeed 188 - 98 = 90.

Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through each digit position again. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 count? Yes, because the last page is 488. So, how many terms? The first term is 8, then 18, up to 488. So, the sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. Let me find how many terms. The nth term is 8 + 10*(n-1).

So, how many sets? Each hundred block (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book stops at 488, it's only 9 numbers (480-488). So, that's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but wait, did I count correctly? Let me check again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. So, units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full tens, so 48 fours, but then we have an extra 4 in 484, making it 49. Yeah, that's correct. So, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188 fours. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is valid. So, how many sets? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 10 +10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 =8, so 9 numbers including both ends. So, 49 in tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Therefore, the number of fours is 188, and eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for eights. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. For fours, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is correct. Units and tens places also seem correct. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since 484 is the 49th occurrence).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since 488 is the 49th occurrence).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488), which has 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = **49**.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is indeed 89 numbers. So, 89 fours there. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yeah, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 5 blocks, but the last block only has 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, so 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. When I have 480-488, that's 9 numbers, right? Because 488-480+1=9. So, yes, that's correct. So, 4 blocks of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and one block of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That's correct. And for fours, in the units place, 484 is the last one, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 units, 50 tens, 89 hundreds. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.
