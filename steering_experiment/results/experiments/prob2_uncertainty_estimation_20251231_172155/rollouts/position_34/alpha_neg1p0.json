I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 8, 18, ..., 488: that's 49 numbers because from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 is also a set, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such blocks exist up to 488. From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189:10. 200-299: 280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, adding up: 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check that again. From 0-99: 80-89:10. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.

The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? Let's divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48, but adding 1 because we include both endpoints. Wait, actually, it's better to calculate it as (488 - 8)/10 + 1. So, (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each of these blocks except the last one has 10 numbers. Let's count them: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. Yes, 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours -98 eights =90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

The last number is 488, which is the 8 in the units place. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds another 8. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for eights. When I was counting the tens place for eights, I considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, 49 in tens place. Units place: from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers, so 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units:49, tens:49, total eights:98. Fours:188. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last which contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many 8's are in the units place? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10 each time. To find how many terms, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place. Specifically, for 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). So, 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, that's correct. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488), totaling 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, the total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90.

Let me go through the same process, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many that is. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488.

Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, each of the next three sets (180-189, etc.) is 10 each, so 3*10=30, plus 80-89=10, so 40, and then 480-488 is 9, so total 49.

    "text": " Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 is included. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the 49th number? Let me check: 8, 18, ..., 488. Each 10 numbers contribute one 8 in the units place. From 1-488, how many 8's in units place? It's the same as the number of times 8 appears in the units place up to 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, and then the 49th in 488. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, let's count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 49 is 98, yes. But let me check again. Units: 49, Tens:49, so total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: Units:49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems right. For eights: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. For eights, in the tens place, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Units place:8,18,...,488:49 numbers. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I just thought of something. When counting the units place for fours, I went up to 484, which is 484, and 484 is the 49th occurrence. Similarly, for eights, 488 is included, so that's correct. Also, in the tens place for fours, I considered up to 440-449, which is correct because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? Let's see, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's see how many complete blocks we have. From 1-400: There are 4 blocks of 100 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488: The tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yep, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: Units place: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For eights: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yep, that seems right.

Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but we have to include 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, 8 appears in the units place 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets do we have?

Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but the book ends at 488, so we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last block which only has 9. So, let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, which is 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, let me check again. Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98. That seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right.

    "text": " 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99, plus 89 (hundreds) = 188. That seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number is 488, so how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. Yes, 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, is that right? Let me check: 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 contributes 9 eights in the tens place. So total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because 188 - 98 is 90, but I might have made a mistake in counting. Let me go through the eights again. Units place: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is floor(488/10) + 1 if 488 is included. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but since 488 is the 49th term, units place has 49 eights. Tens place: as above, 40 +9=49. So, 49+49=98. Fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to make an off-by-one error. Let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct because 488 - 400 +1 = 89. For the tens place in fours: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, and there are 5 such sets (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449). So, 5*10=50. Units place for fours: every 10 numbers, from 4,14,...,484. 484 is the last one, which is 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units place is 49, tens place is 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None (since pages go up to 488) \u2192 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Let's count how many. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Yes, because 8 appears in 8,18,...,488. So that's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks we have. The book goes up to 488, so the last block is 380-389. So that's 4 blocks (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389), each contributing 10 eights. So that's 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but does 480-488 have any 8 in the tens place? Yes, 480-488 has 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So that's another 9 eights in the tens place, right? Wait, no, because 480-488 is part of the hundreds digit being 4, but the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), each with 8 in the tens place.

Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the units place for fours, I considered up to 484, which is 484, so that's 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Similarly, for eights, up to 488, which is 488/10 = 48.8, so 49 numbers. That seems right. For the tens place in fours, we had 5 sets of 10: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. For eights in the tens place, we had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That adds up. Hundreds place for fours is from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4. So, 89 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Eights: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This is 89 occurrences (488 - 400 + 1).\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences (488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8. So, there are 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is in the units place as 8. So, units place has 49 eights. Wait, let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many sets. Each full hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last, but 489 isn't included). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. Wait, let me make sure: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. Yes, that's 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be another set, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Each full hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many full hundreds we have before 480. From 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each has 10 numbers with tens digit 8, so that's 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me check again: units 49, tens 49, so 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.

Because from 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me check again. Units place: 49, tens:49, so total 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me double-check the counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of 8s in units place is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 480-488.

So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yep, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Let's count how many. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but let me check: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, how many? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last, but 489 isn't in the book). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me verify: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. That seems correct. I don't think I missed any cases. For example, in the hundreds place for fours, it's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. For eights, hundreds place is zero. In the tens place, for fours, it's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. For eights, it's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. Units place both have 49 occurrences. So, yes, 188-98=90.

That seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1. That's (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would be the next set, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488-480+1=9). Wait, no, wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers, but each of these has an 8 in the tens place. So, 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

    "text": " Units: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Okay, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many numbers is that? Let me see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, how many numbers in each set? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 =40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188-98 is 90. Hmm, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, when counting the units place for 4's, I thought it was 49, but let me confirm. From 4 to 484, every 10 numbers, so 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: 40-49, 140-149, etc. Up to 440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449). So, 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188. That seems right.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 +10*(n-1)=488. So, 10*(n-1)=480, n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 eights in units place.\n\nTens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, and the last block has 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place.\n\nHundreds place: none, as the book doesn't go beyond 488. So, 0.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when counting the hundreds place, I might have missed something. For example, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. And for 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, correct.\n\nYes, I think that's accurate. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. If I divide 488 by 10, I get 48.8, so 48 full tens, meaning 48 eights? Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's 8 in the units place. Wait, let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of such numbers is floor(488 / 10) = 48. But since 488 is included, which is 8 in the units place, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because 480, 481, ..., 488: that's 9 numbers. Let me count how many sets of 10 there are where the tens digit is 8. Each full set is 10 numbers, so 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 full sets (each contributing 10 eights in the tens place) and one partial set with 9 eights. So, 4*10 = 40, plus 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units place 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that's correct.

Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 480 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). So, that's 9 numbers instead of 10. So, for the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, 8, 18, ..., 488.

So, total eights in tens place: 10 +10+10+10+9=49. Wait, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, which is 49.

Now for eights: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the tens place for fours. Let me check that again. For fours in the tens place, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. Similarly, for eights, in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49.

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 is included, so how many such numbers are there? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many full sets we have. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). So, 10*4 +9=49. Yep, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many. The last number is 488, which is the units digit. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but including 488, that's 49 occurrences.

Wait, but 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, except maybe the last one if it's cut short. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page).

Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, and we take the integer part plus one).\n   - Total: 49 fours.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - This range includes 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - Total: 89 fours.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = **188 fours**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, and we take the integer part plus one).\n   - Total: 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 eights.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = **98 eights**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 fours - 98 eights = **90 more fours than eights**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Units place: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems right. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. Again, we'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers. The first occurrence is at 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, 488 is included, so 8 appears in the units place 49 times? Wait, 8,18,...,488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. Let me solve for when 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. Let's see, 488 - 8 = 480, so 480 /10 = 48, so n-1 =48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, except the last one, which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, giving 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488 (9 numbers). Totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
