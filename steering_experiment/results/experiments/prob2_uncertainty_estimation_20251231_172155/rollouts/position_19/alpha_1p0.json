    "text": " Let me confirm: The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) in 488. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, plus one more in the incomplete decade (484). So, that's 49 times. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each 10 numbers, the units digit is 4 exactly once. So, how many 10s are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades and 8 extra numbers. So, in each full decade, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 484 is included, which adds one more. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This occurs in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many ranges? Let's see: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This occurs in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, let's add up all the 4's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. Total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many? Let's see: The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 is included. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, and then the last 8 in 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This occurs in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is the range for the hundreds digit 4 and tens digit 8. So, how many ranges? 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. The last range has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, the first four ranges contribute 4*10=40, and the last range contributes 9. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can't be 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, let's add up all the 8's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 49, Hundreds place: 0. Total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 49, Hundreds place: 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 8's. Let me recount that. The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, 40+9=49. That seems correct. Similarly, for 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Units place for 4's: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds:89. So, 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, yes, 188 4's and 98 8's. Therefore, the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (every 10 numbers, including 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (pages 400-488).\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (every 10 numbers, including 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences (no page numbers start with 8).\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I think I made a mistake earlier. The correct count should be 49. Let me confirm: the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) in 488. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, plus one more in the incomplete decade (484). So, total 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. Let's count how many such sets there are. Each set has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then, 140-149: another 10, and so on. How many such sets are there? The hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, but when the hundreds digit is 0, it's just 40-49, which is 10 numbers. For hundreds digit 1, it's 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, the last set is 440-449, which is within 488, so it's valid. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, plus one more in the incomplete decade (488). So, 48 +1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see: from 80-89: 10 numbers. Then, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, does 480-489 count? Well, 488 is the last page, so 480-488 includes 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). But in the tens place, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but earlier I thought each set was 10 numbers, but here, the last set is only 9. So, how does that affect the count? Let me think: Normally, each set (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers, but the last set (480-488) only has 9. So, how many sets are there? The hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, 5 sets. But the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 numbers, contributing 10 each. The fifth set is 480-488, which has 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets x10 +1 set x9=40+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place count: 0. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 =90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4, 14, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should calculate it differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But then, from 481 to 488, the units digit cycles from 1 to 8, so 484 is included in the 48th group. So, actually, it's 48 times in the units place, right? Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within that. So, 48 times. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as floor(488/10) = 48. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers long. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers) From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers) From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers) From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers) Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 numbers. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, total 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 48 times. Tens place: 50 times. Hundreds place: 89 times. So, 48+50=98, plus 89 is 187. Hmm, okay. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? The last page is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing an 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 times. Wait, let's check: 8, 18, ..., 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these is 10 numbers. Let's count how many such ranges are within 488. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers) From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers) From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers) Now, 400-488: does 480-489 fall within 488? 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, only 480-488 are included, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but the tens digit is 8, so 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, in the hundreds place, 480-488 contributes 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, the ranges are: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 40 times. Wait, let me recount. From 0-99: 80-89: 10. 100-199: 180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9. So, total 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me verify the count of 4's again. Units place: 48 times. Tens place: 50 times. Hundreds place: 89 times. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For 8's: Units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought 4's in the tens place might be 50, but let me check that again. For 4's in the tens place, the ranges are 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. And in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. For 8's, units place:49, tens place:49. So, 98 total. So, 187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89. Wait, but I'm wondering if I counted correctly in the units place for 4's and 8's. Let me think again. For 4's in units place: from 4,14,...,484. So, how many terms? The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) +1. (488-4)=484, 484/10=48.4, floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, this is conflicting. So, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify. The number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated as follows: For digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor((n - d)/10) +1, provided d <=n. So, for 4's in units place: floor((488 -4)/10)+1= floor(484/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. So, which is correct? Let's take a smaller example. From 1 to 20, how many 4's in units place? 4,14: that's 2 times. Using the formula: floor((20-4)/10)+1= floor(16/10)+1=1+1=2. Correct. So, applying to 488: floor((488-4)/10)+1= floor(484/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. So, I was wrong earlier; it's 49, not 48. So, I need to correct that. So, for 4's: units place:49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. Total 4's:49+50+89=188. Wait, 49+50=99, plus 89=188. Hmm, so I was wrong earlier; it's 188, not 187. Similarly, for 8's: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. So, difference is 188-98=90. Wait, so now I'm getting 90. But let me check again because I think I made a mistake in the initial count. Let me recount 4's in units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. So, 49+50=99, plus 89=188. 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the correct answer should be 90. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 89. So, where did I go wrong? Let me go back. When I first calculated 4's in units place, I thought it was 48, but using the formula, it's 49. So, that's the mistake. So, 4's:49+50+89=188. 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the correct answer is 90. But let me make sure about the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, how many numbers? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. So, 89 times. So, 4's:49+50+89=188. 8's:49+49=98. So, difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488 - 4}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{484}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears from page 400 to 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n\\[ 49 \\ (\\text{units}) + 50 \\ (\\text{tens}) + 89 \\ (\\text{hundreds}) = 188 \\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488 - 8}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{480}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, except the last one (480-488), which contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 0 \\).\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n\\[ 49 \\ (\\text{units}) + 49 \\ (\\text{tens}) + 0 \\ (\\text{hundreds}) = 98 \\]\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**\n\\[ 188 - 98 = 90 \\]\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\(\\boxed{90}\\)."

For the units place, in every block of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the units place, from 480 to 488, the 4 in the units place occurs at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, actually, there are 49 times when 4 appears in the units place. Hmm, I think that's correct. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 pages. Then, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 blocks, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400 to 488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up the counts for each place: Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. Total number of 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's count the blocks: 80-89 is one block, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times. Wait, but does 380-389 go up to 488? Yes, because 389 is less than 488. So, 4 blocks, 40 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the block 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the counts for each place: Units: 49, Tens: 40, Hundreds: 0. Total number of 8's = 49 + 40 + 0 = 89. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 99. So, there are 99 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. For the 8's: Units: 49, Tens: 40, so 89. 188 - 89 = 99. Yeah, that seems correct. I think I did it right.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. There are 40 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 40 + 0 = 89.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 89 (8's) = 99.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{99}."

    "text": " Maybe I should think of it as (488 // 10) + 1 if the remainder is greater than or equal to 4. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. Since 8 is greater than 4, does that mean there's an extra 4 in the units place? Hmm, actually, no. Because the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so up to 480, there are 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again. So, total 4's in the units place are 48. Wait, but when I count from 4 to 484, that's 49 numbers, right? Because 484 is the 49th number. So maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me clarify: The number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated by (N // 10) + 1 if the digit is less than the units digit of N. Wait, no, perhaps a better formula is: For a digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place up to N is (N // 10) + (1 if N % 10 >= d else 0). So, for d=4 and N=488: 488 // 10 = 48, and 488 % 10 = 8, which is >=4, so we add 1. So total 4's in units place: 48 +1=49. Wait, but that can't be right because 488 is the last page, and the units digit goes up to 8. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see: 4,14,24,...,484. That's every 10 numbers, starting at 4. So the number of such numbers is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So yes, 49 times. Okay, so units place for 4's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. So how many such blocks are there? From 1-99: 40-49: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149:10. From 200-299:240-249:10. From 300-399:340-349:10. From 400-488:440-449:10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So total 5*10=50. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, but 440-449 is included, so that's fine. So total 50 times. Wait, but let me check: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. Yes, that's 5 blocks, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89 numbers. So in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. So total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +50 +89= 188. Wait, let me add that again: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So 188 4's. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, does 488 count as an extra? 488 is the last page, so yes, the units digit is 8, so that's an extra one. So total units place 8's: 48 +1=49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is within the book's pages. So let's count how many such blocks: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, because 488-480+1=9). Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one block of 9. So total 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So yes, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4, but not 8. So the hundreds place never has an 8. So total number of 8's is units + tens:49 +49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 times.\n- Total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. This totals 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in any page number up to 488.\n- Total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me think: from 1 to 488, how many numbers have a 4 in the units place. The first is 4, then every 10 after that. So the count would be floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1. Let's compute that: (488 - 4) is 484, divided by 10 is 48.4, floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, 449 is less than 488. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place, which is the third digit. That would be from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me compute that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds place again. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same method as before: floor((488 - 8)/10) + 1. (488 - 8) is 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place, such as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. Let me count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9). So total in the tens place is 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: From 1-99: 80-89 is 10. From 100-199: 180-189 is 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is 10. From 400-488: 480-488 is 9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

    "text": " I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is 48 full groups (480 pages), plus one more for the 484. So, 48 * 1 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, no, actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But then, in the 480-488 range, the units digit goes from 0 to 8, so 484 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. So, I think it's 49 times. Hmm, maybe I should use a formula. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is given by floor(n/10) + 1 if the units digit is >= d, else floor(n/10). Wait, no, actually, it's floor((n + 1)/10) if d is in the units place. Let me check with a smaller number. For example, from 1 to 24, how many 4's in the units place? 4,14,24. That's 3 times. Using the formula: floor((24 +1)/10) = floor(25/10) = 2, which is not correct. Hmm, maybe my formula is wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's better to calculate it as follows: For each position, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated by considering the higher digits and the lower digits. But perhaps for simplicity, since we're dealing with 488, which is not too large, I can break it down by each digit position.\n\nLet me try again for the units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? Every 10 numbers, starting at 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, the first such number is 4, and the last is 484. The total count is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place: The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, which is correct. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nFor the hundreds place: The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nUnits place: How many times does 8 appear in the units place from 1 to 488? Every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. The first is 8, last is 488. So, the count is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times.\n\nTens place: The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So, each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers except possibly the last one. Let's see:\n\nFrom 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers).\n\nFrom 100-199: 180-189 (10).\n\nFrom 200-299: 280-289 (10).\n\nFrom 300-399: 380-389 (10).\n\nFrom 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, for the 480-488 range, it's 9 numbers, not 10. So, total in tens place: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one range of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is the tens digit 8, right? Because 480 is 4 8 0, so yes, the tens digit is 8. So, from 480 to 489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's:4*10 +9=49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's:0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds =49 +49 +0=98.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. The difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the 4's and 8's.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** 4,14,24,...,484 \u2192 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488 \u2192 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** None, as the book ends at 488 \u2192 0 times.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 times more than the digit '8'.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should calculate it differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last group is 480-488. In this group, the units digits go from 0 to 8, so 484 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as (488 + 1) // 10, which is 48.9, so 48 times, but actually, since 484 is within 488, it's 48 times. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so the units digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's the number of times 4 is the units digit. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? Let's see: The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This occurs in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449. Let me count how many full sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 instances of 4 in the tens place. How many such sets are there? From 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 instances, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fit within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 instances. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is included, so the last occurrence is 488. How many terms? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. Common difference is 10. Number of terms: ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Each set contributes 10 numbers, except possibly the last one. Let's count them: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, the first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9. So total in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 instances in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me verify: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, but since we include both endpoints, it's 49 numbers. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1 to 488, we have the blocks 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, so how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8*49=488. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. How many such blocks are there? From 1 to 488, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 4 * 10 = 40 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never is 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's are printed, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 89 = 99.

Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440 is included, so yes, 5 blocks.

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should calculate it as (488 // 10) + 1 if 488 ends with 4? Hmm, no, 488 ends with 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is 48*10 + 4. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 numbers ending with 4, and then 484 is the 49th. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are within 1 to 488. The first is 40-49, that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10. Then 240-249, 10. Then 340-349, 10. Then 440-449, which is another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). But wait, in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. So, let's count each range:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nSo, total in the tens place: 4 ranges with 10 each, and one range with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check the tens place for 8's. For the range 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, yes, 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49 (10),140-149(10),240-249(10),340-349(10),440-449(10). That's 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89 (10),180-189(10),280-289(10),380-389(10),480-488(9). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot, but maybe it's correct. Let me think about another approach. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position again.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each digit position separately.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor((488 + 1)/10) = 49 (since 488//10=48, plus 1 if the remainder is >=4, which it is, so 49).\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in units: same calculation, 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 8's in units are 49, but 488 is included, so yes, 49.\n\nWait, but when I calculated 4's in units as 49, that's correct.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's in tens place: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). How many hundreds are there up to 488? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, 5 hundreds. But in the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so the range 440-449 is fully included, but 480-488 is only part of the tens digit 8. Wait, no, for the tens digit, in 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8, so for the tens digit being 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: Similarly, in each hundred, the tens digit 8 occurs in 80-89, which is 10 numbers. But in the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many hundreds? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, 5 hundreds. In the first four, each has 10 numbers with tens digit 8, and the last has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nFor hundreds digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: In 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers. So, 89.\n\nNumber of 8's: None, since the book ends at 488, so hundreds digit 8 would start at 800, which is beyond 488.

    "text": " Maybe I should calculate it as (488 // 10) + 1 if the last number is included. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, and then we check if the units digit is 4 in 488, which it's not. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48. Wait, no, because from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, but since 488 ends with 8, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500, but since we only go up to 488, the last block is 401-488). Wait, let me count the hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, that's 5 blocks, but the last one isn't a full hundred. Now, in each full hundred block (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the last block, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 in the tens place, but here it's 401-409, 410-419, etc., but wait, 401-488: the tens digit is 4 for 401-409 (tens digit 0), 410-419 (tens digit 1), ..., up to 480-488 (tens digit 8). Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. The tens digit is the second digit from the right. So, in 401-488, the tens digit can be 0,1,2,...,8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 401-409? No, wait, 401-409: the tens digit is 0. Wait, no, 401 is 4 0 1, so the tens digit is 0. So, when does the tens digit become 4 in 401-488? It's in 440-449. So, that's 10 numbers: 440-449. So, in the last block, we have another 10 occurrences. So total tens place 4's: 4 blocks \u00d710 +10=50. Wait, but wait, 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for page numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full times, but since 488 ends with 8, it's the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. Each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks? From 1-488, the hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488. So, in each of the first four blocks, there's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 4\u00d710=40. In the last block, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9. So, total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is never 8. So, hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the difference is number of 4's minus number of 8's: 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 50 occurrences (40 in the first four hundreds and 10 in 440-449).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences (including 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. There are 49 occurrences (40 in the first four hundreds and 9 in 480-488).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number since the book ends at 488. So, 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place up to N can be calculated as (N // 10) + 1 if the units digit is >= the target digit. Hmm, maybe I should use a formula instead of manually counting. Let me think. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor(N/10) + (1 if the units digit of N is >= d else 0). So for d=4, N=488. So floor(488/10)=48. The units digit of 488 is 8, which is greater than 4, so we add 1. So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So in 1-99, there's one block (40-49). In 100-199, another block (140-149). Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 300-399: 340-349, and 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does the last block (440-449) go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers are included. So total 4's in tens place: 5*10=50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But we're only interested in the hundreds digit, which is 4 for all these numbers. So each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So total 4's in hundreds place: 89. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll go through each digit position similarly. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? Using the same formula as before. N=488, d=8. floor(488/10)=48. The units digit of 488 is 8, which is equal to d, so add 1. So total 8's in units place: 48 +1=49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So how many full blocks are there? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but let me check using the formula. The number of times 8 appears in the tens place is calculated as follows: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So in 1-99, 80-89: 10 numbers. Similarly, 100-199:180-189:10, 200-299:280-289:10, 300-399:380-389:10, and 400-488:480-488:9 numbers. So total 4*10 +9=49. So total 8's in tens place:49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So total 8's in hundreds place:0. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=49+49=98. So total 8's:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's:188-98=90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that makes sense. Let me just verify the tens place for 4's again. I had 5 blocks: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. For 8's in the tens place, I had 4 full blocks (each 10 numbers) and one partial block of 9 numbers, totaling 49. That also seems correct. So yes, I think 90 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Using the formula: floor(488/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488.\n   - There are 89 numbers (400-488 inclusive).\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Using the formula: floor(488/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks have 10 numbers each, and the last block has 9 numbers.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should think of it as (488 // 10) + 1. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 484 is the last one, that's 48 + 1 = 49? Hmm, maybe I should calculate it as (last occurrence - first occurrence)/step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449. Let me count how many full sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, and each set contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such sets are there? The first set is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5 sets * 10 = 50. But wait, does the last set go beyond 488? 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's 5 sets. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding them up: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The last occurrence is 488. Let's calculate how many times. Using the same method as before: (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many full sets? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, for the first four sets, each has 10 numbers, contributing 10 each, so 4*10=40. The last set has 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. So total in tens place is 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, subtracting the number of 8's from 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I should think of it as (488 // 10) + 1 if the last number is 484. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor division gives 48, but since 484 is included, it's 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. Wait, but 401-488 includes the 400s, so the tens place can be 4 in 400-409, 410-419, etc. Wait, no, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. So, that's 5 blocks of 10 numbers each. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, the last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor division gives 48, but since 488 is included, it's 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks? From 1-488, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. So, the tens place is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, check if 480-489 is included, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 in 480-488 is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, does that mean the tens digit 8 in the 400s is only 9 numbers? Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but 480 is part of the 400s. So, the tens digit 8 in the 400s is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the total for the tens place would be 4 blocks of 10 (from 1-400) plus 9 numbers in 480-488. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 4 blocks, each 10, so 40, but now I'm adding 9 more, making it 49. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify: The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 blocks. The first four are complete, each with 10 numbers, and the fifth is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total is 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (1-488):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place (1-488):** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place (400-488):** The digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place (1-488):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488.

    "text": " Maybe I should calculate it as (488 // 10) + 1 if the last number is 484. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which gives 48 full decades, so 48 times 10, but since 484 is the last 4 in the units place, that would be 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated as the number of complete groups of 10. So, for page numbers up to N, it's floor(N/10). But since 488 is not a multiple of 10, the units digit cycles 48 full times (from 1 to 480), giving 48 occurrences, and then from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more at 484. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, that makes sense. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 1-100, there's 40-49 (10 numbers). In 101-200, it's 140-149 (another 10). Similarly, 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, total tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is only 4 in these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 4's: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, from 481-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, it's included. So, units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 occurrences. Let's see how many such blocks are within 488. From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Now, does 480-489 fall within 488? Yes, 480-488 is part of the tens block 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in all these numbers, so that's 9 occurrences. But wait, earlier I thought each block contributes 10, but in this case, the last block is incomplete because the book ends at 488. So, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers. So, the tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 8 in tens place. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Okay, that seems right. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear, so 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should think of it as (488 + 1) divided by 10, but wait, no, because 488 is the last page. Let me recast this. The number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated by considering how many complete groups of 10 there are in the range. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8). Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, the last group goes up to 488, which is 488 = 48*10 + 8. So, in the 49th group, which would be 480-488, the units digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the 4 in the units place occurs at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many such sets there are. From 1 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49, that's one set; 140-149 is another; 240-249, another; 340-349, another; and 440-449, another. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50. However, I need to check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, it's valid. So, 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. This occurs in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. How many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences of 8 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, let's count each set. - 80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9, so 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences here. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yes, that seems right. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Wait, no, because from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each complete set of 10, there's one 4 in the units place. The number of complete sets is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 484 fall within 488? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, the units place 4's would be 48 times? Or is it 49? Let me think. From 1 to 480, how many 4's in the units place? 4,14,24,...,474,484. That's 48 numbers because 484 is the 48th occurrence. Wait, 4 is the first, 14 is the second, ..., 484 is the (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49th occurrence. So, maybe it's 49 times. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try a smaller number to test. Suppose the book has 14 pages. How many 4's in the units place? 4 and 14, so two times. Using the formula: 14//10=1, so 1, but actually, it's 2. So, the formula would be (14 + 9) //10= (23)//10=2, which is correct. Alternatively, it's (n + 9) //10. So, for 488, it's (488 + 9) //10=497//10=49. So, 49 times in the units place. Okay, so units place 4's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks are there up to 488. The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Now, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, total tens place 4's: 5 blocks *10=50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1=89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89)=49+50=99, 99+89=188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. So, 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, okay. Now, let's count the number of 8's. 8's can be in units, tens, or hundreds place. Let's do the same breakdown. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8's in units place occur every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, how many such numbers? Using the same method: (488 + 9) //10=497//10=49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8's in the tens place occur in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many complete blocks? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, so 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's)=90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.

So, 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so there are 48 full sets, each contributing an 8 in the units place, plus an extra 8 at 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. Let's see how many such blocks exist up to 488. From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, that's only 9 numbers because 489 is beyond 488. So, for the 400-488 range, the tens place 8's occur from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks with 10 each and one block with 9. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contribution is 0. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: Units place: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. That seems correct. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, I considered 4 full blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. That seems correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because I might have miscounted somewhere. Let me try another approach for the 4's and 8's. Alternatively, I can use a formula for digit counting. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to n is given by floor((n + 1)/10) + (d != 0 ? 1 : 0). Hmm, maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, for each digit position, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear. Let me try that again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: For each 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, total units 4's = floor(488 / 10) + (if the last digit is >=4, add 1). Wait, 488 /10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. Since the last page is 488, the units digit is 8, which is >=4, so add 1. So, 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: For each 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). So, how many full hundreds are there? 488 is 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) plus 88 more (400-488). So, for each full hundred, 10 times in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40. Now, in the partial hundred (400-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, 40-49 in the tens place would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 more. So total tens place 4's:40 +10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: Similarly, 488 /10=48.8, floor is 48. Since the last digit is 8, which is >=8, so add 1. So, 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: For each full hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89). There are 4 full hundreds, so 4\u00d710=40. In the partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 +9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: As before, no 8's in the hundreds place up to 488. So, 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - From 400 to 488, 4 appears in the hundreds place for 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, 8 appears once (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n   - From 400-488, 8 appears in the tens place for 9 numbers (480-488).\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No 8's appear in the hundreds place up to 488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last group is 480-488, which includes 484. So, that's 9 numbers in that last group (481-489, but since we stop at 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. But how many 4's in the units place in that last group? Only 484, so that's one 4. So, for the units place, the total number of 4's would be 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 (484), totaling 49. Hmm, maybe I should use a formula instead. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n can be calculated as floor(n/10) + (1 if the units digit of n is >= d else 0). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. For each digit place, the count can be determined by how many full cycles of 10 there are and then the remainder. So, for units place, the number of 4's is floor(488/10) = 48. But if the last digit is >=4, we add 1. Since 488 ends with 8, which is greater than 4, so we add 1, making it 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, moving on to the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last group is 440-449. Let me count how many full groups of 100 there are. From 1-488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 400-488. In each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49 in each hundred). So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's another 10 numbers, so 10 more 4's. So, total 40 + 10 = 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, total 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me check if I did that right. Units: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? Let's use the same method as before. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups. Each group contributes one 8. But since 488 ends with 8, which is equal to 8, we add 1. So, 48 +1=49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so the last group is 480-488. Let's count: Each full hundred (1-99, 100-199, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 4 full hundreds would give 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 +1=9 numbers. So, 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)= 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's)=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: Units:49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total:188. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total:98. Difference:188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check the hundreds place again for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct. And for 8's, since the book only goes up to 488, there's no hundreds digit of 8. So, yes, 0. For the tens place of 8's, in the last partial hundred, 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, 40 (from full hundreds) +9=49. Units place for 8's:49, as 488 ends with 8, so 488/10=48.8, so 48 full groups, plus 1 for the last digit, totaling 49. So, 49 units, 49 tens, 0 hundreds, total 98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Total occurrences:  \n     - Complete groups of 10: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\)  \n     - Since 488 ends with 8, which is \u2265 4, add 1: \\( 48 + 1 = 49 \\)  \n   - **Total in units place:** 49\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences.  \n   - Complete hundreds (1-399): \\( 4 \\times 10 = 40 \\)  \n   - In 400-488, 440-449 contributes another 10:  \n   - **Total in tens place:** \\( 40 + 10 = 50 \\)\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488.  \n   - Total numbers: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\)  \n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89\n\n**Total number of 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\)\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Total occurrences:  \n     - Complete groups of 10: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\)  \n     - Since 488 ends with 8, add 1: \\( 48 + 1 = 49 \\)  \n   - **Total in units place:** 49\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences.  \n   - Complete hundreds (1-399): \\( 4 \\times 10 = 40 \\)  \n   - In 400-488, 480-488 contributes 9 occurrences:  \n   - **Total in tens place:** \\( 40 + 9 = 49 \\)\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 0\n\n**Total number of 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\)\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\)\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should calculate it as (488 // 10) + 1? Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 484 is within 488, it's 49 times. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488. There are 48 complete sets (48*10=480) and then 8 more numbers (481-488). In each set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 times from the complete sets, and then in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so no additional 4's. So, total 4's in the units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in the blocks 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, similar to the 4's, how many times? From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. The last number is 488, which ends with 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is within the range, so it's 49 times. So, units place: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks. Each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. But wait, 480-489 would be another block, but since the book only goes up to 488, the 480-488 range is 9 numbers (480-488). So, in the tens place, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them except 488? Wait, no, 480-488: the tens digit is 8 in all these numbers because 480 is 4 8 0, 481 is 4 8 1, up to 488. So, actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them. So, that's 9 occurrences. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) which is 40, plus the 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks of 10 (40) plus 9 from 480-488, total 49. Hmm, but wait, 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check the units place for 4's again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 4 + (n-1)*10 \u2264488. Let's solve for n: (n-1)*10 \u2264484 \u2192 n-1 \u226448.4 \u2192 n\u226449.4, so n=49. So, 49 times. Wait, earlier I thought units place for 4's was 48, but now it's 49. Did I make a mistake earlier? Let me check. When I did units place for 4's, I thought 488//10=48, but 488 is included, so 488//10=48, but 488 is 488, which is 48*10 +8, so the units digit is 8, not 4. So, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is 48*10 +4. So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place for 4's is 49. Wait, but earlier I thought units place for 4's was 48. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. So, units place for 4's: 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers. So, units=49. Then, tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and how many blocks? From 0-488, the blocks are 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Wait, but earlier I thought 4's were 187, but now it's 188. Hmm, let me recount. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's=188. Now, for 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, so earlier I thought 4's were 187, but now it's 188. So, I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify. Units place for 4's: 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. So, units=49. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, 5 blocks, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. So, 4's=188. 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. So, difference=188-98=90. Wait, but earlier I thought units place for 4's was 48, but now it's 49. So, the correct total is 188-98=90. But let me check the 8's again. Units place for 8's: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The last term is 488, which is 48*10 +8. So, the number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units=49. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Wait, earlier I thought 4 blocks of 10 and 9 from 480-488, but actually, 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, that's 4*10 +9=49. So, tens=49. So, total 8's=49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but earlier I thought the difference was 89, but now it's 90. So, I think I made a mistake in the initial count of 4's in the units place. So, the correct difference is 90. But wait, let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I should use a formula to count the number of times a digit appears in each position. For a given digit d and position (units, tens, hundreds), the count can be calculated as follows: For units place: number of times d appears = (n // 10) * 1 + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0). But wait, that's for numbers up to n. Let me see. Alternatively, for each digit position, the count is calculated by:\n\n- For units place: count = (n // 10) * 1 + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0), but only if d != 0.\n- For tens place: count = (n // 100) * 10 + (min(max(n % 100 - 10*(d-1), 0), 10) if d != 0 else (n % 100) + 1)\n- For hundreds place: similar logic.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to think in terms of how many full cycles of 10, 100, etc., there are.\n\nLet me try to calculate the number of 4's again using this method.\n\n**Units place for 4's:**\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: 488 // 10 = 48. Each group contributes 1 occurrence. So, 48*1=48.\n\nNow, check the remainder: 488 % 10 =8. Since 8 >=4, we add 1 more occurrence. So, total units=48+1=49.\n\n**Tens place for 4's:**\n\nNumber of complete groups of 100: 488 // 100 =4. Each group contributes 10 occurrences (40-49, etc.). So, 4*10=40.\n\nNow, the remainder is 488 % 100 =88. The tens digit can be 4 in the range 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Since 88 >=40, we add 10 occurrences. So, total tens=40+10=50.\n\n**Hundreds place for 4's:**\n\nNumber of complete groups of 1000: 488 // 1000=0. So, 0*100=0.\n\nThe remainder is 488 % 1000=488. The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, 488-400+1=89 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 4's=49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\n**Units place for 8's:**\n\n488 //10=48, so 48 occurrences.\n\nRemainder=8, which is >=8, so add 1. Total units=48+1=49.\n\n**Tens place for 8's:**\n\n488 //100=4, so 4*10=40.\n\nRemainder=88. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers. Since 88 >=80, add 10. So, tens=40+10=50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 49. Hmm, let me check. Wait, no, 80-89 is 10 numbers, and 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them. So, in the tens place, for 8's:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 100:4, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40.\n\nRemainder=88. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers, but in the remainder 88, the tens digit is 8 in 80-88, which is 9 numbers. Wait, no, the remainder is 88, which is the last two digits. So, the tens digit is 8 in 80-88, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, the count is 4*10 +9=49.\n\nWait, but using the formula, it's (n//100)*10 + (min(10, n%100 - 10*(d-1) +1)).\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. The tens digit is 8 in the range 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges is 10 numbers, and the last is 9. So, total tens=4*10 +9=49.\n\nSo, tens place for 8's=49.\n\n**Hundreds place for 8's:**\n\n488//1000=0, so 0*100=0.\n\nRemainder=488. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800-899, but 488<800, so 0.\n\nSo, total 8's=49(units)+49(tens)+0=98.\n\nSo, total 4's=188, total 8's=98. Difference=188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 90, but I'm now confused because initially I thought it was 89. I think the correct difference is 90. Let me check once more.\n\nYes, 4's=188, 8's=98, so 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but in the initial calculation, I thought 4's were 187, but after correcting the units place, it's 188. So, the difference is 90.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I should think of it as (488 // 10) + 1 if the last number is included. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer division gives 48, but since 484 is within 488, it's 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens from page 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then 8 in 488. Wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 times. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, how many blocks? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never is 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 188. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. Difference: 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me check the units place for 4's again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then every 10. So, 4,14,24,...,484. The last one is 484, which is 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. That seems correct. For tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. That's 5 blocks, each 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. For 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So total 8's:98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488.

There are 0 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range has 10 numbers. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, instead of 10, it's 9. So, the first four ranges give 4*10=40, and the last one gives 9, so total 49 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the difference is number of 4's minus number of 8's: 188 - 98 = 90.

Hmm, maybe I should think differently. For each full set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 484, which is another 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: starting from 40-49 (first set), then 140-149 (second set), 240-249 (third set), 340-349 (fourth set), and 440-449 (fifth set). But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But in each of these, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484: that's (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Tens place: each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89. So total 4's: 49 +50 +89=188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The last number is 488, which is included. So, the count is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: 80-89 is the first set, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. The next would be 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, the range 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, for the tens place, we have 4 complete sets (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389), each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Additionally, in the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So total tens place 8's:40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me check again. Units place 4's:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 4's:188. Units place 8's:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 8's:98. So, 188-98=90.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so in each block of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 fours. But wait, the 48th block ends at 480, so the next number is 481 to 488. In this incomplete block, does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, 484 is within 481-488, so that's an additional 4. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? Well, in the hundreds place, we can have 0 (for numbers 40-49), 1 (140-149), 2 (240-249), 3 (340-349), and 4 (440-449). So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? Let me check. 440-449 is within 1-488, so yes, all 10 numbers are valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 for numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place. That's 48 eights. Now, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 is within 481-488, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** 8's in the tens place occur in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. Let's count how many such ranges there are. The hundreds digit can be 0 (80-89), 1 (180-189), 2 (280-289), 3 (380-389), and 4 (480-488). So, 5 ranges. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges * 10 = 40, plus 9 from the last range, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's: units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. Now the 8's: units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. 49 + 49 is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems right. Wait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. When I counted the tens place, I considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. So, for each hundreds place, except the last one, there are 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, for 0-99, 80-89 is 10 numbers. For 100-199, 180-189 is 10. For 200-299, 280-289 is 10. For 300-399, 380-389 is 10. For 400-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 49, as calculated. So, total 98 eights. So, 188 -98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each of the first four ranges contributes 10, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** None, as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think again. Maybe the formula is (n - a) / d + 1, where a is the first term, d is the difference. So, a=4, d=10, n=484. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Yeah, so 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one set. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another set. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50 times. But wait, does the last set go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, so 5 sets. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me add that again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. Yep, 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, does 488 count? Yes, because the last page is 488. So, how many such numbers? Using the same formula: a=8, d=10, n=488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, let's see how many full sets we have. From 0-99: 80-89 is one set (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: 480-488. So, that's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, that's 9 numbers instead of 10. So, the first four sets each have 10 numbers, and the last set has 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me think again. The first set is 80-89: 10 numbers. Then 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4\u00d710=40 plus 9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488).\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Count the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I should think of it as (488 // 10) + 1? Wait, no, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would give 48 full decades, each contributing a 4 in the units place. But since 488 is the last page, the 48th decade would be 480-488. So, in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many 4's? Let's see: from 1-480, there are 48 occurrences (480/10=48). Then, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so no additional 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which would be in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 540-549 isn't. So, how many such blocks are there? Each block is 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count the blocks: - 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nThat's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, total tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but the problem is only about the digit 4, so yes, each of these contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 4's: 89. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Let me double-check that. Units: 48, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. Seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 is page 488, so units digit is 8. So, how many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block. Let's see how many blocks there are. Each block is 10 numbers, contributing 10 8's in the tens place. So: - 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, as 488 - 480 +1 =9)\n\nWait, so the first four blocks each have 10 numbers, but the last block only has 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, total 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place 8's: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units: 49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. Hmm, but wait, in the tens place, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place, correct? So, that's 9, plus the other four blocks of 10 each, so 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, yes, that's correct. So, total 8's:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 -98=89. Wait, that's a big number. Let me check my calculations again. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=48+50=98+89=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I feel like that might be correct, but let me think again. Another way to count the 4's: in each digit position, how many times does 4 appear. For units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4, so 488//10=48, but since 488 is included, and 488//10=48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing a 4 in the units place, so 48. Then, in the tens place: every 100 numbers have 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, so 488//100=4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, the remaining 88 numbers (from 400-488) have another 9 4's in the tens place (440-449), so 9 more, making tens place 4's=40+9=49. Wait, no, that's not right because earlier I thought of it as 5 blocks of 10 each. Wait, maybe I'm confusing. Let me use the standard digit counting method. The formula for counting digits in each position is as follows:\n\nFor a given digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated by:\n\n- Split the number into higher, current, and lower parts.\n- If the current digit is greater than d, add (higher +1)*10^lower_digits\n- If equal, add higher *10^lower_digits + (lower +1)\n- If less, add higher *10^lower_digits\n\nBut maybe that's too formulaic. Alternatively, for each position, calculate how many times 4 appears.\n\nLet me try for 4's:\n\nUnits place:\n\n- The number of complete groups of 10 is 488//10=48. Each group has one 4 in the units place, so 48*1=48.\n- The remainder is 488%10=8. Since 8 >=4, we add 1 more (for the 4 in 484). So total units 4's:48+1=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Wait, 488//10=48, remainder 8. So, the number of 4's in units place is 48 (from 0-480), and then in 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place 4's:49.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought units place 4's were 48, but now using this method, it's 49. Hmm, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let me check: pages 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The first term is 4, last term is 484. The common difference is 10, so the number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place 4's:49.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\n- The number of complete groups of 100 is 488//100=4. Each group contributes 10 4's in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4*10=40.\n- The remainder is 488%100=88. Now, in the current group (400-488), how many numbers have 4 in the tens place? From 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is fully included, so 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's:40+10=50.\n\nWait, but 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds digit is 4 only up to 488. So, the tens place 4's are 50.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\n- The number of complete groups of 1000 is 0, since 488<1000.\n- The hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488-400+1=89), each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 4's:89.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 187, but now it's 188. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again.\n\nWait, using this method, units place 4's:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place was 48, but now it's 49. So, perhaps I was wrong earlier, and the correct number of 4's is 188.\n\nSimilarly, let's recount the 8's using this method.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- Complete groups of 10:488//10=48, each contributing one 8, so 48.\n- Remainder:488%10=8. Since 8>=8, we add 1 more (for 488). So, units place 8's:48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Complete groups of 100:488//100=4, each contributing 10 8's (e.g.,80-89,180-189, etc.), so 4*10=40.\n- Remainder:488%100=88. In the current group (400-488), how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? From 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, tens place 8's:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- Since 488<800, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's:0.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nSo, now, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. Difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 187, but now it's 188, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me make a table to keep track.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal:49+50+89=188\n\nCounting 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut earlier, I thought units place 4's were 48, but now it's 49. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial count.\n\nWait, let's take a concrete example. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The numbers are 4,14,24,34,44,54,...,484. The first number is 4, last is 484. The number of terms is (484-4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place 4's:49.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, the numbers are 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50. So, tens place 4's:50.\n\nIn the hundreds place, numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 4's:89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place:8,18,28,...,488. First term 8, last term 488. Number of terms: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49.\n\nTens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. The first four blocks have 10 numbers each, contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (since 488-480+1=9), each with an 8 in the tens place.

So, the correct difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding how many more 4's are printed than 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). \n     - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 484 is the 49th occurrence).\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n     - Number of blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n     - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.\n     - Total: 5 * 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n     - Number of pages: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n     - Total: 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n     - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 488 is the 49th occurrence).\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n     - Number of complete blocks: 4 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 occurrences.\n     - Remaining pages: 480-488, contributing 9 occurrences.\n     - Total: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No pages in a 488-page book have 8 in the hundreds place.\n     - Total: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I should think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated by taking the total number of pages divided by 10, then taking the integer part, and adding 1 if the digit appears in the last partial set. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to calculate it as (total pages + 1) // 10. Let me test this formula. For units digit 4, it's (488 + 1) // 10 = 489 // 10 = 48.9, which truncates to 48. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but actually, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is 484 = 48*10 + 4. So, yes, 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the total number of pages, so the last page is 488. So, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many full tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the first 10 pages are 1-10, so 4 is in 4, then 14, 24, ..., up to 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, each number has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is included. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let's check: from 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), not 10. So, in the hundreds place, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) contribute 10 each, so 4*10=40. The last range, 480-488, contributes 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (since 480-488: the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers). So, total in tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, 9, not 10. So, 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, etc.) contribute 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. That's correct. So, yes, 98 8's. So, the difference is 187-98=89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). \n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\) times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Number of ranges: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, so \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\) times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in page numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\) times.\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\) times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Number of full ranges: 4 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 numbers, so \\( 4 \\times 10 = 40 \\) times.\n   - The last range 480-488 contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Total in tens place: \\( 40 + 9 = 49 \\) times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:** \\( 187 - 98 = 89 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Let me confirm: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, but since we start counting from 0, it's actually 49 times. Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think again. If I consider the units digit, for each set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 times. But wait, the last set is 480-488, which includes 484, so that's the 49th occurrence. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48.9, which is 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, the 48th ten ends at 480, and then 481-488 is the 49th set. So, in the units place, the number of 4's is 49? Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, and 488 is beyond 480, so in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many 4's are there? Let me list them: 4,14,24,34,44,54,...,484. So, starting at 4, every 10 numbers. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This occurs in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are up to 488. The first is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five ranges. Each contributes 10, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so yes, 50 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's. The 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many there are. The last occurrence is 488, which is the units digit. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. So, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. The first four are complete, each contributing 10, and the last one is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, but only 9 times. So, total in the tens place: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4 * 10 = 40, plus the 480-488 which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences here. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Total: 5 * 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89 times.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 40 times, and 480-488 contributes 9 times.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0 times.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me confirm: The formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor((n + 1)/10). So, (488 + 1)/10 = 489/10 = 48.9, so floor(48.9) = 48. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Hmm, maybe I should use a better method. Alternatively, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so the number of 4's in the units place is 48 times, right? Because 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges are there. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then, 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Wait, but I'm only interested in the hundreds digit being 4, which is true for all these numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but actually, from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 count? Yes. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's calculate. The first occurrence is at 8, then every 10 numbers after that. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers? Let's use the formula: floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48.9, so 48 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so that would be 49 times. Because from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? Let me list them: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Each full range (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 numbers, but the last one (480-488) contributes only 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, how many full ranges are there? 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 440-449. Let's count how many full sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, and each contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. From 40-49: 10 numbers, 10 times. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 times, so 5\u00d710=50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's one more, making it 49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check how many such sets are there within 488. 80-89: yes, 10 numbers. 180-189: yes, 10. 280-289: yes, 10. 380-389: yes, 10. 480-489: but our book ends at 488, so only 480-488. That's 9 numbers. So, for the tens place: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the difference is number of 4's minus number of 8's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This is 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This is 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book only goes up to 488. This is 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I should think of it as (488 / 10) = 48.8, and then take the floor, which is 48, but since 484 is within 488, maybe it's 49. Wait, let's test it: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, for each ten numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles and a partial cycle. In each full cycle, there's one 4. So, 48 times. Now, in the partial cycle, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 is included, which adds one more 4. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. The first range is 40-49, which is within 1-488. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440 is 440, which is okay. So, 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50. So, 50 times 4 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many times. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, in the partial cycle from 481-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included, adding one more 8. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is a partial range because 488 is the last page. So, let's count each range. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 is included and 488 is the end). So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book has 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial ten, from 481-488, 484 is included, so one more, total 49. That seems right. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d710=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. Now for 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, 48 numbers, plus 488, which is 49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think of it as (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Yeah, that makes sense. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then, each hundred has another 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 440-449 is within 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many such ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. So that's 4 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Now, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. Wait, no, because 480-489 is a full set, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, no, that's not right. Because 480-488 is part of the hundreds place, but the tens digit is 8. So, in the tens place, 8 can appear in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems too high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I feel like maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. In the tens place, 8's occur in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, 49 in the tens place. Units place: 8's occur every 10 numbers, starting at 8, up to 488. So, (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. So, total 8's:49+49=98. 4's:188. Difference:188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me confirm: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're only considering up to 484 for the units place, it's 48 full tens plus one more (484), making it 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place is a bit different. The 4 can only appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Wait, but let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. To find how many, I can divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, 8,18,...,488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full tens, and then the 49th number is 488. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with an 8 in the tens place. How many such blocks? From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, that's only 9 numbers because 489 is beyond 488. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens place 8 occurs from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many blocks? 4 full blocks (80-89, etc.) each with 10, and the last block with 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units Place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's a total of 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50 times. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, because 449 is within 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's count these. The first is 8, the last is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, which would be 48 x 10 = 480, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no: 8,18,...,488. Let me check: 488 is the 49th number because 488 / 10 = 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Let me count how many blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers except the last one, which has 9 numbers (from 480 to 488). So, 4 blocks with 10 numbers each and 1 block with 9 numbers. So, 4 x 10 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For 4's: units place up to 484: 484 /10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449: 5 blocks, each 10 numbers, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. Total 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place up to 488: 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488: 5 blocks, but the last one is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks with 10 and 1 with 9: 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place: none. Total 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, the 48th group would end at 480, and then 481-488 would be the 49th group. But in the units place, only 484 has a 4. So, actually, in the units place, the number of 4's is 49 because from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place, starting at 4 and ending at 484. So, that's 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490), but wait, 488 is less than 490, so maybe it's 48 complete decades plus the 484. So, 48*1 +1=49. Hmm, I think that's correct. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, counting how many times 4 appears in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range would be 440-449, which is fully included. Let's count how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49 (that's the first set), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, how many times? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be the next set, but the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many complete sets we have. The first set is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers because 488 is the last page). So, total number of 8's in the tens place is 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 4*10 +9=49.\n\nWait, no. Let me check again. The ranges are:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nSo, total is 4*10 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 49, and in the tens place, 49, so total 98.\n\nWait, but when counting the tens place, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49 for tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 188 and 8's are 98, so the difference would be 188-98=90. But let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49.\n\nTens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers. How many ranges? From 40-49 (1), 140-149 (2), 240-249 (3), 340-349 (4), 440-449 (5). So, 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? ((488-8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49.\n\nTens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, and the last one has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, as the book doesn't reach 800.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I thought about the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds: total 98.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and taking the floor. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the last group is from 480 to 488, which includes 484. So, in this case, the units digit 4 appears 49 times because 488 is the last page, and 484 is included. So, maybe it's 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 (484), totaling 49. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. Each group of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one number ending with 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many such groups are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, which gives 48. But then, in the last partial group (481-488), there's 484, which is another 4. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, so units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. The first is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 50 times. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, but each of these contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But in the last partial group (481-488), 488 is included, which is another 8. So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let me check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: Here, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, how many 8's in the tens place? Each of the first four ranges contributes 10, and the last contributes 9. So, 4 * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems right. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Yes, that seems correct.

So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are. The first is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. But wait, actually, when considering the hundreds place, each number contributes one 4 in that position. So, yes, 89 times. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, is that right? Let me check again. Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number is 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, how many such numbers? Using the same method: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let's count how many ranges there are. 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. The last one is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, the first four ranges give 4*10=40, and the last one gives 9. So total in the tens place is 40 + 9 =49. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =49 +49=98. So, 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the 4's and 8's. Starting with 4's: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 is correct. For 8's, in the tens place, I had 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 488-480+1=9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 in the tens place. Units place: 49, tens:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Let me check again. The tens place for 4's: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So that's correct. So, 50 in the tens place. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, difference is 90. Wait, but I'm thinking, does the page number 488 count as having an 8 in the units place? Yes, because 488 has two 8's: one in the tens and one in the units. So, in the units place, 488 is counted, and in the tens place, it's also counted. So, that's correct. So, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, for units place, it's floor(488/10) = 48. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. But when I list them, it's 4,14,24,...,484, which is 49 numbers because 484 is the 49th. Hmm, maybe the formula is floor((N + 1)/10). Let me test that: (488 + 1)/10 = 489/10 = 48.9, floor is 48. Still 48. But when I count manually, it's 49. So perhaps the formula isn't directly applicable here because 488 is not a multiple of 10. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last number with a 4 in the units place is 484. So, from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? Let's see: 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 gives 49. So, 49 times. So maybe the formula is (last occurrence - first occurrence)/step +1. So, yes, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 540-549 would be beyond 488. So, how many full decades do we have? From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fully fit into 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, step 10. Number of terms: (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is valid. So, how many full ranges? 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So total in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens: 49 +49=98. Now, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range has 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four ranges have 10 each, and the last has 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think again: starting from 4, adding 10 each time. So, the count is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many such sets there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 488 is beyond that, so we don't have to worry about truncation here. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But we're only interested in the hundreds digit being 4, which is all these numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see: From 1-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is 10. From 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is the end). Wait, so for the hundreds place, 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, for the tens place, the count is 4 sets of 10 (from 1-399) and 1 set of 9 (from 400-488). So, total is 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
