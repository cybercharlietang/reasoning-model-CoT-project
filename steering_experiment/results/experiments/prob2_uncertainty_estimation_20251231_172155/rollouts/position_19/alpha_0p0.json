    "text": " Hmm, maybe I should calculate it differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. So, 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then an extra 4 in 484. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, the last group is 480-488, which includes 484. So, yes, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, 440-449 is only up to 449, and the book goes up to 488, so does that affect anything? No, because 440-449 is entirely within 400-488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4 in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. Starting at 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then an extra 8 in 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with an 8 in the tens place. Let's count the ranges: 0-99: 80-89 (10). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so that's 9 numbers, not 10. So, for the hundreds place, 400-488, the tens place 8's are only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) each contribute 10, and the last one contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, starting at 4 and ending at 484.

    "text": " Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place up to 488 would be the number of times 4 is in that position. So, for each ten's group (like 0-9, 10-19, ..., 480-489), the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, 4 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete groups of ten are there up to 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups (each contributing one 4 in the units place) and then an incomplete group from 480 to 488, which has 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, in that incomplete group, 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, from 1 to 488, the units digit 4 appears 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these groups has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such groups are there? Let's see: The first group is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. So that's 5 groups. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 groups \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 groups, each contributing 10 4's, so 50. But wait, in the group 440-449, the tens digit is 4, so each of those 10 numbers has a 4 in the tens place. So, that's correct. So, total tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 to 488 is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. The incomplete group is 480-488, which includes 488, so that's one more 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in groups like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 group, but only up to 488. Each of these groups has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, how many such groups are there? Let's list them: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. So that's 5 groups. But wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 only for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them except 480-488? Wait, no, in 480-489, the tens digit is 8, so 480-488 is part of that. So, the full group would be 480-489, but since our book stops at 488, we have 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (480-488). So, each group of tens place 8 contributes 10 numbers, except the last one which contributes 9. So, how many full groups do we have? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 groups \u00d710 =40, plus 9 from the last group, total 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4\u00d710=40 +9=49. So, total tens place 8's:49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 can appear in the hundreds place. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place 8's:0. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. Difference:188 -98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through the 4's again. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. That's 5 groups, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers. 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now, 8's: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check: from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 -400 +1=89. Yes, that's correct. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. For 8's, in the tens place, I counted 49. Let me check that again. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4\u00d710=40 +9=49. That seems correct. Units place:49, tens:49, total 98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in groups like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Number of groups: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Each group contributes 10 4's: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in page numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89 (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in groups like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Number of groups: 5 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488).\n   - Each group contributes 10 8's except the last group, which contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then a partial group from 481 to 488, which includes 484 as the 4 in the units place. So, that would be 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then each hundred has another 10: 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many ranges? 40-49 is the first, then each subsequent hundred adds another. So, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, it's valid. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then a partial group from 481 to 488, which includes 488 as the 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last range. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last one, which contributes 9 numbers (from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check if 480-488 is 9 numbers. From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So yes, 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the Number of 4's:**\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, 484 is within 488, so yes, it's included. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This occurs in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This occurs in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488. So, 488 is included, so it's 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This occurs in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, how many ranges? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers). So, the first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0-4. So, 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484.

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. The number of times a digit appears in the units place up to N can be calculated by (N // 10) + 1 if the units digit is >= the target digit. Wait, actually, the formula is a bit different. For units digit, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to N is floor((N + 1)/10) if d is 0, else floor((N + 1)/10). But since we're starting from 1, maybe it's better to calculate manually. Alternatively, since 488 is the last page, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, there are 48 full tens (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490, but wait, 488 is less than 490, so actually, up to 480, there are 48 full tens, and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, in each full ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, each hundred has a block where the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. Let's count how many such blocks there are up to 488. The blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. However, we need to check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, total 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, so from 8 to 488 with step 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks are within 488. The blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 4*10=40 8's in the tens place. Wait, but 380-389 is within 488, and the next block would be 480-489, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is part of the next block. So, in the tens place, 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers here. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 40, plus 9 from 480-488. So total 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, no, because 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8, but only up to 488. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 for all 9 of them. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's) = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. 48+50=98; 98+89=187. Correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. Correct. So, 187-98=89. Yeah, that seems right. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a '4' in the units place. There are 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490) but since the book ends at 488, the last set is 481-488, which doesn't include a units '4'. So, 48 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** Every 100 numbers have a block where the tens digit is '4' (e.g., 40-49, 140-149). There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 '4's. So, 5\u00d710=50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, the hundreds digit is '4' for all 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers have an '8' in the units place, from 8, 18, ..., 488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** Every 100 numbers have a block where the tens digit is '8' (e.g., 80-89, 180-189). There are 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 40 '8's, plus an additional 9 from 480-488. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No page numbers have '8' in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - More '4's than '8's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has a 10-number block where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49 is the first block (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 only for 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. Let's count how many such blocks are there up to 488. 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40 times. Wait, does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the tens digit is 8 from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 blocks of 10 and an additional 9 numbers in the 480-488 range. So, 4*10 +9=49 times in the tens place. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, which is in the hundreds place. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, so that's 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 4 blocks (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) each with 10 numbers, so 4*10=40, plus 9 numbers in 480-488, so total 40+9=49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98 times. Now, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in page numbers 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and additionally in 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 4 such blocks, plus 9 numbers in 480-488.\n   - Total: 4*10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in 800-899 exist since the book only has 488 pages.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I should think of it as (488 // 10) + 1. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, and then we check if the last number is beyond 488. Wait, 48*10 = 480, so 480 + 4 = 484, which is less than 488, so we have 49 numbers. Wait, no, because from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor((488 + 1)/10). Wait, that formula might not be accurate. Let me think again. For each complete set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, there are 480/10 = 48 occurrences. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is within this range, adding one more occurrence. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-489 isn't fully included because the book ends at 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). From 1-99, that's one block, so 10 times. From 100-199, another 10 times. From 200-299, another 10. From 300-399, another 10. From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. Wait, but 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10 (1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 50 times. Wait, but 400-488: the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me check that again. Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high, but let me think. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers, so that's correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? The first occurrence is at 8, the last is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, and then 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is included, so it's 49 times. Wait, but let me check: from 1-480, that's 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of 10, so 48 eights in the units place. Then, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is included, adding one more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 includes 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in each block of 100, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers, except the last block where it's only 9. So, how many blocks? From 1-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is 10. From 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. For 8's: Units: 49, Tens: 49, Hundreds: 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 is correct. For the tens place, I think I might have made a mistake. Wait, in the tens place for 4's, I had 10 occurrences in each of the first four centuries (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), and then 10 in 400-488 (440-449). So, 4 times 10 is 40, plus 10 is 50. That seems correct. For 8's in the tens place, I had 10 in each of the first four centuries and 9 in the last part (480-488). So, 4 times 10 is 40, plus 9 is 49. That seems correct. Units place for both 4 and 8: 49 each. So, yes, 188 - 98 = 90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I was wrong earlier. So, perhaps the number of 4's in the units place is 49. Let me verify that. The formula is (last occurrence - first occurrence)/interval + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Yes, that's correct. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's look at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449. Let's count how many sets there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, the number of 4's in the tens place is 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The numbers from 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let's see: each set from 80-89, 180-189, etc., gives 10 numbers. How many such sets are there? From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. And 480-488: how many numbers? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, total for tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 ranges in total, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times in the tens place. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in these, the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many times this happens. The last occurrence is at 488, which is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place, such as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. Now, does 480-489 fall within 488? Yes, 480-488 is part of the book. So, how many ranges? From 0-99: 80-89 is one range, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. Similarly, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, for the hundreds place, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, we have four full ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10, so that's 4*10=40. Then, the partial range 480-488 contributes 9. So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, checking the 4's: Units place: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: Units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the 4's in the hundreds place, I said from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. Let me check that: 488-400+1=89. That's correct. Now, for the 8's in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's five ranges. Wait, no: 80-89 is in 0-99, then 180-189 in 100-199, 280-289 in 200-299, 380-389 in 300-399, and 480-488 in 400-488. So that's five ranges, each with 10 except the last one, which is 9. So, 4*10=40 and 9, so 49. That's correct. So, 49 in tens place for 8's. Units place for 8's: from 8,18,...,488. How many terms? Let's see, 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 terms. That's correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again: when I counted the 4's in the hundreds place, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. But each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. But in the 8's, the hundreds place doesn't contribute anything. So, that 89 is a significant factor. So, maybe 90 is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the 4's in the tens place. Let me recount that. For 4's in the tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. So that's five ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct. So, 50 in tens, 49 in units, 89 in hundreds, total 188. For 8's: 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit from the right):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). This results in 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit from the right):** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit from the right):** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488), resulting in 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 numbers, and a partial range 480-488 contributing 9 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 appears 90 times more than the digit 8 in the page numbers.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then, 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, so all 5 ranges are valid. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, let me add them up: units place: 49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. Total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers. Starting from 8,18,28,..., up to 488. The last occurrence in the units place is 488. Let's find how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges there are. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-489 would be the next, but since the book ends at 488, that range is only up to 488, so the tens digit 8 in 480-488 is still 8 in the tens place for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, but I think I should consider each full range first. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Then, 480-488: that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total in the tens place: 4 ranges of 10, which is 40, plus 9 in 480-488, so 49. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me clarify. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, so that's 4*10=40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), so that's 9. So total in tens place: 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0. Total 8's: 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's: Units place: from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers. So, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 full cycles, but since 484 is included, it's 49 times. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So 49+50+89=188. Now for 8's: Units place: from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers. 488/10=48.8, so 49 times. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So total 8's:49+49=98. So difference is 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Hmm, maybe my initial thought was wrong. Let me think again. The number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated by taking the total number of pages, dividing by 10, and then adding 1 if the last page number has that digit in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48. But since 488 ends with an 8, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is within 488. So, actually, it's 49 times because 484 is the 49th number where the units digit is 4. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me use a formula: the number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to number N is floor((N + 1)/10). So for N=488, it's floor(489/10)=48. So, 48 times. But wait, let me test this with a smaller number. If N=14, then floor(15/10)=1, but the units digit 4 appears at 4 and 14, which is 2 times. So, the formula gives 1, which is incorrect. Hmm, maybe I should adjust the formula. Alternatively, the number of times a digit appears in the units place is (N // 10) + 1 if the digit is less than the units digit of N. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think differently. For units place, in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once. So from 1 to 488, there are 48 full blocks of 10 (since 488//10=48), and each block contributes one 4 in the units place. But wait, 48 blocks would cover up to 480, and then we have 481-488. In the 48th block (480-489), the units digit 4 appears at 484. So, in the first 480 numbers, we have 48 occurrences, and then in 481-488, we have one more at 484. So total is 48 +1=49. So, 49 times. Similarly, for the 8's in the units place, let's do the same. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Each block of 10 has one 8 (8,18,...488). 488 is included, so 488 is the last occurrence. So, 488//10=48, and since 488 has 8 in units place, it's 48 +1=49. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. The first is 8, which is the 1st, then 18 is 2nd, ..., 488 is the 49th because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. So, yes, 49 times. So, units place: 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times. So, the difference in units place is 0. Now, moving on to the tens place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there? From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 times. Now, for the digit 8 in the tens place. Similarly, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, how many full blocks? 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last contributes 9. So total is 4*10 +9=49 times. So, tens place: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times. So, the difference here is 1 more 4 than 8. Now, moving on to the hundreds place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times. Now, for the digit 8 in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, 800 is beyond 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 more 4's than 8's. Now, let's sum up the differences from each place. Units place: 0 difference. Tens place: +1. Hundreds place: +89. So total difference is 0+1+89=90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Occur in 4, 14, ..., 484.

From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 140-149 (10) From 200-299: 240-249 (10) From 300-399: 340-349 (10) From 400-488: 440-449 (10) Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, totaling 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but we have to check if 488 is included. Since 488 is the last page, and it has an 8 in the units place, that's the 49th occurrence. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many full blocks there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 180-189 (10) From 200-299: 280-289 (10) From 300-399: 380-389 (10) From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many blocks? 4 full blocks (each contributing 10) and one partial block with 9. So, total 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49 (that's one range), then 140-149 (second), 240-249 (third), 340-349 (fourth), and 440-449 (fifth). So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's fine. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in each of these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's 89 times. Now, let's add up the number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is 488/10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, it's included. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last range. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. So, tens place: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up the number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Let's count these: - 40-49: 10 numbers - 140-149: 10 numbers - 240-249: 10 numbers - 340-349: 10 numbers - 440-449: 10 numbers But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 540-549 would be beyond 488, so we don't need to consider that. So, that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. However, I need to check if 449 is within 488, which it is, so 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. Let's calculate how many times: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but again, we need to check if 488 is included. Starting from 8, the sequence is 8, 18, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count these: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 numbers - 280-289: 10 numbers - 380-389: 10 numbers - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences here. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, there are 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10).

But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is included, so it's 49 times. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's only 9 numbers instead of 10. So, the first four ranges give 4*10=40, and the last gives 9, so total tens place: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up all occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 times. So, digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe digit 4 appears 188 times, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. Subtracting these gives 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 4's. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 can appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, how many 8's in the units place? Let's see: The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is included, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, how many blocks? - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 numbers - 280-289: 10 numbers - 380-389: 10 numbers - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, does 480-488 have 9 numbers? Let's count: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. Yes, that's 9 numbers. So, for the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 8's, and one block of 9 (480-488) contributing 9 8's. So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all pages up to 488, so the hundreds place never has an 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 8's. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For the 4's: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, correct. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's. For the tens place of 4's: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 50 4's. Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers. So, total 4's: 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place:8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so 49 numbers. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, and the last block has 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, no, actually, 484 is the 49th number because 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so we take 48 full sets and then the 49th is 484. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49: that's one range. Then 140-149: another. Then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many ranges? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). But wait, only the hundreds digit is 4, so each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? Starting from 8, then 18, ..., 488. To find how many, let's divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. So, we take the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. The first is 8, and the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many such ranges are within 488. 80-89: yes, that's 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-489 would be the next range, but since the book only goes up to 488, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, we have 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus the partial range 480-488 which has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences (488 - 400 + 1).\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 40, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 fit within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it does. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), right? So, let me check each block. From 1-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 +1 = 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks each contribute 10, and the last contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " Therefore, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place, the 4 can appear in sequences like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within the 488 pages, so that's valid. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 4's. Next, I'll do the same process for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, contributing 4 x 10 = 40 8's. Now, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 8's in the tens place. Therefore, total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 8's. Now, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

This happens in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place, which is the third digit from the right. This happens in the range 400-488. Each number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours.

So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488.

So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me confirm: from 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488 (9). So, yes, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many complete blocks there are. From 1-488, the blocks are: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50.

So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4's appear 188 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488.

The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 occurrences. Let's see how many such blocks exist up to 488. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10. The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, only 480-488 are included, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488). So, the first four blocks are complete, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. The last partial block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, 9 more. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8's appear 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. For the 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. Correct. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place, the 4 can appear in the tens digit from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many complete ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, 449 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up the number of 4's in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Wait, when I thought about the units place, I considered 484 as the last occurrence, which is correct because 484 is 484, and the next would be 494, which is beyond 488. So, from 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. Tens place: 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. So, how many? Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. So, let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 4 ranges of 10, which is 40, plus 9, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the 8's in the tens place. The ranges are 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 in tens place. Units place: 49. So, total 8's: 49+49=98. 4's: 188. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. So, 89. Units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 4's:188. 8's: units 49, tens 49, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range has 10 numbers, totaling 5 ranges.\n   - Number of occurrences: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four ranges have 10 numbers each, and the last range has 9 numbers.\n   - Number of occurrences: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So, I think there are 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-499, there are 50-59, 150-159, etc., but wait, our book only goes up to 488. So, the last range would be 440-449, because 450-459 would be beyond 488 only if we're considering 450-459, but 450 is less than 488, so actually, 440-449 is within, and 450-459 is also within, but 460-469, 470-479, 480-488. Wait, no, the tens digit is 4 only in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these contributes 10 numbers, so 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, let's check the last range: 440-449. 440 is page 440, which is less than 488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, yes, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, 89 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, it's included. So, 49 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers except possibly the last one, which might be cut short. Let's check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers (80-89) - 180-189: 10 numbers - 280-289: 10 numbers - 380-389: 10 numbers - 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences in hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is in the first 100 pages. Then, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, from 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, and so on up to 440-449. So, 5 blocks, 10 each: 50 times. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, all numbers from 400 to 488 have a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4's appear 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, 488 is the 49th number. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me check how many blocks there are. The first block is 80-89, which is 10 numbers. Then 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, how many blocks? 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 numbers, and the last block (480-488) contributing 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me make sure. From 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above. But the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought 4's were 188 and 8's are 98, so the difference would be 90. But let me double-check the 8's count because I might have made a mistake. Let me recount the tens place for 8's. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. Units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So, total 8's:98. Now, number of 4's is 188, 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check again because sometimes when counting, it's easy to miscount. Let me verify the 4's again. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? 484 /10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 blocks, each 10 numbers:50. Correct. Hundreds place:400-488:89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, 8's: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So, 98. So, 188-98=90.

The last occurrence is 488. So, starting from 8, each step of 10. The number of terms can be calculated as (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 8's except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, for the first four blocks, each has 10 8's: 4\u00d710=40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Wait, but let me check the tens place again. The blocks are: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, totaling 4\u00d710 +9=49. So, yes, 49 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block has 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each block except the last has 10 occurrences, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 49th number because 484 = 4 + 10*(48-1). Hmm, maybe I should think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but we also need to check if the last page (488) has a 4 in the units place. 488 ends with an 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 49. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 488/10 = 48.8, so there are 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and then an additional 4 in 484, making it 49. Yeah, that makes sense. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's count how many times. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But 488 is the last page, and 488 ends with an 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the last block. Each full block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, how many full blocks are there? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks. But 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), so in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times there, not 10. So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4, 14, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place, the 4 appears in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449, but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449. Let me calculate how many full decades there are. Each set of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 4. For example, 40-49 is one block, 140-149 is another, and 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. So, that's 5 blocks of 10 numbers each, which is 5*10=50. But wait, in the 440-449 block, does that go up to 449? Since the book goes up to 488, 449 is within the range, so that's fine. So, tens place: 5 blocks * 10 = 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the units digit. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds another 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 times. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each block. - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, adding up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

    "text": " Hmm, maybe my initial thought was wrong. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated by dividing N by 10 and taking the integer part, then adding 1 if the units digit is 4 or higher. Wait, maybe a better approach is to consider how many complete groups of 10 there are and then check the remainder. For units place 4's: The number of times 4 appears is equal to the number of complete tens plus 1 if the units digit is 4 or higher. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, in each of the 48 complete tens, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, the last number is 488, so the units digits go up to 8. So, yes, 4 appears once in the units place in the incomplete group. So, total units place 4's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, counting the number of 4's in the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such ranges are there up to 488? Let's see: The first range is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes. So, 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: From 0-99: 40-49: 10 4's. 100-199: 140-149: 10 4's. 200-299: 240-249: 10 4's. 300-399: 340-349: 10 4's. 400-488: 440-449: 10 4's. So that's 5 ranges, each with 10 4's, so 5*10=50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, but let me think again. For units place, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, and then in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 4 appears once more. So, 48 +1=49, which matches. Tens place: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers. From 0-99: 40-49:10. 100-199:140-149:10. 200-299:240-249:10. 300-399:340-349:10. 400-488:440-449:10. So, that's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. That seems correct. Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each has 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's. The 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many times. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears once more. So, 48 +1=49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit being 8. This occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99:80-89:10 8's. 100-199:180-189:10 8's. 200-299:280-289:10 8's. 300-399:380-389:10 8's. 400-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488-480+1=9). Wait, is that right? 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, the number of 8's is 4 ranges with 10 each (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and one range with 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49+49+0=98. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0. So, 98 8's. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 8's in the tens place. Specifically, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's correct. So, 4 ranges with 10 each (from 80-89, etc.) and one with 9, totaling 49. So, yes, 49 in the tens place. Units place:49, so total 98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - There are 5 such ranges, each contributing 10 occurrences.\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in the range 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - There are 4 full ranges contributing 10 each and one partial range (480-488) contributing 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 1 to 488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, the last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place gives 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but I need to check if 400 is included. Yes, because 400 is the first page with a hundreds digit of 4, and 488 is the last. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place gives 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks has 10 eights in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1 to 488, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40 eights. Now, wait, is there a 480-489 block? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 would be part of that. But since we're considering the tens place, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 more eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 4 blocks, but actually, the 480-488 is another block, so it's 5 blocks? Wait, no, because 480-489 would be the fifth block, but since we only go up to 488, it's only 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 4 full blocks (80-89, etc.) contributing 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, fours are 188, eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours first. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? Let's see: 484 / 10 = 48.4, but since we start at 4, the count is 49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place. Correct. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, totaling 49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Total: 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400 to 488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Total: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. So, perhaps the correct count is 49. Let me confirm: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, but since we include both 4 and 484, it's 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 numbers where the tens digit is 4. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 only in numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so units digit 8 occurs at 8, 18, ..., 488. How many? Let's see: from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, which would mean 49 occurrences, but wait, does 488 count as the 49th? Let's check: 8,18,28,...,488. The first is 8 (1st), then 18 (2nd), ..., 488 is the (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1= 48+1=49th occurrence. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers except the last one, which has 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. Let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, let me add them again: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 10+10=20, +10=30, +10=40, +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Hmm, maybe my initial approach was wrong. Let me think again. The number of times a digit appears in the units place up to N can be calculated by (N // 10) + 1 if the units digit is >= the target digit. Wait, maybe I should use a formula. The formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is floor((N + 1) / 10). So for N=488, the number of 4's in the units place is floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48. Similarly, for 8's in the units place, it's floor(489/10) = 48. Wait, that seems conflicting with my earlier thought. Let me test with a smaller number. Suppose N=14. How many 4's in the units place? 4,14 => 2 times. Using the formula: floor((14 +1)/10)=floor(15/10)=1, which is incorrect. So maybe the formula isn't exactly that. Alternatively, perhaps it's (N // 10) + (1 if N % 10 >= d else 0). Let's test that. For N=14, d=4: 14//10=1, 14%10=4 >=4, so total=1+1=2, which is correct. For N=488, d=4: 488//10=48, 488%10=8 >=4, so total=48+1=49. Similarly, for 8's: 488//10=48, 488%10=8 >=8, so total=48+1=49. Wait, that means both 4's and 8's in the units place occur 49 times? But that can't be right because 8 appears less frequently. Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think differently. For the units place, the number of times 4 appears is the number of complete groups of 10, plus one if the last digit is 4 or higher. So, for 488 pages, the units digit cycles every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10 (since 48*10=480), and then 8 more pages (481-488). In each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (e.g., 4,14,24,...). So, 48 groups give 48 fours. Now, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once more (484). So total 4's in units place: 48 +1=49. Similarly, for 8's in units place: each group of 10 has one 8 (8,18,28,...). 48 groups give 48 eights. In the remaining 8 pages, 488 is the last page, so units digit is 8, which is another occurrence. So total 8's in units place: 48 +1=49. Wait, so both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place? That seems odd because 8 is a higher digit, but in this case, since the last page is 488, which ends with an 8, it adds one more. So, yes, both have 49 in units place. Now, moving on to the tens place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 can appear in the tens place as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Similarly, 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is the range for 8 in the tens place. Let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each hundred has a 40-49 block, which is 10 numbers. So, from 1-488, how many hundreds? 488 is in the 400-488 range. So, 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50 fours. Now, for 8's in the tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page). So, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, total 8's in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, total 8's in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. So, 4's in tens place:50, 8's in tens place:49. Now, moving on to the hundreds place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1=89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, and 800-899 would be beyond that. So, 8's in hundreds place:0. Now, let's sum up all the occurrences. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total 4's=49+50+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total 8's=49+49=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. Units place: 4's=49, 8's=49. Tens place: 4's=50, 8's=49. Hundreds place: 4's=89, 8's=0. So, 4's total=49+50+89=188. 8's total=49+49+0=98. Difference=188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check again, maybe I made a mistake in counting the tens place for 4's. Wait, for the tens place, each hundred block (0-99,100-199, etc.) has a 40-49 block, which is 10 numbers. So, from 1-488, how many complete hundreds? 400-488 is part of the 400s. So, the 40-49 blocks are in 0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is not a complete hundred. So, in the hundreds place, 4's are from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, as I had before. But in the tens place, for 4's, it's 40-49 in each hundred. So, from 0-99:40-49:10, 100-199:140-149:10, 200-299:240-249:10, 300-399:340-349:10, 400-488:440-449:10 (since 440-449 is within 400-488). Wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. That seems correct. For 8's in the tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4 full blocks and one partial. So, 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. So, total 4's=49(units)+50(tens)+89(hundreds)=188. Total 8's=49(units)+49(tens)=98. Difference=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10, contributing 48 fours. The remaining 8 pages (481-488) include another 4 (484), totaling 49 fours.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks (including 440-449 in the 400s), each contributing 10 fours, totaling 50 fours.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, contributing 89 fours.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10, contributing 48 eights. The remaining 8 pages include another 8 (488), totaling 49 eights.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full blocks, each contributing 10 eights, and the partial block 480-488 contributes 9 eights, totaling 49 eights.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I should think of it as (488 \u00f7 10) rounded up to the next whole number if the last digit is 4 or more. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, which would mean 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digit goes up to 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484. So, from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Okay, so 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many times that happens. For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 times. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, but each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct: 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count each:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers)\n\nSo, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nNow, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 8's. Let me recount that. In the tens place, the 8's occur in:\n\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488)\n\nSo, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, it's 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449.

    "text": " Therefore, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's valid. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens from page 400 to 488. Each of these page numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let's see: 8, 18, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's count each block: From 1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers). So, that's 4 blocks with 10 each and 1 block with 9. So, total 4*10 +9=49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place from page 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, the total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think differently. For each set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, the 48th set ends at 480, and then we have 481-488, which is 8 more numbers. In 481-488, the units digit 4 appears at 484, so that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is fully included. Yes, because 449 < 488. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. Each of these numbers has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, total 4's = units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me add that again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times? Similar to 4's, but let's check. The first occurrence is at 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so does that add one more? Let's see: 488 is the last page. So, in the units place, 8 appears at 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Wait, that's different from my initial thought. Let me confirm: the sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488. Solving for n: 10(n-1) = 480 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 80-89 is one range. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but in the tens place, 480-488 has 8 in the tens place for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but each of the previous ranges had 10 numbers. So, let's break it down:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 49, but let me check. Each of the first four ranges contributes 10, and the last contributes 9. So 4\u00d710=40 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total 98 8's. Now, the number of 4's was 188. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, when I counted the 4's in the units place, I got 49, and in the tens place 50, and hundreds 89, total 188. For 8's, units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. So, 188 -98=90. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of each digit position separately for both 4 and 8 and ensure I haven't double-counted or missed any.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? As before, it's every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d710=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, 5 ranges. So, 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. As before, 49 times.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four ranges is 10 numbers, and the last is 9 numbers. So, 10\u00d74=40 +9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 800-899, but since the book only goes to 488, none. So, 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I feel like that might be correct, but let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using the formula for digit counting.\n\nFor any digit d in a number, the count can be calculated by considering each digit position separately.\n\nFor a number with n digits, the count of digit d in each position can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor the units place: (higher digits) \u00d7 10^0 \u00d7 (if d is 0, subtract 1 else 0) + something. Wait, maybe it's better to use a standard formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the formula where for each digit position, the number of times a digit d appears is:\n\nhigher = number formed by digits higher than current position\ncurrent = current digit\nlower = number formed by digits lower than current position\n\nThen, for each position:\n\nif current > d: count += (higher + 1) \u00d7 10^lower_digits\nif current == d: count += higher \u00d7 10^lower_digits + (lower +1)\nif current < d: count += higher \u00d7 10^lower_digits\n\nBut maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, since the book is only 488 pages, maybe it's easier to count manually as I did before.\n\nWait, but let me try applying this formula for 4's and 8's in each position.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's:\n\n1. Units place (position 0):\n\nWe can think of numbers from 000 to 488, but since we're dealing with actual page numbers starting at 1, maybe it's better to adjust.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to consider numbers from 000 to 488, which are three-digit numbers, and then subtract the count from 000 to 000, which is just 0.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me stick to my initial method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of each position separately.\n\nWait, maybe I should check my initial counts again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think: in the tens place for 4's, I counted 5 ranges: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50.\n\nIn the tens place for 8's, I had 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 5 ranges, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49.\n\nWait, so in the tens place, 4's have 50, 8's have 49. Similarly, units place both have 49. Hundreds place, 4's have 89, 8's have 0.\n\nSo, 4's:49+50+89=188\n\n8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range. Let's count how many sets of ten there are with 4 in the tens place. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? Let's see: the first is 8, the last is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 0, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in the tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

    "text": " So, in the units place, there are 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one block, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another block, another 10 numbers. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's a total of 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 5 blocks * 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but wait a second. The last block is 440-449, but our book goes up to 488. So, 440-449 is entirely within 488, so that's fine. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. That's 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, let me add up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count the blocks: From 1-99: 80-89 is one block (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 is another block (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 is another block (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 is another block (10 numbers). Now, from 400-488: The next block would be 480-489, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. Wait, but I'm only considering the tens place. So, in the hundreds place, 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, for the tens place, we have 4 full blocks (each contributing 10 eights) and one partial block contributing 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188 and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book only goes up to 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, no, actually, 484 is the 49th number because starting from 4 (which is the 1st), each 10 numbers add another. So, 484 is 484/10 = 48.4, but since we're counting inclusive, it's 49. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated by (N // 10) + 1 if the units digit is >=4. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, for each full set of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which adds another 4. So total units place 4's are 48 +1 =49. Okay, so units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? From 40-49: that's one range, 140-149: another, and so on up to 440-449. How many hundreds are there? 400-449 is within 488, so that's the fifth range (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). So, 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, but let me check again. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 4's. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. Then, in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included, adding another 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range contributes 10 numbers. How many such ranges are there? From 80-89:1, 180-189:2, 280-289:3, 380-389:4. The next would be 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, that's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four ranges are full, each contributing 10, and the last one contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm wondering if I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For 8's, in the tens place, I considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 380-389, which is four full ranges, each contributing 10, and then 480-488 contributing 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That seems right. Units place: 49, tens:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but let me think again about the units place for 4's. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The nth term is 10n-6. Wait, no, the nth term is 10(n-1)+4. So, when does 10(n-1)+4 <=488? 10(n-1)+4 <=488 => 10(n-1)<=484 => n-1<=48.4 => n<=49.4, so n=49. So, 49 times. That matches my earlier count. Similarly, for 8's in units place, it's 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 10*49 -2? Wait, 10*49=490, so 490-2=488. So, the nth term is 10(n-1)+8. 10(n-1)+8 <=488 => 10(n-1)<=480 => n-1<=48 => n=49. So, 49 times. That's correct. For the tens place of 4's: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each contributes 10, and how many such ranges? 40-49:1, 140-149:2, 240-249:3, 340-349:4, 440-449:5. So, 5 ranges, each 10, so 50. That's correct. For 8's in tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. Wait, earlier I thought only up to 380-389, but actually, 480-488 is also a range where 8 is in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 5 ranges, with the last one having 9. So, total 4*10 +9=49. So, that's correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds for 8's, totaling 98. So, 4's are 188, 8's are 98, difference is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems a big difference. Let me think if I double-counted somewhere. For example, in the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For 8's, since the book only goes up to 488, there's no 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 there. So, I think my counts are correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, no, because 484 is the 49th term when starting from 4. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate it as floor division. Let me think: The number of times a digit appears in the units place up to N is given by (N // 10) + 1 if the units digit is >= the target digit. Wait, no, that's for specific digits. Actually, for the units place, it's every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete decades (488 // 10 = 48) plus 1 if the last digit is 4 or higher. Since 488 ends with 8, which is higher than 4, so we add 1 more, making it 49. Wait, but 488 is 48 full decades (1-480) and then 481-488. So, in each decade, the units digit cycles 0-9, so each digit appears exactly once per decade. Therefore, in 48 full decades, 4 appears 48 times in the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once more in 484. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens place, 4 can appear in the tens digit, such as 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449, and maybe 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. Wait, so how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's break it down. Each hundred has a block where the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So from 1-99, that's one block: 40-49, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199, another block: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10. 300-399: 340-349, 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, and then from 450-488, the tens digit isn't 4 anymore. Wait, no, 440-449 is correct, and then 480-488 is another set where the tens digit is 8, so 4's in the tens place only go up to 449. So, how many blocks? From 1-399, we have 4 blocks (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So that's 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is another 10. So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but let me check: 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, for the hundreds place, 4 appears in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, we're only counting the digit 4 in the hundreds place. Each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So total 4's in hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, but let's check. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So from 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Each full decade (e.g., 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 8 in the units place. There are 48 full decades in 488 pages (since 488 // 10 = 48), and then 8 more numbers (481-488). In each full decade, 8 appears once, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once more (at 488). So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers except possibly the last one. Let's count: From 1-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, 10. From 200-299: 280-289, 10. From 300-399: 380-389, 10. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers? Let me check: 480 is the first, then 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 10 times in each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.), and 9 times in the last block (480-488). So total tens place 8's: (4 * 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, checking the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49. That seems correct because every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place, and the last partial decade adds one more.\n\n- Tens place: 50. Each hundred block contributes 10, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 5*10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 89. From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nNow for the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49. Correct, same logic as 4's.\n\n- Tens place: 49. Because in each of the first four hundreds, 80-89, etc., contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct, since the book doesn't go beyond 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades (1-480) contributing 48 occurrences. The remaining numbers (481-488) add one more (484), totaling 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks (including 440-449), each contributing 10, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The first four blocks contribute 40, and 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Hmm, maybe my initial thought was wrong. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place can be calculated by taking the total number of pages, which is 488, dividing by 10 to get 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But then, since 488 is not a multiple of 10, there are 8 more numbers beyond 480. In these 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's one range. Then 140-149: another. 240-249: another. 340-349: another. 440-449: another. That's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place 48 + tens place 50 + hundreds place 89 = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, checking each digit position: 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it does. So, how many such numbers? Let's see: 8,18,...,488. The first is 8, the last is 488. To find how many terms, we can compute (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's see how many ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: units place 49 + tens place 49 + hundreds place 0 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 fours. Additionally, 484 adds another 4 in the units place, making it 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 fours, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. The sequence ends at 488, giving 49 eights.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 eights each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book has only 488 pages.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Hmm, so maybe I should calculate it as (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Yes, that makes sense. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers) From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers) From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers) From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers) Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 numbers. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 count? Yes. So, how many numbers are there? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's see each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 numbers - 280-289: 10 numbers - 380-389: 10 numbers - 480-488: This is 9 numbers because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9, so 4*10 +9 =40 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's) =90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10 terms, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 terms.\n   \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 terms each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear here since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
