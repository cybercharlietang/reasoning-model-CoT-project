    "text": " So, units place contributes 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count each block: - 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 fours in the tens place. - 140-149: another 10 fours. - 240-249: another 10 fours. - 340-349: another 10 fours. - 440-449: another 10 fours. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but the last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 400-488 inclusive is 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. So, units place contributes 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 eights. - 180-189: another 10 eights. - 280-289: another 10 eights. - 380-389: another 10 eights. So that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, totaling 40 eights. Wait, but 480-489 would be another block, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of this. So, in the tens place, we have 40 eights from the full blocks and then from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Each of these has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 more eights. So, total eights in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place contributes 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3, or 4. 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract 98 from 188: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Total occurrences: 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4 \u2192 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.  \n   - Total blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488.  \n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.  \n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Total occurrences: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - Each full block (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 occurrences.  \n   - Total from full blocks: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.  \n   - Partial block (480-488): 9 numbers (480-488).  \n   - Total occurrences: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but does 440-449 fit within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: Units (49) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, because 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, so in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, total tens place occurrences: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, so 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but 400-488 is the fifth block, but only 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, units place gives 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups and then 8 in 488. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one more. So, units place gives 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488). So, 4 ranges with 10 each and 1 range with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? The blocks are 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is not a full block. So, let's see: From 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. Now, from 400-488: 440-449 is 10 numbers, and then 450-488 doesn't have a 4 in the tens place. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, from 400-488, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, total in the tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers, which is correct. So, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. So, 49 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Each full block contributes 10 numbers. Let's count how many full blocks there are: 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 = 9). So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, so 4*10=40, and the last block contributes 9. So, total in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: 1-99: 40-49 is one block, contributing 10 fours. 100-199: 140-149, another 10 fours. 200-299: 240-249, another 10 fours. 300-399: 340-349, another 10 fours. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 fours. Wait, but 488 is less than 499, so 440-449 is within 400-488. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers.

I'll follow the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the 49th multiple of 10. So, 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. So, units place contributes 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389.

So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens place in 400-488 contributes 9 eights. Wait, but 480 is part of 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for all these, so 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (from 1-399) and 1 block of 9 (from 400-488). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but since the book has only 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks of 10 (40-49, 140-149, etc.), totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, giving 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, etc.), totaling 49 occurrences (including 480-488).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there? From 1-488, we have four blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. Wait, 401-488 is the fifth block, but it's only up to 488. So, let's see: 40-49 is in the first block, 140-149 in the second, 240-249 in the third, 340-349 in the fourth, and 440-449 in the fifth. But 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, that's 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. Wait, but the fifth block is only up to 488, so does 440-449 include 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, all five blocks are complete. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4's appear 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. How many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But let's check: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, we have four blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. In each of the first four blocks, the 8 in the tens place occurs in 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the fifth block, 401-488, does the tens place ever have an 8? The tens place goes from 0 to 8 in 401-488. Wait, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of this. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, in the tens place, 8 occurs 9 times in this block. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8's appear 98 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. That's 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total: 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I have a feeling I might have overcounted the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check that again. The hundreds place for 4's is from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct because 488-400+1=89. So, that's correct. For the tens place of 8's, I had 4 blocks with 10 each, which is 40, and then in 401-488, the tens place 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. That seems correct. Units place for both 4 and 8 is 49 each, which makes sense because the last occurrence is 484 for 4 and 488 for 8, both being the 49th occurrence. So, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 140-149 (10) From 200-299: 240-249 (10) From 300-399: 340-349 (10) From 400-488: 440-449 (10) Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440 is 440, 441, ..., 449. So yes, 10 numbers. So total 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me check that addition: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Okay, so 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, let's see how many blocks: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 180-189 (10) From 200-299: 280-289 (10) From 300-399: 380-389 (10) From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the hundreds place, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40, and the last block contributes 9 numbers. So total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Wait, let me check: units is 49, tens is 49, so 49 + 49 is 98. Okay, so 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers. Wait, let me just double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. That seems correct.

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another range. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, the last range is 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 488 is the last page. 449 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, tens place contributes 50 4's. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. Each number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so integer part is 48, but including 488, that's 49 numbers. So, units place contributes 49 8's. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range has 10 numbers. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is one range. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: 480-489. Wait, but 480-489 is within 400-488? 489 is beyond 488, so the last number is 488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many full ranges do we have? The first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 numbers, contributing 4*10=40 8's. Then, in the 400-488 range, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 8's. Now, adding up all the 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

Wait, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99, plus 89 (hundreds) = 188. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups of 10, which would give 48 occurrences. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 8. Wait, no: 8 is the first, 18 the second, ..., 488 is the 49th. So, units place has 49 8's. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many such ranges exist up to 488. - 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n\nWait, 480-489 would be the next, but since the book only goes up to 488, the range 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Then, the partial range 480-488 contributes 9 8's in the tens place (since 480 has an 8 in the tens, 481, etc., up to 488). So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 8's. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counting because 90 seems high. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me go through the 4's again. Units place: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488. How many numbers? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. Now, 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. How many? (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer would be 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me make sure I didn't double-count any numbers. For example, in the hundreds place, 440-449: those numbers have 4 in hundreds and tens place, but each digit is counted separately, so that's fine. Similarly, 480-488: 480 has 4 in hundreds and 8 in tens, but each digit is counted separately. So, no overlap issues. So, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit '4' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). \n     - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n     - Number of ranges: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n     - Each range contributes 10 numbers, so total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.\n     - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of '8's:**\n   - **Units place:** The digit '8' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n     - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n     - Full ranges: 4 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n     - Partial range 480-488 contributes 9 occurrences.\n     - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n     - Number of occurrences: 0.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let me calculate how many full ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. From 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, the book only goes up to 488. So, the last range is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but we take the integer part, which is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, 8 occurs in the units place 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. So, how many ranges? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, total in tens place: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4, 14, ..., 484. This results in 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, giving 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8, 18, ..., 488.

Each of these blocks has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10. So, 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. That's 484 /10 = 48.4, but since 484 is included, it's 49 numbers. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place. From 0-99: 40-49 (10). 100-199:140-149 (10). 200-299:240-249 (10). 300-399:340-349 (10). 400-488:440-449 (10). So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, the last occurrence is 488. How many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89,180-189,...,480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Each block from 0-99:80-89 (10), 100-199:180-189 (10), 200-299:280-289 (10), 300-399:380-389 (10), 400-488:480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, for the first four blocks (0-399), each contributes 10. The last block (400-488) contributes 9. So, total tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90.

    "text": " So, units place: 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 40-49, that's 10 fours. Then 140-149, another 10, and so on up to 440-449. Let me count the blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, the last block is 440-449. Does 449 fall within the 488-page limit? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's fine. So, tens place: 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, hundreds place: 89 fours. Now, let me add up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of fours is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so 8 appears in the units place at 488. So, starting from 8, 18, ..., 488. How many numbers? Let's calculate: The first is 8, which is the 8th number, and the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count the blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each with 10 eights. So, 4 * 10 = 40 eights in the tens place. But wait, does 380-389 fall within 488? Yes, because 389 is less than 488. So, that's fine. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, total number of eights is 89. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 89 eights = 99. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. For eights: units: 49, tens: 40, hundreds: 0. 49 + 40 = 89. So, 188 - 89 = 99. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in counting the units place for fours. Let me check again. Units place for fours: from 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. How many numbers is that? The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1 = floor(484/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, that's correct. Similarly, for eights in units place: from 8, 18, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers as well. So, that's correct. Tens place for fours: 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each with 10 fours, so 50. That's correct. Tens place for eights: 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each with 10 eights, so 40. Correct. Hundreds place for fours: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. Hundreds place for eights: none, since 800 is beyond 488. So, total fours: 188, total eights: 89. So, the difference is 188 - 89 = 99. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be different. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. And in the tens place, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Units place, 49. So, 188 fours. For eights, units place: 49, tens place: 40, so 89. So, 188 - 89 = 99.

Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, 40-49 is the first block, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, that's 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, but 488 is included, so that's 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds another. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). Let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, total blocks: 4 full blocks (each 10) and one partial block (9). So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4, 14, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, units place contributes 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1 to 488, the blocks are: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in each of these, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but wait a minute. The hundreds place can only be 4 in the numbers 400-499, but our book only goes up to 488, so it's 400-488. So, the count is 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Let's count the number of 8's in each place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488. So, units place contributes 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. So, how many blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. The first four blocks each contribute 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range. Let me count how many sets of 100 there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. From 200-299: 240-249 is another 10. From 300-399: 340-349 is another 10. From 400-488: 440-449 is another 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, it's valid. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the 49th multiple of 10 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but including 0, it's 49 times). Wait, but 488 is 488, so the units digit is 8, so yes, it's included. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many sets: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers because 480 is the first, 488 is the ninth). Wait, no: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80s, 180s, 280s, 380s) and one set of 9. So, total is 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. For the 4's: units place: 4,14,...,484: that's 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, so 49 times. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449: 5 sets, each 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 49 times. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488: 4 sets of 10 (80s, 180s, 280s, 380s) which is 40, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49. So, 49+49=98. Difference: 188-98=90. Hmm, but I think I might have overcounted somewhere. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, each of those has a 4 in the hundreds place, correct. For the tens place of 4's, 40-49 is 10, then 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Since 440-449 is within 488, that's correct. So 5 sets, 50. Units place for 4's: 4,14,...,484. 484 is the 49th term because 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10 => n = (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's, units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th term because 488-8=480, 480/10=48, so 48+1=49. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, units place contributes 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then, 140-149: another 10, and so on up to 440-449. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 starting from page 400 to 488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, let me add up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the 49th multiple of 10 after 0. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place contributes 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is included, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Wait, no, 480-489 would be a full block, but since we only go up to 488, the last block is 480-488. So, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. The fifth block, 480-488, has 9 numbers. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89: 10 eights in the tens place. 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. Then, 480-488: 9 eights. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place contributes 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are: - 40-49: 10 numbers - 140-149: 10 numbers - 240-249: 10 numbers - 340-349: 10 numbers - 440-449: 10 numbers. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. Total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place, plus the last number 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, it's included. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these ranges: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 numbers - 280-289: 10 numbers - 380-389: 10 numbers. But wait, does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since the book only goes up to 488, the range is 480-488. So, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's an additional 9 numbers. So, total tens place: 4 ranges with 10 each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: Units: 49, Tens: 49, Hundreds: 0. Total 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences where 4 is in the tens place. So, from 1-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks of 10 numbers each, totaling 50 occurrences. So, tens place gives 50 occurrences of 4. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, adding up all the occurrences of 4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but let's check: 8, 18, ..., 488. The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 8. So, units place gives 49 occurrences of 8. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me calculate each block: - 1-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. - 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. - 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. - 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. - 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers (since 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers). Wait, no, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place occurrences: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place gives 49 occurrences of 8. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place gives 0 occurrences of 8. Adding up all the occurrences of 8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, units place contributes 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place only in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many terms? The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The difference between each term is 10, so the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place contributes 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me check if 480-489 is within the book's pages. Since the book has 488 pages, 480-488 is valid, but only up to 488. So, for the tens place: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 numbers instead of 10. So, for the tens place, we have 4 ranges with 10 eights each, and one range with 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book has 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98.

Each of these blocks has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, so that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. Each page number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is included, so let's calculate how many. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 8 occurs at 8, 18, ..., 488. The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 times. But wait, 380-389 is within 488, so that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, 89 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 89 = 99. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 40, hundreds 0. 49 + 40 = 89. So, 188 - 89 = 99. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check if I counted correctly for the tens and units places. For 4's in the units place: from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. For 8's: units place: 8, 18, ..., 488. (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, yes, the difference is 188 - 89 = 99.

Each of these blocks has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. 100-199: 140-149 is another. 200-299: 240-249. 300-399: 340-349. 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, so 5*10=50. But wait, the last block is 440-449, but our book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is fully included. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but our book stops at 488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The last occurrence is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is the 49th occurrence, we have 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, how many blocks? From 0-99: 80-89 is one block (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers). So, that's 4 blocks with 10 each and one block with 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. So, starting from 4, each 10 numbers. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 0-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:10. Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit being 4 is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 sets, each contributing 10. So, 50 fours in tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in 8,18,28,..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number with 8 in units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? Starting from 8, each 10 numbers. So, 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. So, let's check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189:10. - 280-289:10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 is the first, then 481,482,...,488). So, total in tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check if I made a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. So, 188 -98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count these ranges: - 40-49: that's 10 numbers. - 140-149: another 10. - 240-249: another 10. - 340-349: another 10. - 440-449: another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, in the hundreds place, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So that's 89 times. So, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, the last occurrence of 8 in the units place is 488. Let's calculate how many times that happens. Starting from 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, let's count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers. So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49 (1st set), 140-149 (2nd), 240-249 (3rd), 340-349 (4th), and 440-449 (5th). But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so all 5 sets are valid. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the counts for each place: Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. Total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 1 to 488, the number of 4's in units place is floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1 = (484/10) +1 = 48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in tens place. There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), but actually, from 0-488, it's 5 sets: 0-99 (40-49), 100-199 (140-149), 200-299 (240-249), 300-399 (340-349), and 400-488 (440-449). So, 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 89. Total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, breaking it down by units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389:10. 480-488: 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total 8's=49+49=98. Now, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's)=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check the counts. For 4's: Units:49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total 188. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, especially in the tens place for 8's, I might have made a mistake. Let me recount the tens place for 8's. The sets are: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. So, 49 in tens place. Units place: 8,18,...,488. Let me check how many: From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. So, 49 in units. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's:98. Therefore, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Now, let's see how many such ranges are there. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up the counts for 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188.

The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488).

So, total tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up the counts for 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total 8's: 98.

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there?

So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, the last range is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the 8th digit in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is 488, so the units digit is 8, so yes, it's the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many ranges: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers) From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers) From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers) From 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last page). So, how many numbers in each range: 10, 10, 10, 10, and 9. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, same for 180-189, etc., but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total is 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9, so 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that's 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to miscount. Let me recount the 4's: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.

No, because 440-449 is within 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place only in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that?

So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. How many such blocks are there? From 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Wait, but 480-489 would be another block, but since the book only goes up to 488, the block 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 40 times, and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more times. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, no. Wait, 480-488 is the tens digit as 8, right? Because 480 has tens digit 8, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks *10 =40, plus 9, so 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me go through the 4's again. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many? The formula is (last - first)/step +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, each with 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, 49+50+89=188. Now for 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's 9 more, but actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480 is the first, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 more in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks *10=40, plus 9=49. So, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:188-98=90. Wait, but let me check if 480-488 is correctly accounted for. Since 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, that's correct. So, total tens place 8's:49. So, total 8's:49+49=98. Therefore, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 terms, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. This range includes 89 terms.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 40 terms, and 480-488 adds 9 more, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, units place gives 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 1-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 300-399: 340-349, and 400-488: 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50 fours. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's correct. So, tens place gives 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, hundreds place gives 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 10(n-1)+4. So, 10(n-1)+4 = 484. So, 10(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: Each block of 100 has 10 fours in the tens place, as 40-49, 140-149, etc. From 1-488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, that's 5 blocks, but the last block is only up to 488. But in the tens place, the 4 can be in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many terms. The last term is 488, which is 8*61=488? Wait, 8*61=488? Let me check: 8*60=480, so 8*61=488. So, the units place has 61 occurrences of 8. Wait, but 488 is the 61st term because starting from 8, each step is +10. So, 8,18,28,...,488. So, number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier thought. Wait, 488 is 8 + 10*(n-1). So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, units place gives 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which contributes 9 eights (from 480-488). Wait, let me think. From 1-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is 10. From 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10, which is 40, plus 9 from the last partial block, totaling 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought units place had 49 eights, tens place had 49, so total 98 eights. Now, the number of fours was 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. But wait, let me double-check the counts because I might have made a mistake. Let's go through the eights again. Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. As calculated, 49 eights. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40+9=49. So, total eights: 49+49=98. Fours were 188, so 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because when I first thought about units place for eights, I considered 488 as the last term, which is correct, giving 49 eights. Similarly, for fours, the hundreds place had 89 fours, which seems correct because 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the number of fours and eights in each digit place again to make sure. For fours: Units place: 4,14,...,484. As before, 49 fours. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block is 10 fours, so 5 blocks *10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. For eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. 49 eights. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks *10=40, plus 9=49. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total eights: 49+49=98. So, difference: 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems consistent. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place for every set of 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these sets has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such sets there are. The first set is 40-49, which is in the 1st hundred (1-100). Then 140-149 in the second hundred, 240-249 in the third, 340-349 in the fourth, and 440-449 in the fifth hundred. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. There are 5 hundreds in total (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500), but since the book ends at 488, the last hundred is 401-488, which is incomplete. But for the tens place, the 4 can only be in the tens digit, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, and there are 5 hundreds, so 5*10=50. Wait, but let me check: from 1-100, 40-49 is 10 numbers. 101-200, 140-149 is another 10. 201-300, 240-249 is another 10. 301-400, 340-349 is another 10. 401-488, 440-449 is another 10. So that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. I'll go through each digit position again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers is that? (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these sets has 10 numbers, except possibly the last one if it's cut off. Let's check each hundred: - 1-100: 80-89 is 10 numbers. - 101-200: 180-189 is another 10. - 201-300: 280-289 is another 10. - 301-400: 380-389 is another 10. - 401-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, how many 8's in the tens place here? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, for the first four hundreds, each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the fifth hundred contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place. The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, units place gives 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, hundreds place gives 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in numbers ending with 8, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. If I divide 488 by 10, I get 48.8, so there are 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th number ending with 8. So, units place gives 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). Now, 400-488 doesn't have a 480-489 range because the book ends at 488. So, from 400-488, the tens place 8 would be in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but in the tens place, each 80-89 block is 10 numbers, but here, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 489 isn't included. So, does that affect the count? Let me think: The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, how does that affect the count? Let me recast: The tens place 8 occurs in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So that's 5 ranges, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, the first four ranges each contribute 10 eights, and the last contributes 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

    "text": " So, units place contributes 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such ranges are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. Each number here has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is 488, which is the 8th digit in the units place. Wait, actually, 488 is the last page, so how many 8's in the units place? Let's compute: The first 8 is at 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. To find how many, we can take the highest number that ends with 8 less than or equal to 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the number of times 8 appears in the units place is 49 (since 488 is the 49th occurrence). Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place, so 488 is the 49th. So, units place contributes 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Now, let's check if 480-489 is within our range. Since the book only goes up to 488, the range 480-489 would only go up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, how many full ranges do we have? 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. But wait, the 480-489 range isn't fully included because we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place (480-488). So, we have 4 full ranges (80-89, etc.) and one partial range (480-488). So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 eights, so that's 4*10=40. Then, the next range would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more eights in the tens place. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Wait, in the tens place, I think I made a mistake. Let me recount the tens place. The ranges where 8 appears in the tens place are: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 ranges. Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 eights, so 4*10=40. The fifth range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, contributing 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. So, units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. Total eights: 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 98, but let me confirm. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcounting. Let me think differently. For the tens place, each time the tens digit is 8, it contributes 10 eights, except for the last partial range. So, up to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, 8 in tens place: 10 eights.\n- 180-189: 10 eights.\n- 280-289: 10 eights.\n- 380-389: 10 eights.\n- 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 eights.\n\nSo, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. So, yes, 49. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place was 49 and tens place was 49, so 98 total. But when I calculated fours, I had 188. So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nLet me recount the fours:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units place.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in hundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, eights:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. So, ((488-8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: No eights, since the book ends at 488, which is less than 800.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit '4' appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges, each contributing 10 '4's, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit '4' appears in numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit '8' appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last range being 480-488 (9 numbers). This totals 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers in the 800s, so no '8's here.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:** 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of '4's printed exceeds the number of '8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? The highest number is 488, so the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, the last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times. The last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 occurrences. Now, let's see how many such blocks are there up to 488. The blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. The next block would be 480-489, but since our book ends at 488, we have only 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, each block except the last one contributes 10, and the last contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: (4 blocks \u00d7 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, no, actually, let me correct that. The blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 blocks. The first four blocks are complete, each contributing 10, and the fifth block contributes 9. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. So, tens place: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, yes, that seems correct.

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then, 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. However, I need to check if 440-449 is within 488. Since 449 is less than 488, that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part gives 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count the ranges: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. That's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40. Now, does 480-489 exist? Since the book has 488 pages, 480-488 is part of the range. So, does 480-489 count as another range? Well, 480-489 would be another 10 numbers, but since the book only goes up to 488, the tens digit 8 in 480-488 is still 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, that's 9 more. So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges \u00d710=40, plus 9=49. Wait, that seems off. Let me think again. The hundreds digit in 480-488 is 4, and the tens digit is 8. So, 480 is the first, then 481, ..., up to 488. That's 9 numbers (since 488-480+1=9). So, in the tens place, we have 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial range of 9 numbers (480-488). So, total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=49+49=98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - There are 49 such numbers (from 4 to 484 inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - There are 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - There are 89 such numbers.\n\n**Total 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - There are 49 such numbers.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - There are 4 full ranges (40 numbers) and 9 numbers in the partial range 480-488, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book only goes up to 488.\n\n**Total 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.**\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 488. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place only in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers contributes a 4. So, there are 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-488. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have 4 full blocks (each giving 10 8's) and one partial block giving 9 8's. So, total 8's in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

    "text": " So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, let's see how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, all 5 blocks are valid. Therefore, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, let me add up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let me count the number of such blocks. The first block is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189 (another 10), 280-289 (another 10), 380-389 (another 10). That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 8's. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 8's in the tens place. Wait, but does 380-389 fall within 488? Yes, because 389 is less than 488. So, all 4 blocks are valid. Therefore, 40 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with an 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, there are 89 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 89 = 99. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought there might be a mistake. Let me double-check my calculations. Wait, when I counted the units place for 4's, I had 49, and for 8's, also 49. Then tens place: 50 for 4's and 40 for 8's. Hundreds place: 89 for 4's and 0 for 8's. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Total 8's: 49 + 40 + 0 = 89. So, 188 - 89 = 99. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but I thought maybe the hundreds place for 4's was 89, but that seems high. Let me check: from 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. So, the difference is 188 - 89 = 99. Therefore, there are 99 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - There are 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - There are 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - There are 89 numbers, each contributing one 4: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - There are 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 380-389.\n   - There are 4 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in any page number since the book ends at 488.\n   - 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 40 + 0 = 89.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 99.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 99.\n\n\\boxed{99}"

    "text": " So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is okay, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, but 480-488 is still within the book. Wait, but for the tens place, let me think. The tens digit is 4 in the range 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. But wait, does 440-449 exist? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8*49=488? Wait, no. Wait, each occurrence is every 10 numbers, so from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? Let me think differently. The first 8 is at 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The number of terms can be found by (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let me count each set. - 80-89: 10 numbers (80-89) - 180-189: another 10 - 280-289: another 10 - 380-389: another 10 - 480-488: here, the tens digit is 8, but the numbers go up to 488. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, each of the first four sets contributes 10, and the last set contributes 9. So total is 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (1st Digit):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449. Let's count how many sets there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. From 200-299: 240-249 is another 10. From 300-399: 340-349 is another 10. From 400-488: 440-449 is another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're counting occurrences, it's 49 times (from 8 to 488). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 488 count as one? Yes, because 488 is page number 488, so the units digit is 8. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count these. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is another 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is another 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, the tens place counts are: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers in the hundreds place with 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the difference is number of 4's minus number of 8's: 188 - 98 = 90.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449. Let me count how many full tens places there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. From 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, all 5 sets are within 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400 to 488. Let's see, from 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Yes, because 488 is the 49th number where the units digit is 8. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within the book. Since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 are included. So, how many sets? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 full sets of 10, and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me double-check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, yes, 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 is 90, but let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake. Let me recount the fours: units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. Eights: units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds: 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check the tens place for eights again. When I considered the tens place, I included 480-488 as 9 numbers, but does that affect the count? Let me see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 49. So, 98 total. Fours:188. So, 188-98=90.

Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4. Let's break it down: - 1-99: The tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 4's. - 100-199: Similarly, 140-149, another 10 4's. - 200-299: 240-249, another 10 4's. - 300-399: 340-349, another 10 4's. - 400-488: Here, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 449 is within 488, so yes, 10 numbers. So, adding these up: 10 (from 1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers add one. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups of 10, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. Let's set that equal to 488: 8 + 10(n-1) = 488 \u2192 10(n-1) = 480 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 8. Let's calculate: - 1-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. - 100-199: 180-189, another 10. - 200-299: 280-289, another 10. - 300-399: 380-389, another 10. - 400-488: 480-488. Here, the tens digit is 8, so numbers are 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in this case, it's 9 instead of 10. So, adding up: 10 (1-99) +10 (100-199)+10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+9 (400-488) = 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the hundreds digit is 8. But the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. When counting the tens digit as 4, I considered 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 5 blocks each contributing 10, so 50. Yes, that's correct. For the 8's in the tens place, I had 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 49. That seems correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

The last block contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, units place contributes 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such blocks there are. The book goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're dealing with the tens place, let's consider each hundred block. - For the first 100 pages (1-100): The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. - For the next 100 (101-200): 140-149, another 10. - Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Okay, that's the total number of 4's. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place contributes 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Let's see how many such blocks there are up to 488. - 1-100: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. - 101-200: 180-189, another 10. - 201-300: 280-289, another 10. - 301-400: 380-389, another 10. - 401-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be the next block, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, instead of 10, we have 9 eights in the tens place for the 401-488 block. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one block of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in the following ranges: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 800, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Wait, that can't be right because 4's were 188 and 8's are 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the eights. Let me recount the tens place for 8's. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, and the last block has 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. That's correct. Units place: 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. So, total eights: 49 + 49 = 98. Now, for fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly for fours. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. That's correct because 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, that seems right. Okay, so the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.
