Let me think again. For the hundreds place in 4's: from 400 to 488, inclusive. 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct.

For example, in the tens place, when I count 440-449, does that include 444, which has two 4's? But when counting digits, each occurrence is counted separately, so 444 would have two 4's, but in the tens place count, I'm only counting the tens digit, which is 4 in 440-449, so that's correct. Similarly, in the units place, 444 would have a 4 in the units place, which is counted in the units place count. So, each digit is counted separately, so no double-counting issues.

Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all page numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nAdding these together, the total number of 4's is 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. This results in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges each contribute 10 occurrences, and the last range contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8, so this contributes 0.\n\nAdding these together, the total number of 8's is 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\nThe number of 4's exceeds the number of 8's by 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Wait, but I thought the answer might be 90, but let me check if I counted correctly. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right. 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes. So, 188 fours and 98 eights, so 90 more fours. Hmm, but wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting digits, especially in different positions, it's easy to miscount. Let me try another approach for the units place. For units place, how many times does 4 appear? From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, and then in the 49th cycle, we have 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 fours in units place. Similarly, for 8's in units place, same logic: 488/10=48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, and then 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in units place. That matches what I had before. Now, for the tens place: 4's. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers). 101-200:140-149 (10). 201-300:240-249 (10). 301-400:340-349 (10). 401-488:440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. Correct. For 8's in the tens place: Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. Correct. So, 50 fours in tens place and 49 eights in tens place. So, 50-49=1 more four in tens place. Wait, but overall, the difference is 90. Let me see: fours total 188, eights total 98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me check if I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. 400-488: that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. So, 89 fours there. Now, for 8's, hundreds place: none, so 0. So, 89 fours in hundreds place, 0 eights. So, that's a difference of 89 in hundreds place alone. Then, in tens place, 50 fours vs 49 eights, so +1. In units place, 49 fours vs 49 eights, so 0. So, total difference is 89+1=90. Yep, that adds up. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers.

Hmm, so the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me think again. When I counted the units place for 4's, I included 484, which is correct. For the tens place, I included 440-449, which is correct. For hundreds, 400-488 is correct. For 8's, units place up to 488, so 488 is included, correct. Tens place up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, correct. So, yes, 90 seems right. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to miscount, especially when the upper limit isn't a multiple of 10. Let me try another approach to verify. For 4's: - Units: floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 has a units digit of 8, which is less than 4, we don't add 1. Wait, no, actually, when counting how many times a digit appears in the units place, it's (n + 9) // 10. Wait, maybe I should use a formula. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor((n + 1) / 10). So, for 4's in units place: floor((488 +1)/10)= floor(489/10)=48. But wait, that's 48, but earlier I thought it was 49. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, let me think. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? The first is 4, then 14, 24,...,484. The last one is 484, which is 484=4 + 10*(k-1). So, 484=4 +10(k-1) => 480=10(k-1) => k-1=48 => k=49. So, 49 numbers. But the formula floor((488 +1)/10)=48. So, which is correct? Wait, 488 +1 is 489, divided by 10 is 48.9, floor is 48. But we have 49 numbers. So, maybe the formula is different. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is floor((n - d)/10) +1. Let me check. For d=4, n=488. So, (488 -4)/10=484/10=48.4, floor is 48, plus 1=49. So, that works. So, the correct count is 49. So, my initial count was correct. Similarly, for 8's in units place: floor((488 -8)/10) +1= (480)/10=48 +1=49. Correct. So, that's consistent. Similarly, for tens place, the formula is a bit more complex, but I think my initial counting was correct. So, 4's:188, 8's:98, difference 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10, except 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
