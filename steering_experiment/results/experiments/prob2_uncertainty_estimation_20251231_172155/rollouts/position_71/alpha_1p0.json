Wait, but I feel like maybe I missed something. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this by considering each digit place separately and making sure I didn't double-count or miss any numbers. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a formula to count the number of times a digit appears in each position. For a given digit d in position p (units, tens, hundreds), the count can be calculated as follows. Let me try to formalize this. For the units place: The number of times a digit d appears is equal to the number of complete groups of 10, plus the remainder if the digit is less than the current digit. Wait, maybe I should use the standard digit counting method. The formula for counting the number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is: count = (N // 10) * (10 // 10) + min(max(N % 10 - d + 1, 0), 10). Wait, perhaps it's better to use the standard approach where for each position, you calculate higher, current, and lower digits. Let me try that. For the units place: For digit 4, how many times does it appear? The number of complete tens is 488 // 10 =48. Each complete ten contributes 1 occurrence of 4 in the units place. So 48 *1=48. Then, the remainder is 488 %10=8. Since 8 >=4, we add 1 more (for the 4 in 484). So total units place 4's:48+1=49. Correct. Similarly, for digit 8 in units place: 488//10=48, so 48 occurrences. Remainder is 8, which is equal to 8, so add 1. So 48+1=49. Correct. Now, for the tens place: For digit 4, the number of times it appears in the tens place. The higher part is 488 // 100=4. Each higher part contributes 10 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So 4 *10=40. Now, the current digit is 4 in the tens place, so we look at the remainder. The current number is 488, so the last two digits are 88. Since the current digit is 4, and the remainder is 88, which is greater than or equal to 4*10=40, but less than 50, so we add (88 -40 +1)=49? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, for the tens place, each time the tens digit cycles through 0-9 every 100 numbers. So, for digit 4 in the tens place, it's 10 numbers every 100. So, for 488 pages, there are 4 full hundreds (0-399), each contributing 10 occurrences, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens place 4's:40+10=50. Correct. Similarly, for digit 8 in the tens place: higher part is 488//100=4, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total tens place 8's:40+9=49. Correct. For the hundreds place: For digit 4, it's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 occurrences. For digit 8, there are no numbers from 800-899, so 0. So, total 4's:49 (units)+50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188. Total 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98. So, 188-98=90.

So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because in the tens place for 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, that's correct. So, yes, 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, the answer should be 90. But let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. Maybe I can think of another way to count. Alternatively, I can count the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10)=48, but since 488 is included, it's 49. Wait, no, that formula might not be accurate. Alternatively, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to n is floor(n/10) + (1 if the units digit >=d else 0). Wait, but for digit 4, up to 488, the number of 4's in units place is floor(488/10) +1 if 488's units digit >=4. 488's units digit is 8, which is >=4, so it's 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place, the number of times 4 appears is calculated as follows: for each hundred, there's a block where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. So, for 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so the tens digit cycles through 0-9. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10. Then, in the hundreds before 400, like 100-399, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 100-199: 140-149 (10), 200-299:240-249 (10), 300-399:340-349 (10). So, that's 3 sets of 10, which is 30, plus 10 in 440-449, making 40. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 50. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, when I counted 40-49 as 10, 140-149 as 10, 240-249 as 10, 340-349 as 10, and 440-449 as 10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. But now, using this method, I'm getting 40. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, 40-49 is in the 1-99 range, right? So, that's 10. Then 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. So, I think my initial count was correct at 50. So, perhaps the alternative method I was considering was wrong because it didn't include the 40-49 set. So, I think the correct count is 50 for the tens place. So, 50 fours in the tens place. So, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49, as before.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9).

So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (Ones Place):** The digit '4' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). The sequence starts at 4 and ends at 484. To find the count:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = \\frac{480}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n     So, there are 49 '4's in the units place.\n   \n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges:\n     \\[\n     5 \\times 10 = 50\n     \\]\n     So, there are 50 '4's in the tens place.\n   \n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. The count is:\n     \\[\n     488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n     \\]\n     So, there are 89 '4's in the hundreds place.\n   \n   - **Total '4's:** Adding them up:\n     \\[\n     49 (\\text{units}) + 50 (\\text{tens}) + 89 (\\text{hundreds}) = 188\n     \\]\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place (Ones Place):** The digit '8' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). The sequence starts at 8 and ends at 488:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = \\frac{480}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n     So, there are 49 '8's in the units place.\n   \n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 numbers, and the last range contributes 9 numbers:\n     \\[\n     4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\n     \\]\n     So, there are 49 '8's in the tens place.\n   \n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '8' does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488, and the hundreds digit would be '8' only in pages 800-899, which are beyond 488.\n     \\[\n     0\n     \\]\n   \n   - **Total '8's:** Adding them up:\n     \\[\n     49 (\\text{units}) + 49 (\\text{tens}) + 0 (\\text{hundreds}) = 98\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's:\n     \\[\n     188 - 98 = 90\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"
