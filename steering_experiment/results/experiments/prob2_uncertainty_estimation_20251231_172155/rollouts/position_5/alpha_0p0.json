    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the difference. That makes sense. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 more numbers. Each set contributes one 4, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit is 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers every hundred. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many such sets are there? Well, in 488 pages, there are four hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, actually, that's five sets, but the last one only goes up to 488. So, for each hundred, except the last one, the tens digit 4 appears exactly 10 times. So, for the first four hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), that's 4 times 10, which is 40. Now, in the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449. Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, etc., but wait, no, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, right? Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the tens digit is 4 in the range 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's another 10. So total tens place 4's would be 40 (from the first four hundreds) plus 10, totaling 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's correct. So total 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but hold on, in the first hundred, 0-99, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. So up to 300-399, that's 4 sets, each contributing 10, so 40. Then in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's 40 + 10 = 50. Okay, that seems right.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, contributing 89 4's.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the tens place. Let me recount the tens place. \n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times. So, from 0-99, 40-49: 10 times. From 100-199, 140-149: 10. From 200-299, 240-249: 10. From 300-399, 340-349: 10. That's 4 sets, 40 times. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: Each ten numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the last 8 numbers (481-488) don't include a 4 in the units place. So, 48 units place 4's.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 hundreds place 4's.\n\nSo, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 4's. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, in every ten numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many 8's in units place? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once more (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, in 0-99, 80-89: 10. In 100-199, 180-189: 10. In 200-299, 280-289: 10. In 300-399, 380-389: 10. That's 4 sets, 40 times. Now, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, from 480 to 488. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98 8's.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the tens place again. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. So, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 times 8 in the tens place. So, 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, no, wait. Units place is 49, tens place is 49, so total 98. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For units place, 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 8 appears once at 488. So, 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10, so 4 hundreds contribute 40, plus in 400-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 40+9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 187 - 98: 187 - 100 is 87, so plus 2 is 89. Yes, correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't overcount the 4's. Let me recount the 4's.\n\nUnits place: 48.\n\nTens place: 50.\n\nHundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. Correct.\n\nAnd 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Because 400-488 is 89 numbers, but the hundreds digit is 4 in all of them, so that's 89 4's. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the 8's count. Because in the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus 1 in 488, so 49. Correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to miscount. Let me try a different approach to verify.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place: As before, 48.\n\nTens place: 50.\n\nHundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal: 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nTens place: 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal: 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\n\nNumber of 4's in each place:\n\nUnits: floor(488/10) = 48, plus if the last digit is >=4, but since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so add 1 if the digit is >=4. Wait, no, that's for counting how many times a digit appears in a specific position. Wait, perhaps a better way is to calculate for each digit position.\n\nWait, maybe I should use a formula for counting digit occurrences.\n\nThe formula for counting the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is:\n\nunits = (n // 10) * 1 + min(max(n % 10 - d + 1, 0), 10)\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, for units digit, the number of times d appears is (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0).\n\nWait, let's test this with n=488 and d=4.\n\nUnits place 4's: (488 // 10) = 48, and since 488 % 10 =8 >=4, so add 1. So, 48 +1=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, so now I'm confused.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, when counting the number of 4's in the units place from 1 to 488, it's actually 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48, and then in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once at 484. So, 48 +1=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, so which is correct?\n\nWait, let me list the numbers ending with 4 up to 488: 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms are there? The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 4's in the units place. Wait, so earlier I thought it was 48, but it's actually 49. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, so let me correct that. So, units place 4's: 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: numbers ending with 8 up to 488: 8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488, which is included. So, number of terms: ((488 -8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. Correct.\n\nSo, I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought units place 4's were 48. It's actually 49. So, that changes things.\n\nWait, so let's redo the counts with this correction.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nTens place: Let's recalculate.\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n\nFrom 0-99: 10 numbers.\n\nFrom 100-199: 10 numbers.\n\nFrom 200-299:10 numbers.\n\nFrom 300-399:10 numbers.\n\nFrom 400-488: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 4*10 +10=50.\n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 50 in total.\n\nSo, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nWait, 49+50=99, plus 89=188.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 187, but that was because I had units as 48, which was wrong. So, now it's 188.\n\nWait, let me confirm again.\n\nUnits place 4's: 49.\n\nTens place 4's:50.\n\nHundreds place 4's:89.\n\nTotal:49+50=99+89=188.\n\nNow, number of 8's:\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nTens place: Let's recalculate.\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers.\n\nFrom 0-99:10.\n\nFrom 100-199:10.\n\nFrom 200-299:10.\n\nFrom 300-399:10.\n\nFrom 400-488: the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive).\n\nSo, tens place 8's:4*10 +9=49.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49)=98.\n\nSo, difference:188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89, but now it's 90. Hmm.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake in the initial count of units place 4's, which affected the total. So, the correct total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: numbers ending with 4 up to 488: 4,14,24,...,484. The count is ((484 -4)/10)+1=48+1=49.\n\nTens place: in each hundred, 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. So, 4 sets of 10, that's 40, plus in 400-488, 440-449, which is 10, so total 50.\n\nHundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nTens place: in each hundred, 10 numbers where tens digit is 8, so 4*10=40, plus in 400-488, 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so total 49.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89, but that was because I had units place 4's as 48, which was incorrect. So, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check once more to be sure.\n\nAnother way: For each digit position, count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nUnits digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10)=48, plus if the last digit is >=4, which it is (8>=4), so add 1. So, 48+1=49.\n\nNumber of 8's: floor(488/10)=48, plus if last digit >=8, which it is (8=8), so add 1. So, 48+1=49.\n\nTens digit:\n\nFor 4's: floor(488/100)=4, which gives the number of complete hundreds. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, the remaining part is 488%100=88. So, in the tens place, how many 4's are there in 0-88? The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, add 10. So, total tens place 4's:40+10=50.\n\nFor 8's: floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. Remaining part is 88, so in the tens place, how many 8's? From 80-88, which is 9 numbers. So, add 9. So, total tens place 8's:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds digit:\n\nFor 4's: floor(488/1000)=0, but since 488 >=400, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's.\n\nFor 8's: hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, which is beyond 488, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: units(49)+tens(50)+hundreds(89)=188.\n\nTotal 8's: units(49)+tens(49)+hundreds(0)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the number of 8's. \n\nTo solve this, we count the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 occurrences. Additionally, 484 ends with 4, adding 1 more. Total: 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 40-49). There are 4 full hundreds (0-399), contributing 40 occurrences. In 400-488, 440-449 adds 10 more. Total: 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full sets of 10, contributing 48 occurrences. Additionally, 488 ends with 8, adding 1 more. Total: 49.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 80-89). There are 4 full hundreds, contributing 40 occurrences. In 400-488, 480-488 adds 9 more. Total: 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place within 1-488. Total: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, then find the difference between the two counts. That sounds like a plan. Let me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I think it's easier to count the occurrences of each digit in each position and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the digit 4. Let's first look at the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, etc. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. Each complete set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Plus, in the last partial set (481-488), the number 484 has a 4 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. Here, the digit 4 appears in a block of 10 numbers. For example, 40-49 have 4 in the tens place. Each such block contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, starting from 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, from 1-100, there's one block (40-49). From 101-200, another block (140-149), and so on. How many hundreds are there? 488 is in the 4th hundred (1-400), and then 401-488 is the fifth hundred but not complete. Wait, no, actually, 488 is 4 hundreds (1-400) plus 88 pages. So, from 1-400, how many blocks of 40-49, 140-149, etc., are there? Each hundred has one such block, so 4 hundreds would have 4 blocks, each contributing 10 4's. That's 4*10=40. Then, in the 401-488 range, we have another block starting at 440-449, which is 10 more 4's. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 1-400, each hundred has one block of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 4 blocks, 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the next block would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10. So, 40 +10=50. That seems right.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences of the digit 4.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 +50=99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 +50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place again. For every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, similar to 4, from 1-488, how many 8's in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus in the last partial set (481-488), the number 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place. The digit 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, for example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such block contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 8. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488?\n\nFrom 1-400, each hundred has one block: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the next block would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many 8's in the tens place here? Each number from 480-488 has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 occurrences. So, total in the tens place: 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1-400, 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, from 401-488, the block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 8's in the tens place. So, 40 +9=49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, the hundreds place doesn't have any 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, yes, 0.\n\nSo, total 4's are 188 and total 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in 481-488, 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place, so +1, total 49.\n\nTens place: From 1-400, 4 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10, so 40. Then, 440-449 is another block in 401-488, contributing 10, so 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, 488 has an 8, so +1, total 49.\n\nTens place: From 1-400, 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10, so 40. Then, 480-488 is another partial block, contributing 9, so total 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 90 seems like a big difference. Let me see if I counted correctly.\n\nAnother way to check is to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: floor(488/10)=48, plus if the last number is >= (48*10 +4), which is 484, so 484 is included, so +1, total 49.\n\n- Tens: floor(488/100)=4, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), how many tens digits are 4? From 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so +10, total 50.\n\n- Hundreds: floor((488 - 100 +1)/100)=4, but wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488 >=48*10 +8=488, so +1, total 49.\n\n- Tens: floor(488/100)=4, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so +9, total 49.\n\n- Hundreds: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think about another approach. Maybe using the formula for digit counting.\n\nFor a given digit d, the number of times it appears in each position can be calculated as follows.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of times d appears = (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0), but actually, more accurately, it's (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0) if d !=0, but since we're dealing with digits, d can be 0-9.\n\nWait, perhaps a better formula is:\n\nFor each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the count is calculated as:\n\nhigher = number formed by digits higher than the current position\ncurrent = current digit\nlower = number formed by digits lower than the current position\n\ncount = higher * 10^power\n\nif current > d: count += 10^power\nif current == d: count += lower +1\n\nBut this might be more complicated. Let me try applying this formula for 4 and 8 in each position.\n\nLet's start with 4's.\n\nUnits place (power=0):\n\nFor units digit, the formula is:\n\nhigher = 488 // 10 = 48\ncurrent = 488 % 10 = 8\nlower = 0\n\nSo, count_units_4 = higher *1 + (if current >4, add 1, else 0). Since current is 8>4, so count_units_4=48*1 +1=49.\n\nTens place (power=1):\n\nhigher = 488 // 100 =4\ncurrent = (488 //10) %10=8\nlower = 488 %10=8\n\ncount_tens_4 = higher *10 + (if current >4, add 10, else if current ==4, add lower +1). Here, current=8>4, so count_tens_4=4*10 +10=50.\n\nHundreds place (power=2):\n\nhigher = 488 // 1000=0\ncurrent=(488//100)%10=4\nlower=488%100=88\n\ncount_hundreds_4= higher*100 + (if current>4, add 100, else if current==4, add lower +1). Here, current=4, so count_hundreds_4=0*100 + (lower +1)=88 +1=89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly for 8's.\n\nUnits place:\n\nhigher=488//10=48\ncurrent=8\nlower=0\n\ncount_units_8= higher*1 + (if current >=8, add 1). Since current=8, which is equal, so count_units_8=48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nhigher=488//100=4\ncurrent=(488//10)%10=8\nlower=488%10=8\n\ncount_tens_8= higher*10 + (if current >8, add 10, else if current==8, add lower +1). Here, current=8, so count_tens_8=4*10 + (8+1)=40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nhigher=488//1000=0\ncurrent=(488//100)%10=4\nlower=488%100=88\n\ncount_hundreds_8= higher*100 + (if current>8, add 100, else if current==8, add lower +1). Here, current=4<8, so no addition. So, count_hundreds_8=0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, same result as before. Therefore, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit surprised because I thought maybe the difference would be smaller, but according to the calculations, it's 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nLet me try a smaller example to see if the method works. Suppose a book with 20 pages. How many more 1's are there than 2's?\n\nPage numbers:1-20.\n\nCount of 1's:\n\nUnits: 1,11 \u2192 2\nTens: 10-19 \u219210\nTotal 1's:12\n\nCount of 2's:\n\nUnits:2,12 \u21922\nTens:20 \u21921\nTotal 2's:3\n\nDifference:12-3=9.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nFor 1's:\n\nUnits:20//10=2, current=0, so 2 + (if 0>=1? No) \u21922\nWait, maybe the formula is better for digits 0-9. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, using the method above:\n\nUnits place for 1:\n\nhigher=20//10=2\ncurrent=20%10=0\ncount_units_1= higher + (if current >=1, add 1 else 0). Since current=0<1, so count_units_1=2.\n\nTens place:\n\nhigher=20//100=0\ncurrent=(20//10)%10=2\nlower=20%10=0\n\ncount_tens_1= higher*10 + (if current>1, add 10, else if current==1, add lower +1). Here, current=2>1, so count_tens_1=0 +10=10.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 1's:2+10=12.\n\nFor 2's:\n\nUnits:\n\nhigher=20//10=2\ncurrent=0\ncount_units_2=2 + (if 0>=2? No) \u21922.\n\nTens:\n\nhigher=20//100=0\ncurrent=(20//10)%10=2\nlower=20%10=0\n\ncount_tens_2= higher*10 + (if current>2, add 10, else if current==2, add lower +1). Here, current=2, so count_tens_2=0 + (0 +1)=1.\n\nHundreds:0.\n\nTotal 2's:2+1=3.\n\nDifference:12-3=9, which matches the manual count. So, the method works.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the difference is indeed 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full group, the 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear there. So, units place gives me 48 fours.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a block of ten numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block has 10 fours, so that's 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but does 440-449 count? Since the book only goes up to 488, yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nAdding up all the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the fours, every group of ten numbers has one 8 in the units place. From 1-488, there are 48 full groups of ten and 8 extra numbers. So, 48 eights from the units place. Plus, in the extra numbers 481-488, the units digit includes 8, so that's one more. So, total units place eights: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Each full block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, and the last block contributes 9. Let's count how many full blocks there are. 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four blocks, each with 10 eights, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, the last block 480-488 has 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, so no eights there.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. So, 98 eights in total.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off because when I counted the units place for 8's, I added 48 (from the full groups) plus 1 from the extra 8 in 488, making it 49. For the tens place, I had 4 full blocks (each contributing 10) and then 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. So, 49 + 49 = 98 eights.\n\nSo, the number of fours is 187 and the number of eights is 98. To find how many more fours there are, subtract 98 from 187: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor eights:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the tens place for fours. The blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nFor eights, units place: 48 full groups (each contributing one 8) plus one more in 488, so 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, that's five blocks, right? Because 80-89 is one, 180-189 is two, 280-289 is three, 380-389 is four, and 480-488 is five. So, that's five blocks. But the first four blocks are full (10 numbers each), contributing 4*10=40. The fifth block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nSo, the counts seem accurate. Therefore, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\nTo solve this, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full groups of 10 (480 numbers) and 8 extra numbers (481-488). Thus, 48 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full groups and one extra in 488, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full blocks (40 occurrences) and 9 in 480-488, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear here.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** There are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times 8 appears, and then find the difference between these two counts. Let me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each digit position one by one for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4. Let's first look at the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). In those extra 8 pages, the units digit is 4 in 484, so that's one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place for the digit 4. In the tens place, 4 appears in a block of 10 numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there up to page 488? Let's see, the first block is 40-49, which is 10 pages. Then, 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 4's, so that's 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check: from 0-99, there's 40-49 (10), then 100-199: 140-149 (10), 200-299: 240-249 (10), 300-399: 340-349 (10), and 400-488: 440-449 (10). So that's five blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place for the digit 4. The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. \n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. Starting with the units place. Just like with 4, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many groups of 10 are there? 48 full groups (480 pages) and then 8 extra pages (481-488). In each group, one 8, so 48 times. In the extra 8 pages, the units digit is 8 in 488, so that's one more. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place for 8. Similar to 4, the tens digit is 8 in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 pages (480 to 488 inclusive). Each full block contributes 10 8's, but the last block only contributes 9. So, how many full blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's four full blocks and one partial. Each full block gives 10 8's, so 4*10=40, and the partial gives 9. So total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 1 to 488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 4 full blocks and one partial. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place for 8. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems off because when I calculated units and tens for 8, I got 49 each, so 98 total. But let me double-check the tens place calculation because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake there.\n\nSo, for the tens digit being 8, each block is 10 numbers. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers). So that's 4 full blocks and one partial. So, 4*10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place for 8 was 49, which is correct because 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8, and then in 481-488, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more, making 49.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when counting, especially in the hundreds place, it's easy to make a mistake. For 4's in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's there.\n\nFor 8's in the hundreds place, as we saw, none because the book only goes up to 488, so hundreds digits go up to 4. So, 0 8's there.\n\nWait, but let me make sure about the tens place for 8. So, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, right? So, 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the 4's count, I had 49 in units, 50 in tens, and 89 in hundreds, totaling 188. For 8's, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, totaling 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me check the units place for 4 again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms are there? Let's see, the first term is 4, the last is 484. The sequence is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times, which matches what I had before.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in units place, from 8,18,...,488. Let's see, the last term is 488. 8 + 10*(n-1)=488. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n=49. So, 49 times, which is correct.\n\nIn the tens place for 4, we had 5 blocks: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place for 8, we had 4 full blocks (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and one partial block (480-488). Each full block is 10, so 4*10=40, and the partial block is 9, so total 49. Correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 doesn't appear at all. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the units and tens places, I considered all numbers up to 488, but does that include any overlaps or double-counting? I don't think so because each digit position is considered separately. So, for example, in the number 444, the 4's in the units, tens, and hundreds places are each counted once. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother thing to check: when I calculated the hundreds place for 4, I considered 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the hundreds place, since the book doesn't go beyond 488, there are none, which is correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked all the steps, so I'm confident that the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** Every 10 numbers, '4' appears once. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades (480 numbers) and 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full decade, '4' appears once in the units place, contributing 48 times. In the extra 8 numbers, '4' appears once (484). Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** '4' appears in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 5 such blocks up to 488, each contributing 10 '4's. Total: 5 * 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** '4' appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to '4', '8' appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades and 8 extra numbers. In each full decade, '8' appears once, contributing 48 times. In the extra 8 numbers, '8' appears once (488). Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** '8' appears in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 full blocks and one partial block (480-488). Each full block contributes 10 '8's, and the partial block contributes 9. Total: (4 * 10) + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** '8' does not appear in any hundreds place since the book ends at 488. Total: 0.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the approach here is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit position one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in the units place, a 4 appears once every 10 numbers. Now, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups and a partial group of 8 numbers. So, in each complete group, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so there's another 4 in 484. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you have 488 pages, the units digit cycles 48 full times (each 10 pages) and then an extra 8 pages. So, in each 10 pages, the units digit is 4 once. So, 48 times, plus in the last 8 pages, does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, 484 ends with a 4, so that's one more. So, 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 4's in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each set of 100 numbers, the tens digit is 4 for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many full hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). In each full hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages, so that's 4 times 10 = 40. Now, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449, which is 10 pages, but wait, 488 is only up to 488, so 440-449 is within 401-488. So, that's another 10. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but wait, 401-488: 440-449 is 10 numbers, so yes, that's 10. So, total 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 99 + 89 is 188? Let me check: 99 + 80 is 179, plus 9 is 188. Yes, that's correct. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4's, in every 10 numbers, the units digit is 8 once. So, in 488 pages, how many complete groups of 10? 48 groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last partial group is 481-488, which has 8 in the units place at 488. So, that's one more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the last 88 pages. So, each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, in 1-100, 80-89 is 10 numbers. Similarly, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: each is 10 numbers. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Now, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9). Wait, 480, 481, ..., 488: that's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 40 + 9 = 49 8's.\n\nWait, but wait, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 from the full hundreds and 9 from the last partial hundred, totaling 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), 484 has a 4 in units place, so +1, total 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred contributes 10, so 4 hundreds (1-400) gives 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so +10, total 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Last partial group: 488, so +1, total 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred contributes 10, so 4 hundreds (1-400) gives 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so +9, total 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** \n     - In every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n     - There are 48 complete groups of 10 in 488, contributing 48 fours.\n     - The last partial group (481-488) includes 484, adding 1 more.\n     - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   \n   - **Tens Place:** \n     - In every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).\n     - There are 4 complete hundreds (1-400), contributing 4\u00d710 = 40 fours.\n     - In 401-488, 440-449 adds another 10.\n     - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   \n   - **Hundreds Place:** \n     - From 400-488, 4 appears in the hundreds place for 89 numbers.\n     - Total: 89.\n\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** \n     - Similar to 4, 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n     - 48 complete groups contribute 48 eights.\n     - The last partial group (481-488) includes 488, adding 1.\n     - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   \n   - **Tens Place:** \n     - In every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89).\n     - 4 complete hundreds contribute 4\u00d710 = 40 eights.\n     - In 401-488, 480-488 adds 9 eights (since 480-488 is 9 numbers).\n     - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   \n   - **Hundreds Place:** \n     - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n     - Total: 0.\n\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. Let me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each place for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's. \n\nStarting with the units place: In every set of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 full sets of 10 and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times from the full sets, and then in the extra 8 pages, 481-488, the units digit is 1-8, so no additional 4's. So total 4's in units place: 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: Here, the digit 4 appears in a block of 10 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each of the 4 full hundreds, there are 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's another 10 occurrences. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 +10=50.\n\nWait, let me check that. From 401-488, the tens digit is 0 in 401-410, 1 in 411-420, ..., 8 in 481-490. But since we only go up to 488, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. But the tens digit is 8 in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the tens place from 401-488, the digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So yes, 10 more. So total 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these 89 numbers, contributing 89 4's.\n\nWait, let me confirm. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nSo, total number of 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 +50=98, 98+89=187.\n\nWait, 48+50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, in each set of 10, the units digit 8 appears once. So, how many full sets of 10 are there in 488? 48 full sets, so 48 occurrences. Then, the extra 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1-8, so 8 appears once in 488. So total units place 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in blocks of 10. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block of 100 has 10 occurrences. So, in 488 pages, how many full hundreds? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0-8. So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here. So total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, let me check. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 -480 +1=9. So, 9 occurrences. So, 40+9=49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, 49+49=98. So, 98 8's.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits: 48 (since 488/10=48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1, and the last 8 pages don't add any more 4's in units place). So, 48.\n\nTens: Each hundred has 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. Total 50.\n\nHundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 48+50+89=187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits: 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digit is 8 in 488, so 1 more. Total 49.\n\nTens: Each hundred has 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. In the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. Total 49.\n\nHundreds: 0, as before.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 187 -98=89.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, from 401-488, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, correct.\n\nAnd for the units place, 488 is included in the 8's count, so that's correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 -98=89.\n\nWait, but I feel like that might be a bit high. Let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place: For each 10 numbers, 1 occurrence. So, total units place 4's: floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 is included, we have 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. But wait, 488/10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, and the last 8 numbers (481-488) don't add any more 4's in units place. So, 48.\n\nTens place: For each 100 numbers, there are 10 occurrences in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). So, 488/100=4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40+10=50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in hundreds place, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 48+50+89=187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: Each 10 numbers, 1 occurrence. So, 48 full tens, contributing 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), units digit 8 occurs once (488). So, 48+1=49.\n\nTens place: Each 100 numbers, 10 occurrences. So, 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:187-98=89.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I didn't double-count or miss any numbers.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider each digit place separately for both digits.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is less than 4, so no extra 4's. So, 48.\n\nNumber of 8's: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is exactly 8, so 48+1=49.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)=4, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, the remainder is 88, so in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. Total 50.\n\nNumber of 8's: floor(488/100)=4, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, the remainder is 88, so in the tens place, 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. Total 49.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/1000)=0, but since 488 is less than 1000, we check if hundreds digit is 4. 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nNumber of 8's: hundreds digit 8 would be 800-899, but since we only go up to 488, 0.\n\nSo, 4's: 48 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=187.\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:187-98=89.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** In every block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. There are 48 full blocks of 10 in 488, contributing 48 occurrences. The remaining 8 pages (481-488) don't add any more 4's in the units place.\n   - **Tens Place:** In every block of 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, then find the difference between the two counts. Let me start by counting the number of 4's first.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: These are from 1 to 9. The only single-digit number that has a 4 is 4 itself. So, that's one 4.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: These range from 10 to 99. Here, the digits can be in the tens place or the ones place. I should consider both positions separately.\n\nFor the tens place: The numbers would be 40-49. That's 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place. So, that's 10 4's.\n\nFor the ones place: The numbers would be 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, so I need to make sure I don't double count. Let me see, from 10-99, every ten numbers have a 4 in the ones place once. So, starting at 14, then 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the ones place. But wait, 44 has a 4 in both tens and ones place, so when I count the tens place earlier, I already counted that 4. So, when counting the ones place, I should still include 44's ones place 4, because it's a separate digit. So, that's 9 4's in the ones place.\n\nWait, but from 10 to 99, how many 4's are in the ones place? Let me think again. The ones digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each set of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the ones place. From 10 to 99, that's 9 sets of 10 (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99). So, 9 4's in the ones place. But wait, 40-49 is another set where the tens digit is 4, which we've already counted. So, in the ones place, it's 9 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens place) + 9 (ones place) = 19.\n\nWait, but 44 is included in both counts, but that's okay because each digit is counted separately. So, the total 4's in two-digit numbers are 19.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: These are from 100 to 488. So, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. The tens and ones digits can be 0-9, except for the last hundred, which only goes up to 88 (since 488 is the last page).\n\nLet me break this down by hundreds place.\n\nHundreds digit is 1: 100-199. Here, the hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's there. But I need to check the tens and ones digits.\n\nSimilarly, hundreds digit is 2: 200-299. Again, hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's there, but check tens and ones.\n\nHundreds digit is 3: 300-399. Same here, hundreds digit is 3, no 4's, but check tens and ones.\n\nHundreds digit is 4: 400-488. Here, hundreds digit is 4, so every number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. Let's count those first.\n\nFrom 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's right there.\n\nNow, I also need to count 4's in the tens and ones places within the three-digit numbers.\n\nStarting with hundreds digit 1 (100-199):\n\nTens place: The tens digit cycles from 0-9. For each hundred, the tens digit being 4 occurs once every 100 numbers. So, in 100-199, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's 10 times: 140-149. Each of these 10 numbers has a 4 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, ones place: For each hundred, the ones digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in 100-199, the ones digit is 4 in 104, 114, 124, 134, 144, 154, 164, 174, 184, 194. That's 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the ones place.\n\nSo, in 100-199, total 4's: 10 (tens) + 10 (ones) = 20.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digit 2 (200-299):\n\nTens place: 240-249, so 10 4's.\n\nOnes place: 204, 214, 224, 234, 244, 254, 264, 274, 284, 294. 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 10 + 10 = 20.\n\nSame for hundreds digit 3 (300-399):\n\nTens place: 340-349, 10 4's.\n\nOnes place: 304, 314, 324, 334, 344, 354, 364, 374, 384, 394. 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 10 + 10 = 20.\n\nNow, hundreds digit 4 (400-488):\n\nFirst, the hundreds place gives us 89 4's, as we calculated earlier.\n\nNow, let's count 4's in the tens and ones places within 400-488.\n\nStarting with tens place: The tens digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place. So, 10 4's.\n\nOnes place: The ones digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in 400-488, how many times does the ones digit equal 4? Let's see, from 400-488, the ones digit is 4 in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, 484 is within 488, so that's 9 numbers. Wait, but 404 to 484 in steps of 10: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the ones place.\n\nWait, but 484 is the ninth number because 404 is the first, and each step is 10, so 404 + 80 = 484. So, that's 9 numbers.\n\nWait, but let me check: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Yes, that's 9 numbers.\n\nSo, in the ones place, we have 9 4's.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 10 4's, and in the ones place, 9 4's.\n\nBut wait, in 440-449, the ones digit can also be 4, so 444 would be counted both in the tens and ones place. So, when I count the tens place, I include 440-449, which includes 444, and when I count the ones place, I include 404,414,...,484, which also includes 444. So, 444 is counted twice, but that's correct because it has two 4's. So, I don't need to adjust for that.\n\nSo, total 4's in 400-488:\n\nHundreds place: 89\n\nTens place: 10\n\nOnes place: 9\n\nTotal: 89 + 10 + 9 = 108.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that. From 400-488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, hundreds digit is 4 in all 89 numbers, contributing 89 4's.\n\nIn the tens place, as I said, 440-449 is 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place, so 10 4's.\n\nIn the ones place, from 400-488, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see, starting at 404, then 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's in 400-488: 89 + 10 + 9 = 108.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so does 488 have a 4 in the hundreds place? Yes, 4 in the hundreds, 8 in the tens, and 8 in the ones. So, yes, it's included in the 89 numbers.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers:\n\nFor hundreds digits 1,2,3: each contributes 20 4's, so 3*20 = 60.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: 108 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 60 + 108 = 168.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 168\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that addition again. 1 + 19 is 20, plus 168 is 188. So, total 4's printed: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's printed.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: The only single-digit number with an 8 is 8 itself. So, that's one 8.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: 10-99.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, 10 8's.\n\nOnes place: The ones digit is 8 in 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the ones place. Wait, but 88 has an 8 in both tens and ones place, but we're counting each digit separately, so it's okay to include both.\n\nSo, in the ones place, 9 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 19.\n\nNow, three-digit page numbers: 100-488.\n\nAgain, breaking it down by hundreds digit.\n\nHundreds digit is 1: 100-199.\n\nTens place: 180-189, so 10 8's.\n\nOnes place: 108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198. That's 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the ones place.\n\nSo, total 8's in 100-199: 10 + 10 = 20.\n\nSimilarly, hundreds digit is 2: 200-299.\n\nTens place: 280-289, 10 8's.\n\nOnes place: 208,218,228,238,248,258,268,278,288,298. 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\nTotal 8's: 10 + 10 = 20.\n\nHundreds digit is 3: 300-399.\n\nTens place: 380-389, 10 8's.\n\nOnes place: 308,318,328,338,348,358,368,378,388,398. 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\nTotal 8's: 10 + 10 = 20.\n\nHundreds digit is 4: 400-488.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Each of these has an 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 8's.\n\nOnes place: The ones digit is 8 in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Let's count these. Starting from 408, each step of 10 up to 488. So, 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the ones place.\n\nBut wait, 488 is included in both the tens and ones place counts. So, in the tens place, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. In the ones place, we have 9 numbers ending with 8, including 488.\n\nSo, total 8's in 400-488:\n\nTens place: 9\n\nOnes place: 9\n\nPlus, the hundreds digit: 4 in 400-488, but that's not an 8, so no contribution there.\n\nSo, total 8's in 400-488: 9 + 9 = 18.\n\nWait, but let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. And in the ones place, from 408 to 488, stepping by 10, that's 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 + 9 = 18.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n100-199:20\n\n200-299:20\n\n300-399:20\n\n400-488:18\n\nSo, total three-digit 8's: 20 + 20 + 20 + 18 = 78.\n\nAdding single-digit and two-digit: 1 + 19 = 20.\n\nTotal 8's: 20 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Single-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:78. 1+19=20, 20+78=98. So, total 8's:98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's:188, total 8's:98.\n\nDifference:188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit: tens place 40-49:10, ones place 14,24,...,94:9, total 19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n100-199: tens 140-149:10, ones 104,114,...,194:10, total 20.\n\n200-299: same, 20.\n\n300-399: same, 20.\n\n400-488: hundreds place 89, tens 440-449:10, ones 404,414,...,484:9. Total 89+10+9=108.\n\nSo, 20+20+20+108=168 in three-digit.\n\nTotal 4's:1+19+168=188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit: tens 80-89:10, ones 18,28,...,98:9, total 19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n100-199: tens 180-189:10, ones 108,118,...,198:10, total 20.\n\n200-299: same, 20.\n\n300-399: same, 20.\n\n400-488: tens 480-488:9, ones 408,418,...,488:9, total 18.\n\nSo, three-digit 8's:20+20+20+18=78.\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I double-counted somewhere. Let me check the three-digit 4's again.\n\nIn 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 in all 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTens place:440-449:10 4's.\n\nOnes place:404,414,...,484:9 4's.\n\nSo, 89+10+9=108. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in three-digit 8's, 400-488: tens 480-488:9, ones 408,...,488:9, so 18.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe using a different counting method.\n\nAnother approach is to consider each digit position separately.\n\nLet's count the number of 4's and 8's in the units, tens, and hundreds places across all page numbers.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, total number of units 4's: floor(488/10) = 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus if the last partial ten has a 4. The last number is 488, which is in the 48th ten (480-488). 480 has a 4 in units, 481 doesn't, etc., up to 488. So, in the 48th ten, 480 has a 4, 481-488 don't. So, total units 4's:48 +1=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I counted 188 4's. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in this alternative approach.\n\nWait, no, actually, the units digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, that's 48 full tens (1-480) and then 481-488, which is 8 more numbers. So, in the units place, 4 appears once per ten, so 48 times in the first 480 numbers, plus once in 484, so total 49 units 4's.\n\nSimilarly, tens place:\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears in blocks of 100, specifically in the 40-49 range in each hundred. So, from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn each hundred, 40-49 is 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. So, for hundreds 0-3 (i.e., 1-399), that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens 4's:40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, hundreds place:\n\n4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99 +89=188. Which matches my earlier count. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place:\n\n8 appears once every 10 numbers, so from 1-488, that's 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus in the last partial ten (481-488), 488 has an 8 in units place, so total units 8's:48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\n8 appears in the tens place in 80-89 in each hundred. So, from 1-488, how many times?\n\nIn hundreds 0-3 (1-399), that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nIn the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, tens 8's:40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n8 appears in the hundreds place only in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) =98.\n\nWhich matches my earlier count.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference between their counts.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 4 has a '4'.

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each position in the page number separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each of these 48 sets, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again in the units place here. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers in each hundred. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? Well, from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's five blocks. But wait, the last block (400-488) doesn't go up to 499, so I need to check if the tens place 4's are affected. \n\nIn the 400-488 range, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, so 40-49 in the 400s would be 440-449, which is a full set of ten. So, that's 10 more 4's. So, total 4's in the tens place would be 5 blocks times 10, which is 50. Wait, but let me double-check. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers), so 10 4's. Then 100-199: 140-149 (another 10). Similarly, 200-299: 240-249 (10). 300-399: 340-349 (10). And 400-488: 440-449 (10). So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 50 4's in the tens place. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, there are 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, I'll do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: In every set of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, similar to 4's, but let's check. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so that's another 8 in the units place (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers in each hundred. For example, 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. So, let's count how many such blocks there are.\n\nFrom 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers, so 10 8's). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), so the tens digit is 8 for all these, but only 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 4 blocks of 10 (each contributing 10 8's) and one block of 9 (contributing 9 8's). So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. Similarly, 100-199: 180-189, another 10. 200-299: 280-289, 10. 300-399: 380-389, 10. 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, each of the first four hundreds contributes 10 8's, and the last one contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but when I count 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480 to 488. So, that's 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus the last partial set from 481-488, which includes 488, so that's one more 8 in the units place, making it 49. Tens place: Each hundred up to 400 contributes 10 8's, except the last one which contributes 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, total 8's: 49 +49=98.\n\nWait, but let me check again for the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 48 times (for 8,18,...,478), and then 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, yes, 49 units place 8's.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, as calculated, 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 +49=98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 8's in the units place were 49 and in the tens place 49, so total 98.\n\nNow, for 4's, I had 187, and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 187 -98=89.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because 187-98=89. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: From 1 to 488, how many 4's in units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so no 4's. So, units place 4's:48.\n\nTens place: In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 0-99: 40-49 (10). 100-199:140-149 (10). 200-299:240-249 (10). 300-399:340-349 (10). 400-488:440-449 (10). So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. So, tens place 4's:50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488. How many numbers? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 4's:48+50+89=187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full sets (8,18,...,478) =48, plus 488, so 49.\n\nTens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four contributes 10, and the last contributes 9, so 4*10+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed any 8's in the hundreds place. Since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages numbered 800-899, so no 8's in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 89 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place.\n   - Total sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full sets, contributing 48 \u00d7 1 = 48.\n   - No additional 4's in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488).\n   - Total units place 4's: 48.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149).\n   - Number of hundreds: 5 (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - Each contributes 10, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - Total tens place 4's: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 8 in the units place.\n   - Total sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full sets, contributing 48 \u00d7 1 = 48.\n   - The last partial set (481-488) includes 488, adding one more.\n   - Total units place 8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189).\n   - Number of hundreds: 5 (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - The first four hundreds contribute 10 each: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - The last hundred (400-488) contributes 9 (480-488).\n   - Total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No pages numbered 800-899 exist in a 488-page book.\n   - Total hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such numbers are there up to 488? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers, so the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a digit, I think it's 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, maybe it's 49 times? Wait, no, because 488 ends with 88, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484, which is 48 times. So, units place: 48 times.\n\nNext, the tens place: For every 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so that's 4 times 10 = 40. Then, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total for tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but actually, in the hundreds place, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, that's 488 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, the last number is 488, which ends with 8, so does that mean the units digit 8 appears 49 times? Let me check: The first 8 is at 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? The number of terms in the sequence 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The difference between each term is 10, so the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place for 8: 49 times.\n\nNext, the tens place: For every 100 numbers, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers. So, from 1-100: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 101-200: 180-189, another 10. 201-300: 280-289, 10. 301-400: 380-389, 10. Then, 401-488: The tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, total tens place: 10 (from 1-100) + 10 (101-200) + 10 (201-300) + 10 (301-400) + 9 (401-488) = 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: From 1-400, there are four sets of 100, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place for 8 is 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place for 8: 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? So, that's correct.\n\nSo, now, number of 4's is 187, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits: 48 times.\n\nTens: 50 times.\n\nHundreds: 89 times.\n\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits: 49 times.\n\nTens: 49 times.\n\nHundreds: 0.\n\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for 8 again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? The numbers are 8,18,28,...,488. The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributes 10, and in the last part, 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 49 total. So, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place for 4, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I feel like that might be too high. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4 again. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, that's five sets of 10 numbers each, so 5*10=50. That's correct.\n\nUnits place for 4: 4,14,24,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, this is conflicting.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the units place for 4. The first number is 4, then 14, 24,..., up to 484. So, the last term is 484, which is 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10. So, solving for n: 484 = 4 + 10(n-1) \u2192 480 = 10(n-1) \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 times. So, earlier I thought it was 48, but actually it's 49.\n\nWait, that changes things. So, units place for 4 is 49, not 48.\n\nSimilarly, for 8, units place is 49. So, units place for 4 is 49.\n\nSo, correcting that, total number of 4's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:50\n\nHundreds:89\n\nTotal:49+50=99, +89=188.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:49\n\nHundreds:0\n\nTotal:98.\n\nDifference:188 - 98=90.\n\nWait, so I had a mistake in the units place for 4, it's actually 49, not 48. So, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, let me confirm again. For the units place of 4, numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times.\n\nSo, units place for 4:49\n\nTens place:50\n\nHundreds place:89\n\nTotal:49+50+89=188.\n\nUnits place for 8:49\n\nTens place:49\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place for 4 was 48, but that was wrong. It's 49. So, the initial mistake was in the units place for 4, which I corrected.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** Every 10 numbers, '4' appears once.

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times 8 appears, then subtract the two counts to find the difference. Let's start by counting the number of 4's. \n\nFor single-digit page numbers (1-9), the only number with a 4 is page 4. So that's 1 occurrence of the digit 4. \n\nNext, for two-digit page numbers (10-99), I need to consider both the tens place and the units place. \n\nIn the tens place, the digit 4 can appear in the numbers 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. \n\nIn the units place, the digit 4 appears once every ten numbers, so from 10-99, that's 9 times (14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94). Wait, but 44 has two 4's, so does that count twice? Hmm, yes, because each digit is counted separately. So, in the units place, it's 9 occurrences, but in 44, the tens place is also 4, which we've already counted. So, for the units place, it's 9, but 44 is included in both, but we're just counting the units place here, so 9 occurrences. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers would be 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 occurrences. \n\nWait, but 44 is counted once in the tens place and once in the units place, so that's correct. So, 19 in total for two-digit numbers. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Let's break this down into hundreds, tens, and units places. \n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The digit 4 in the hundreds place occurs from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89), so 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. \n\nNext, the tens place: In the three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 4 in the ranges 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since we're only going up to 488, the last range would be 440-449, as 450-488 would have tens digits from 5 to 8, but 440-449 is within 400-488. \n\nWait, but 440-449 is part of the hundreds place being 4, but the tens place being 4. So, each of these ranges (140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449) has 10 numbers each, so 4 ranges \u00d7 10 = 40 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. \n\nWait, but 440-449 is within the hundreds place 4, so that's correct. So, 40 occurrences in the tens place. \n\nNow, the units place: The digit 4 in the units place occurs once every hundred numbers. So, from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. \n\nIn each hundred, the units digit cycles from 0-9, so in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the units place (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194). \n\nBut since we're only going up to 488, the last hundred is 400-488. Let's check how many times 4 appears in the units place here. \n\nFrom 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-8, but 488 ends with 8, so the last number with units digit 4 is 484. So, in 400-488, the units digit 4 appears at 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times. \n\nWait, but 400-499 would have 10 occurrences, but since we're stopping at 488, it's 9. So, in the units place for three-digit numbers, it's 3 full hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contributing 10, and 400-488 contributing 9. So, 3\u00d710 + 9 = 39 occurrences. \n\nWait, but 400-488 is part of the hundreds place being 4, but we're considering units place separately. So, yes, 39 occurrences. \n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place 89 + tens place 40 + units place 39 = 89 + 40 = 129, 129 + 39 = 168. \n\nWait, let me check that again. Hundreds place: 89, tens place: 40, units place: 39. So, 89 + 40 = 129, plus 39 is 168. \n\nWait, but let me double-check the units place calculation. From 100-199: 104,114,124,134,144,154,164,174,184,194: 10 numbers. Similarly, 200-299: 10, 300-399: 10. Then 400-488: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484: 9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+9=39. That seems correct. \n\nSo, total 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1 + 19 = 20, 20 + 168 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. \n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9): the only 8 is page 8, so 1 occurrence. \n\nTwo-digit page numbers (10-99): \n\nTens place: 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. \n\nUnits place: 8 appears once every ten numbers, so from 10-99, that's 9 times (18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98). But 88 has two 8's, so in the units place, it's 9 occurrences, but in 88, the tens place is also 8, which we've already counted. So, units place: 9 occurrences. \n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. \n\nNow, three-digit page numbers (100-488): \n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1,2,3, or 4. But 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because we're only going up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 at maximum. So, no 8's in the hundreds place. \n\nTens place: The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in the ranges 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. \n\nWait, 480-488 is part of the hundreds place being 4, but the tens digit is 8 here. Let's see how many numbers are in each range. \n\n180-189: 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. \n\n280-289: 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. \n\n380-389: 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. \n\n480-488: 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), so 9 occurrences. \n\nSo, total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 occurrences. \n\nUnits place: The digit 8 in the units place occurs once every ten numbers. \n\nFrom 100-199: 108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198: 10 occurrences. \n\nFrom 200-299: 208,218,228,238,248,258,268,278,288,298: 10 occurrences. \n\nFrom 300-399: 308,318,328,338,348,358,368,378,388,398: 10 occurrences. \n\nFrom 400-488: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488: 9 occurrences, since 488 is included. \n\nSo, total units place occurrences: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. \n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place 39 + units place 39 = 78. \n\nNow, total 8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) = 1 + 19 = 20, 20 + 78 = 98. \n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check again. \n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, tens place: 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+9=39. \n\nUnits place: 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39. \n\nSo, 39 + 39 =78 in three-digit numbers. \n\nAdding single-digit 1 and two-digit 19: 1 + 19 =20, plus 78 gives 98. So, 98 8's in total. \n\nWait, but earlier, for 4's, I got 188, and for 8's, 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. \n\nLet me recount the 8's in three-digit numbers. \n\nTens place: 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39. \n\nUnits place: 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39. \n\nSo, 39+39=78. \n\nSingle-digit:1, two-digit:19, so 1+19=20. 20+78=98. \n\nWait, but when I counted the 4's, I had 188, which is correct. So, 188 - 98 =90. \n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in the 4's count. \n\nIn single-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:168. 1+19=20, 20+168=188. \n\nYes, that seems right. \n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 =90. \n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each position separately. \n\nFor 4's: \n\nUnits place: \n\nIn single-digit:1 (page 4). \n\nIn two-digit:14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94:9 times. \n\nIn three-digit:104,114,...,194 (10), 204,...,294 (10), 304,...,394 (10), 404,...,484 (9). So, 10+10+10+9=39. \n\nSo, total units place 4's:1+9+39=49. \n\nTens place: \n\nIn two-digit:40-49:10 times. \n\nIn three-digit:140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). So, 4 ranges \u00d710=40. \n\nSo, total tens place 4's:10+40=50. \n\nHundreds place: \n\nIn three-digit:400-488:89 times. \n\nSo, total hundreds place 4's:89. \n\nTotal 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188. \n\nSimilarly, for 8's: \n\nUnits place: \n\nSingle-digit:1 (page 8). \n\nTwo-digit:18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98:9 times. \n\nThree-digit:108,118,...,198 (10), 208,...,298 (10), 308,...,398 (10), 408,...,488 (9). So, 10+10+10+9=39. \n\nTotal units place 8's:1+9+39=49. \n\nTens place: \n\nTwo-digit:80-89:10 times. \n\nThree-digit:180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+9=39. \n\nTotal tens place 8's:10+39=49. \n\nHundreds place: \n\nNone, as the book only goes up to 488, so hundreds digit can't be 8. \n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. \n\nSo, difference:188-98=90. \n\nWait, so the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's. \n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't double-count any numbers. For example, in two-digit numbers, 44 is counted in both tens and units place, but when counting separately, that's correct because each digit is counted individually. Similarly, 88 is counted in both tens and units place for 8's. So, the counts are accurate. \n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Single-digit pages (1-9):** 1 occurrence (page 4).\n- **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n  - Tens place: 10 occurrences (40-49).\n  - Units place: 9 occurrences (14, 24, ..., 94).\n  - Total: 19 occurrences.\n- **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n  - Hundreds place: 89 occurrences (400-488).\n  - Tens place: 40 occurrences (140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n  - Units place: 39 occurrences (104, 114, ..., 484).\n  - Total: 168 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Single-digit pages (1-9):** 1 occurrence (page 8).\n- **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n  - Tens place: 10 occurrences (80-89).\n  - Units place: 9 occurrences (18, 28, ..., 98).\n  - Total: 19 occurrences.\n- **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n  - Tens place: 39 occurrences (180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488).\n  - Units place: 39 occurrences (108, 118, ..., 488).\n  - Total: 78 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll break this down into single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit page numbers.\n\n1. **Single-digit page numbers (1-9):** Only page 4 has a 4. So, that's 1 occurrence.\n\n2. **Two-digit page numbers (10-99):** Here, the 4 can appear in the tens place or the units place. \n   - **Tens place:** Pages 40-49. That's 10 pages, each with a 4 in the tens place. So, 10 occurrences.\n   - **Units place:** Pages like 14, 24, 34, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but 84 is in the 80s, so it's a two-digit number. Let me count them: from 10 to 99, every ten has one number ending with 4. So, that's 9 occurrences (14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94). Wait, but 44 has two 4's, right? So, does that mean I should count each digit separately? Yes, because each digit is a separate occurrence. So, in the units place, we have 9 numbers, each contributing one 4, so 9 occurrences. But wait, in the tens place, we already counted 10 occurrences. So total for two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 occurrences.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me check again. From 10 to 99, the 4 can be in the tens or units place. For the tens place, 40-49 is 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens digit, so 10 times. For the units place, it's every 10 numbers, so 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 44 has two 4's, so in the units place count, 44 contributes one 4, but in the tens place, it's already counted as part of the 40-49 range. So, the total number of 4's in two-digit numbers is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nWait, but let me think again. For the units place, from 10-99, how many times does 4 appear? It's once every ten numbers, so 9 times (10-99 is 90 numbers, so 9 times). But 44 is included in both, but we're counting digits, so each occurrence is counted separately. So, yes, 10 in tens, 9 in units, total 19.\n\n3. **Three-digit page numbers (100-488):** Now, this is a bit more complex. Let's break it down by hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, let's note that the three-digit numbers go from 100 to 488. So, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since 488 is the last page, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens and units digits are limited.\n\nLet me structure this by hundreds:\n\n- **100-199:** Hundreds digit is 1.\n- **200-299:** Hundreds digit is 2.\n- **300-399:** Hundreds digit is 3.\n- **400-488:** Hundreds digit is 4.\n\nI'll count the number of 4's in each of these ranges.\n\na. **100-199:**\n   - Hundreds digit: 1, so no 4's here.\n   - Tens digit: Can be 0-9. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, and the units digit cycles through 0-9.\n   - So, in the tens place, 4 can appear once every 10 numbers, so in 100-199, the tens digit is 4 in 140-149, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 occurrences.\n   - Similarly, in the units place, for each ten, there's a 4 in the units place. So, from 100-199, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? For each ten (100-109, 110-119, ..., 190-199), the units digit cycles 0-9, so each ten has one 4. There are 10 tens, so 10 occurrences.\n   - So, total 4's in 100-199: 10 (tens) + 10 (units) = 20.\n\nb. **200-299:**\n   - Hundreds digit: 2, so no 4's here.\n   - Tens digit: 4 appears in 240-249, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 occurrences.\n   - Units digit: Similarly, each ten has one 4, so 10 occurrences.\n   - Total 4's: 10 + 10 = 20.\n\nc. **300-399:**\n   - Hundreds digit: 3, so no 4's here.\n   - Tens digit: 4 appears in 340-349, 10 numbers. So, 10 occurrences.\n   - Units digit: Each ten has one 4, so 10 occurrences.\n   - Total 4's: 10 + 10 = 20.\n\nd. **400-488:**\n   - Hundreds digit: 4, so every number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Now, tens digit: Let's see, in 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the last). So, 400-409: tens digit 0, 410-419: tens digit 1, ..., 480-488: tens digit 8.\n   - How many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's in 440-449, which is 10 numbers (440 to 449). But wait, 488 is the end, so 449 is included. So, 10 occurrences.\n   - Units digit: In each ten, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, in 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? For each ten (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488), the units digit 4 appears once. But wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so in that last ten, units digit 4 would be at 484. So, let's calculate:\n     - From 400-479: There are 8 complete tens (400-409 up to 470-479), each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 8 occurrences.\n     - Then, 480-488: units digit 4 is at 484, so one more occurrence.\n     - So total units digit 4's: 8 + 1 = 9.\n   - So, in 400-488:\n     - Hundreds place: 89\n     - Tens place: 10\n     - Units place: 9\n     - Total 4's: 89 + 10 + 9 = 108.\n\nWait, but let me check the units digit again. From 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's list them:\n\n- 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484.\n\nThat's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-199: 20\n- 200-299: 20\n- 300-399: 20\n- 400-488: 108\nTotal 4's in three-digit numbers: 20 + 20 + 20 + 108 = 168.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that addition again: 1 + 19 is 20, plus 168 is 188. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nAgain, I'll break it down into single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit page numbers.\n\n1. **Single-digit page numbers (1-9):** Only page 8 has an 8. So, 1 occurrence.\n\n2. **Two-digit page numbers (10-99):** The 8 can appear in the tens place or the units place.\n   - **Tens place:** Pages 80-89. That's 10 pages, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, 10 occurrences.\n   - **Units place:** Pages like 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 88 has two 8's, so in the units place count, 88 contributes one 8, but in the tens place, it's already counted as part of 80-89. So, the total number of 8's in two-digit numbers is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 10-99, the 8 in the units place occurs once every ten numbers, so 9 times (10-99 is 90 numbers, so 9 times). So, 10 in tens, 9 in units, total 19.\n\n3. **Three-digit page numbers (100-488):** Again, breaking down by hundreds, tens, and units.\n\na. **100-199:**\n   - Hundreds digit: 1, so no 8's here.\n   - Tens digit: 8 appears in 180-189, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 occurrences.\n   - Units digit: Each ten has one 8, so 10 occurrences.\n   - Total 8's: 10 + 10 = 20.\n\nb. **200-299:**\n   - Hundreds digit: 2, so no 8's here.\n   - Tens digit: 8 appears in 280-289, 10 numbers. So, 10 occurrences.\n   - Units digit: Each ten has one 8, so 10 occurrences.\n   - Total 8's: 10 + 10 = 20.\n\nc. **300-399:**\n   - Hundreds digit: 3, so no 8's here.\n   - Tens digit: 8 appears in 380-389, 10 numbers. So, 10 occurrences.\n   - Units digit: Each ten has one 8, so 10 occurrences.\n   - Total 8's: 10 + 10 = 20.\n\nd. **400-488:**\n   - Hundreds digit: 4, so no 8's here.\n   - Tens digit: 8 appears in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, in the tens place, 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences.\n   - Units digit: In each ten, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, in 400-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see:\n     - From 400-479: There are 8 complete tens (400-409 up to 470-479), each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 8 occurrences.\n     - Then, 480-488: units digit 8 is at 488, so one more occurrence.\n     - So total units digit 8's: 8 + 1 = 9.\n   - So, in 400-488:\n     - Tens place: 9\n     - Units place: 9\n     - Total 8's: 9 + 9 = 18.\n\nWait, let me check the tens place again. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. But 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so that's 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8's: as above, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's in 400-488: 9 + 9 = 18.\n\nAdding up all the 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-199: 20\n- 200-299: 20\n- 300-399: 20\n- 400-488: 18\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 20 + 20 + 20 + 18 = 78.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that addition: 1 + 19 is 20, plus 78 is 98. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188\nTotal 8's: 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1 (correct)\n- Two-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 (correct)\n- Three-digit:\n  - 100-199: 10 (tens) + 10 (units) = 20\n  - 200-299: same, 20\n  - 300-399: same, 20\n  - 400-488: 89 (hundreds) + 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 108\nTotal three-digit 4's: 20 + 20 + 20 + 108 = 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188 (correct)\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1 (correct)\n- Two-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 (correct)\n- Three-digit:\n  - 100-199: 10 (tens) + 10 (units) = 20\n  - 200-299: same, 20\n  - 300-399: same, 20\n  - 400-488: 9 (tens) + 9 (units) = 18\nTotal three-digit 8's: 20 + 20 + 20 + 18 = 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98 (correct)\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the three-digit 4's count. Let me check the 400-488 range again.\n\nIn 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, so every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nTens digit: 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\nUnits digit: As before, 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 4's.\n\nSo, 89 + 10 + 9 = 108, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in 400-488:\n\nTens digit: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's.\n\nUnits digit: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 8's.\n\nSo, 9 + 9 = 18, correct.\n\nTherefore, total 4's: 188, 8's: 98, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when counting the units digits in the three-digit numbers, for 4's, in 400-488, I counted 9 units digits, but in 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs at 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, units digits: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, correct.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me just check if I included all the ranges correctly.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last number, so the last group is 480-488, which includes 484, so that's 49 times. Wait, no, 488 / 10 is 48 full tens, but from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (each 10 numbers) plus the last 8 numbers (481-488). So, in units place, 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so 48 times, plus one more in 484, so 49 times? Wait, no, because 488 is the last number, so the units digit 4 would be at 484, which is within the 480-488 range. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place from 1-488?\n\nIt's (488 // 10) + 1 if the remainder is >=4. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. Since 8 >=4, we add 1. So, 48 +1 = 49 times. So, units place: 49 4's.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 188 total 4's, which includes units, tens, and hundreds places. So, perhaps this approach is different.\n\nWait, maybe I should recalculate using digit places.\n\nLet me try this alternative method.\n\nFor each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n   - Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - Number of complete groups of 10 in 488: 48 (since 48*10=480)\n   - In each group, 4 appears once, so 48 times.\n   - Now, check the remaining 8 numbers (481-488): does 484 fall here? Yes, so one more occurrence.\n   - Total units place 4's: 48 +1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n   - Every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - Number of complete hundreds in 488: 4 (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488)\n   - For each hundred except the last, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - So, 3 hundreds (100-399) contribute 3*10=30 times.\n   - For the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But since 488 is the end, 440-449 is fully included. So, 10 times.\n   - Total tens place 4's: 30 +10=40.\n\nWait, but wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 30 +10=40.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place?\n   - Only in 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488-400+1=89).\n   - So, 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) +40 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 178.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 188. There's a discrepancy here. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let's check this alternative method.\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place: 40\nHundreds place:89\nTotal: 49+40=89, 89+89=178.\n\nBut earlier, I had 188. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, I think the alternative method is more accurate because it's a standard digit counting approach.\n\nWait, let me see where I might have gone wrong earlier.\n\nIn the first approach, for three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-199: 20 4's\n- 200-299:20\n- 300-399:20\n- 400-488:108\n\nTotal: 20+20+20+108=168\n\nPlus single-digit:1, two-digit:19, total 1+19+168=188.\n\nBut in the alternative method, it's 178.\n\nSo, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach.\n\nWait, let's see: in the first approach, in 100-199, I counted 10 (tens) +10 (units)=20.\n\nSimilarly for 200-299 and 300-399.\n\nBut in the alternative method, for 100-199, the tens place 4's are 10 (40-49 in 100-199), and units place 4's are 10 (104,114,...,194). So, 10+10=20. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly for 200-299 and 300-399, each contributes 20 4's.\n\nIn 400-488, the hundreds place is 4, so 89 times.\n\nTens place:440-449:10 times.\n\nUnits place:404,414,...,484:9 times.\n\nSo, 89+10+9=108.\n\nSo, total in three-digit:20+20+20+108=168.\n\nAdding single-digit and two-digit:1+19=20, total 168+20=188.\n\nBut in the alternative method, using digit places:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:40\n\nHundreds place:89\n\nTotal:178.\n\nSo, there's a discrepancy of 10.\n\nWait, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, in the alternative method, for the tens place, I counted 40 times. Let me check that.\n\nIn the alternative method:\n\nTens place 4's:\n\n- 100-199:10\n- 200-299:10\n- 300-399:10\n- 400-488:10\nTotal:40.\n\nBut in the first approach, in 400-488, the tens place 4's are 10 (440-449).\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nBut in the alternative method, units place is 49, which includes all units digits 4's from 1-488.\n\nIn the first approach, units digits 4's:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:9\n- Three-digit:9 (in 400-488)\nWait, no, in the first approach, for three-digit numbers, units digits 4's are 9, but in two-digit numbers, units digits 4's are 9, and single-digit is 1.\n\nSo, total units digits 4's:1+9+9=19.\n\nBut in the alternative method, units digits 4's are 49.\n\nSo, that's a big discrepancy.\n\nWait, I think I see the mistake.\n\nIn the first approach, I was only counting the units digits 4's in three-digit numbers as 9, but actually, from 1-488, the units digit 4 appears 49 times, as per the alternative method.\n\nSo, in the first approach, I undercounted the units digits 4's.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nIn the first approach, I had:\n\n- Single-digit:1 (correct)\n- Two-digit:9 (correct, because 14,24,...,94)\n- Three-digit:9 (404,414,...,484)\nTotal units digits 4's:1+9+9=19.\n\nBut in reality, from 1-488, units digit 4 appears 49 times.\n\nSo, the first approach is wrong because it's only counting the units digits 4's in three-digit numbers as 9, but actually, from 1-488, it's 49.\n\nSimilarly, for tens digits 4's: in the first approach, it's 10 (tens in two-digit) +10 (tens in 100-199) +10 (200-299) +10 (300-399) +10 (400-488) =50.\n\nWait, but in the alternative method, tens digits 4's are 40.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.\n\nI think the alternative method is correct because it systematically counts each digit place across all numbers.\n\nSo, to resolve this, I'll stick with the alternative method.\n\nSo, using the alternative method:\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:40\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal:49+40+89=178.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\n- Units place: let's calculate.\n\nUnits place 8's: From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 8 appears once.\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10:48 (since 488//10=48, with remainder 8).\n\nIn each group, 8 appears once, so 48 times.\n\nNow, check the remaining 8 numbers (481-488): does 488 fall here? Yes, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more.\n\nTotal units place 8's:48 +1=49.\n\nWait, but in the alternative method, let's check.\n\nWait, no, 488 is the last number, so the units digit 8 in 488 is included in the 48 complete groups? Wait, 488 is 48*10 +8, so the 49th group is 480-488, which includes 488.\n\nSo, units digit 8's:49.\n\nSimilarly, tens place 8's:\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nEvery 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nNumber of complete hundreds:4 (1-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488).\n\nWait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so it's in the 400-488 range.\n\nSo, for each hundred:\n\n- 1-99:80-89:10 times\n- 100-199:180-189:10\n- 200-299:280-289:10\n- 300-399:380-389:10\n- 400-488:480-488:9 times (since 480-488 is 9 numbers)\n\nSo, total tens place 8's:10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nHundreds place 8's:\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place?\n\nNever, because the hundreds digit is 1,2,3, or 4.\n\nSo, hundreds place 8's:0.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nSo, total 8's:98.\n\nTherefore, using the alternative method:\n\nTotal 4's:178\n\nTotal 8's:98\n\nDifference:178-98=80.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 178-98=80, but in the first approach, I had 188-98=90.\n\nSo, which is correct?\n\nWait, let me check the units place 4's again.\n\nIn the alternative method, units place 4's:49.\n\nIn the first approach, I had:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:9\n- Three-digit:9\nTotal:19.\n\nBut according to the alternative method, it's 49.\n\nSo, where is the discrepancy?\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the first approach by only counting the three-digit units digits as 9, but in reality, units digits 4's are much more.\n\nWait, let me list out the units digits 4's from 1-488:\n\nThey are:4,14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94,104,114,...,194,204,214,...,294,304,314,...,394,404,414,...,484.\n\nSo, from 1-99:10 numbers (4,14,...,94)\n\nFrom 100-199:10 numbers (104,114,...,194)\n\nFrom 200-299:10 numbers (204,214,...,294)\n\nFrom 300-399:10 numbers (304,314,...,394)\n\nFrom 400-488:9 numbers (404,414,...,484)\n\nSo, total units digits 4's:10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nAh, so in the first approach, I only counted the three-digit units digits as 9, but I should have added the single-digit (1), two-digit (9), and three-digit (29? Wait, no.\n\nWait, in the first approach, I think I miscounted.\n\nIn the first approach, for three-digit numbers, I considered units digits 4's as 9, but actually, from 100-488, units digits 4's are 29? No, wait, no.\n\nWait, no, in the first approach, I broke it down as:\n\n- 100-199:10 units digits 4's\n- 200-299:10\n- 300-399:10\n- 400-488:9\n\nSo, total units digits 4's in three-digit numbers:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nThen, adding single-digit and two-digit:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:9\n\nThree-digit:39\n\nTotal units digits 4's:1+9+39=49.\n\nWait, but in the first approach, I didn't separate units digits 4's; instead, I included them in the total count for each range.\n\nWait, in the first approach, I had:\n\n- Single-digit:1 (correct)\n- Two-digit:19 (10 tens,9 units)\n- Three-digit:"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the first thing I should do is figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers, and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have those counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by calculating the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit position separately.\n\n1. **Units place for 4's:**\n   - From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484.\n   - So, how many full groups of 10 are there in 488? That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a group, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. Each of these contributes one 4 in the units place.\n   - However, wait, the last group might not be complete. The last number is 488, so the units digit goes up to 8 in the 488th page. So, the 48th group ends at 480, and then we have 481 to 488. So, in the 48th group, we have 480, which has a 4 in the units place. So, actually, we do have 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place for 4's:**\n   - Similarly, in the tens place, 4 appears in every block of 100 numbers, 10 times in each block. For example, from 40-49, each number has a 4 in the tens place.\n   - Let's figure out how many such blocks there are. The total number of pages is 488, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4 (since 400-488). So, we have:\n     - From 1-99: The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers.\n     - From 100-199: The tens digit is 4 in 140-149, another 10 numbers.\n     - From 200-299: The tens digit is 4 in 240-249, another 10 numbers.\n     - From 300-399: The tens digit is 4 in 340-349, another 10 numbers.\n     - From 400-488: The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n   - Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, adding these up: 10 (from 40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449) = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place for 4's:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Wait, no. Actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check that. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 499, but since our book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's:\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the units place calculation.\n\nWait, earlier, I thought that in the units place, every 10 numbers contribute one 4, so from 1 to 488, that's 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490), but wait, 488 is less than 490, so actually, the number of full decades is 48, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last decade is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the units digit 4 appears in 484, which is within that decade. So, yes, 48 times is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, I considered 5 blocks where the tens digit is 4, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place, 89 times, which is correct because from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place for 8's:**\n   - Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490), each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times.\n   - But wait, in the last partial decade, 481-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included. So, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's included in the 48th decade. So, 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place for 8's:**\n   - In the tens place, 8 appears in every block of 100 numbers, 10 times in each block. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Let's count how many such blocks there are:\n     - From 1-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers.\n     - From 100-199: 180-189, another 10 numbers.\n     - From 200-299: 280-289, another 10 numbers.\n     - From 300-399: 380-389, another 10 numbers.\n     - From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488).\n   - Wait, so in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 from 480 to 489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n   - So, total tens place 8's: 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place for 8's:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total 8's:\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\nWait, let me check the tens place again. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is the first, then 481, 482, ..., up to 488. So that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 187\nTotal 8's: 97\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers has one 4 in the units place. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4. So, 48.\n\n- Tens place: For each hundred block, 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Each contributes 10 numbers except the last one, but wait, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 times, as each decade contributes one 8, and we have 48 full decades.\n\n- Tens place: In each hundred block, 80-89, 180-189, etc., except in the last block (400-488), it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 4*10 +9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 48 + 49 = 97.\n\nSo, 187 - 97 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Maybe I should check specific ranges.\n\nFor example, in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many 4's? Let's see, 4,14,24,...,484. The last one is 484, which is 48th occurrence because 484 = 4 + 10*(48-1) = 4 + 470 = 474? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. Wait, that would mean 49 numbers. But earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, this discrepancy needs to be resolved.\n\nWait, let's list the units digits:\n\nThe first 4 is at 4, then 14,24,...,484. How many terms are there in this sequence?\n\nThe nth term is 4 + 10*(n-1). So, 4 + 10*(n-1) \u2264 488.\n\nSo, 10*(n-1) \u2264 484\nn-1 \u2264 48.4\nn \u2264 49.4\n\nSo, n=49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. But earlier I thought 48. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48. But the 49th decade is 481-490, but we only go up to 488, so in that partial decade, 484 is included, which is the 49th 4 in the units place.\n\nSo, that means I was wrong earlier; it's 49, not 48.\n\nWait, so that changes things. So, units place for 4's is 49, not 48.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, let's check.\n\nThe first 8 is at 8, then 18,28,...,488.\n\nSo, how many terms? The nth term is 8 + 10*(n-1) \u2264 488.\n\nSo, 10*(n-1) \u2264 480\nn-1 \u2264 48\nn \u2264 49\n\nSo, 49 terms. So, units place for 8's is 49, not 48.\n\nWait, so I made a mistake earlier. I thought units place for 4's was 48, but it's actually 49. Similarly, for 8's, units place is 49.\n\nWait, let me recalculate.\n\nSo, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50 (as before)\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49 (as before)\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so I was correct initially because the difference remains the same, but the counts were slightly off because I miscounted the units place for 4's and 8's.\n\nWait, no, actually, if both units places are 49, then the difference in units place is 0, but the tens and hundreds places still contribute to the difference.\n\nWait, let me clarify.\n\nWait, for 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 98\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place for 4's was 48, but it's actually 49. So, that was a mistake I caught.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, units place is 49, not 48.\n\nSo, the correct total 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure again.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 49\nTens place for 4's: 50\nHundreds place for 4's: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nUnits place for 8's: 49\nTens place for 8's: 49\nHundreds place for 8's: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better way is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) + (if the last digit is >=4, add 1). Wait, no, that's not quite right.\n\nWait, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is:\n\nLet me think. For units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in each position, except possibly the last partial group.\n\nSo, for units digit 4:\n\nNumber of times = floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but since 488 includes 484, which is the 48th occurrence, so maybe it's 49.\n\nWait, perhaps a better formula is:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in units place from 1 to N is:\n\nfull_cycles = N // 10\ncount = full_cycles\nremainder = N % 10\nif remainder >= d:\n    count += 1\nif d == 0:\n    count -= 1  # because 0 doesn't appear in the units place of numbers >=1\n\nWait, but for d=4:\n\nfull_cycles = 488 //10 = 48\nremainder = 488 %10 =8\nsince 8 >=4, count +=1, so total 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8:\n\nfull_cycles=48\nremainder=8\nsince 8>=8, count +=1, so 48+1=49.\n\nSo, units place: 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\nThe formula is similar but with higher magnitude.\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in tens place from 1 to N:\n\nfull_cycles = N // 100\ncount = full_cycles *10\nremainder = N % 100\nif remainder >= 10*d:\n    count +=10\nelif remainder >= d*10:\n    count += (remainder - d*10 +1)\nelse:\n    pass\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of:\n\nFor each hundred block, the digit d appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., d=4: 40-49, 140-149, etc.)\n\nSo, for N=488:\n\nNumber of full hundreds = 4 (since 4*100=400 <=488)\n\nEach full hundred contributes 10 times the digit in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nNow, the remaining numbers are from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nIn the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? From 400-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each hundred. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 0 for 400-409, 1 for 410-419, ..., 8 for 480-488.\n\nSo, for d=4 in tens place in the remaining 400-488:\n\nThe tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, 440-449 is fully included, so 10 times.\n\nThus, total for tens place 4's: 4*10 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8 in tens place:\n\nIn each full hundred, 80-89, 180-189, etc., so 4*10=40.\n\nIn the remaining 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive).\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49.\n\nSo, that aligns with our earlier calculation.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nFor d=4:\n\nFrom 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nFor d=8:\n\nFrom 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 0 times.\n\nThus, total 4's: units(49) + tens(50) + hundreds(89)=188\n\nTotal 8's: units(49) + tens(49) + hundreds(0)=98\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10, contributing 48 '4's. Additionally, the last partial group (481-488) includes 484, adding 1 more '4', totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '4' appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks (including 440-449 within 400-488), each contributing 10 '4's, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, each number has '4' in the hundreds place, contributing 89 '4's.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to '4', the digit '8' appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full blocks contributing 40 '8's, and the partial block 480-488 adds 9 '8's, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, and then find the difference between these two counts. Let me tackle each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. \n\nStarting with the digit 4. I'll go through each position one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. Now, how many such sets are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then an extra 8 pages. So, in each of these 48 sets, there's one 4 in the units place, totaling 48 fours. Now, the extra 8 pages are from 481 to 488. In these, the units digits are 1-8, so 484 would be the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, that's one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for numbers 40-49, which is 10 times. So, in each 100 numbers, there are 10 fours in the tens place. Now, how many full hundreds are there in 488? That's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each of the first four hundreds, there are 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4*10 = 40 fours. Now, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). The fours in the tens place would be from 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488. So, that's another 10 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's 10 fours. So, adding that to the previous 40, we get 40 + 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because 401-488 is actually 88 numbers, but the tens digit cycles every 10. So, from 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; and so on up to 480-488, where the tens digit is 8. So, in the 401-488 range, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It would be when the tens digit is 4, which is from 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, yes, that's correct. So, total fours in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but wait again. When I consider 401-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 440-449 is indeed within that range, so 10 fours. So, 50 total fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but our book only goes up to 488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, right? So, 400 is the first, and 488 is the last, so yes, 89 numbers. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total fours in all positions would be units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but wait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Because from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so that's correct, 89 fours. So, adding up, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188 fours.\n\nNow, let me check the 8's. I need to do the same process for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Again, in every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, for 488 pages, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1-8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more, making it 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place.\n\nNow, the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, in each 100 numbers, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 488 pages, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times, so that's 4*10 = 40 eights in the tens place. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. The digit 8 in the tens place would be from 480-489, but our book only goes up to 488, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit is 8 for these 9 numbers. Wait, but wait, 480 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for the remaining 88 pages. So, total eights in the tens place would be 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but hold on, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, that's correct. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 in this book. Therefore, there are 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total eights in all positions would be units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. For the tens place in 401-488, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds:0, so total 98 eights.\n\nNow, total fours are 188, and total eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculation. Let me go through each digit place again.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units place: 48 full sets of 10, each contributing 1 four, so 48. Then, in 481-488, 484 has a 4, so +1, total 49.\n\n- Tens place: In each 100 numbers, 10 fours in the tens place. 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so +10, total 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units place: 48 full sets of 10, each contributing 1 eight, so 48. Then, in 481-488, 488 has an 8, so +1, total 49.\n\n- Tens place: In each 100 numbers, 10 eights in the tens place. 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so +9, total 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, since the book doesn't reach 800.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute 1 four.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u21d2 48 fours from 1-480.\n   - Pages 481-488: 484 adds 1 more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each 100 numbers contribute 10 fours (e.g., 40-49).\n   - 4 full hundreds (1-400) \u21d2 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Pages 401-488: 440-449 adds 10.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages 400-488: 89 numbers with hundreds digit 4.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute 1 eight.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u21d2 48 eights from 1-480.\n   - Pages 481-488: 488 adds 1 more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each 100 numbers contribute 10 eights (e.g., 80-89).\n   - 4 full hundreds \u21d2 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Pages 401-488: 480-488 adds 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages have hundreds digit 8.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I'll calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in each block of 10 numbers. So, in the units place, for every 10 numbers, each digit appears once. \n\nBut wait, from 1 to 488, the last block might not be complete. So, I need to be careful there. Let me think. \n\nFirst, the total number of page numbers is 488. So, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, how many complete cycles of 10 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete cycles and then 8 extra numbers.\n\nIn each complete cycle of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once. So, for 48 complete cycles, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the same for 8's.\n\nNow, the remaining 8 numbers are from 481 to 488. So, the units digits here are 1 through 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding these, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both digits appear the same number of times. \n\nWait, but let me check that. From 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, yes, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, units place: 49 each.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for example, in 0-99, the tens digit is 0 for 0-9, 1 for 10-19, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. \n\nBut again, since our total is 488, we need to see how many complete hundreds we have and then the remaining part. \n\n488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 numbers from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for both 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 numbers: from 401 to 488. Let's consider the tens place here. The tens digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 401-410, tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit is 1; and so on up to 480-488, tens digit is 8.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so from 481-488, the tens digit is 8. So, in the remaining 88 numbers, how many times does the tens digit 4 and 8 appear?\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, our range is up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, so that's 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit, the number of times it appears is 10, except for the last one, which might be less if we don't complete the 10 numbers. So, in this case, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times in the remaining 88 numbers. \n\nSo, total in the tens place: 4's are 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50 times. 8's are 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but hold on. Wait, in the complete hundreds, each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, 4 complete hundreds give 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total tens place: 4's = 40 + 10 = 50, 8's = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nOkay, so in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in the range 1-488, the hundreds digit can only be 1,2,3,4. There's no page number where the hundreds digit is 8, because 800 would be page 800, but our book ends at 488. So, 8 does not appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4's are 89 and 8's are 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in all places.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- Complete cycles: 48, each contributing 1, so 48.\n- Remaining 8 numbers: 481-488, units digits 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once.\nTotal 4's: 48 +1=49, 8's: 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Complete hundreds: 4, each contributing 10, so 40 for both.\n- Remaining 88 numbers: 401-488.\n  - Tens digit 4: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n  - Tens digit 8: 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\nTotal 4's: 40 +10=50, 8's:40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 times for 4.\n- 8's: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately, we determine that the digit 4 appears 188 times, while the digit 8 appears 98 times. Subtracting these gives a difference of 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Complete cycles: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n   - 4's: 48 times.\n   - 8's: 48 times.\n   - Remaining 8 numbers (481-488): 4 and 8 each appear once.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - Complete cycles: 4 (since 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.88).\n   - 4's: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - 8's: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Remaining 88 numbers (401-488):\n     - 4's: 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8's: 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4's: 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8's: 0 times (no page numbers from 800-899).\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's handle the units place. For the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and a partial group of 8 numbers (481-488). \n\nIn each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same for 8 (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). So, for each group, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. \n\nSo, for 48 complete groups, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the same for 8's. Now, in the partial group from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's. \n\nWait, but wait a second. The last partial group is from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, yes, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, both have 49 occurrences in the units place.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. For the tens digit, it cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in 40-49, 140-149, etc., and similarly for 8 in 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n\nSo, how many hundreds do we have here? From 1 to 488, we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred from 401-488. \n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the same for 8 (80-89). So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for 4's and the same for 8's. \n\nNow, the partial hundred from 401-488. Let's see, the tens digit here goes from 0 to 8. So, in 401-409, the tens digit is 0; 410-419, it's 1; and so on up to 480-488, where the tens digit is 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in this partial hundred? Well, 440-449 would be the range where the tens digit is 4. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488. That's 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here. Similarly, 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit is 8 for these 9 numbers. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the partial hundred.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in each complete hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place, but in the partial hundred, it's only 9 times. Hmm, that might affect the total count. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, no, the partial hundred is 401-488, which is 88 pages. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit, it's 10 numbers except for the last one, which is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, for the tens digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Therefore, in the partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). \n\nSo, in the tens place, the total number of 4's is 4 (from the complete hundreds) * 10 = 40, plus 10 from the partial hundred, totaling 50. For 8's, it's 4 * 10 = 40 from the complete hundreds, plus 9 from the partial hundred, totaling 49. \n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I thought each complete hundred had 10 occurrences. Let me clarify:\n\nEach complete hundred (e.g., 1-100, 101-200) has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (40-49) and 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place (80-89). So, 4 times 10 for each digit, so 40 each for 4 and 8. \n\nIn the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit runs from 0 to 8. For 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. For 8 in the tens place, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. \n\nSo, total for tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from partial) = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards, up to 488. So, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\nFor the hundreds place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. That's 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nHow about 8? Well, in the hundreds place, 8 would be from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, the count for 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 49 for both 4 and 8. In the tens place, 50 for 4 and 49 for 8. In the hundreds place, 89 for 4 and 0 for 8. So, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, but let me verify the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's, I had 50, which is 40 from the complete hundreds and 10 from the partial. For 8's, 40 from complete and 9 from partial, totaling 49. Correct.\n\nUnits place: both have 49. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 4's appear 90 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be different. Let me try another approach to confirm.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- For 4's: In every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. From 1 to 488, how many 4's in units place? It's floor(488/10) = 48 full tens, each contributing 1, plus the remainder. The remainder is 8, so 488 mod 10 is 8, which includes 4 once (at 484). So total 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSame for 8's: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, and in the remainder (1-8), 8 appears once. So 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 4's: In every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49). From 1-488, how many hundreds? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nFor 8's: Similarly, in each hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89). So 4*10=40. In 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- For 4's: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nFor 8's: There's no page 800-899, so 0.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Range:**\n   - Pages are numbered from 1 to 488.\n\n2. **Analyze Each Digit Position:**\n   - Consider units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n3. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full groups and a partial group of 8 pages.\n   - 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n   - 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\n4. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, etc.): 4 complete hundreds.\n   - 4 appears 4 * 10 = 40 times; in the partial hundred (401-488), 440-449 adds 10, totaling 50.\n   - 8 appears 4 * 10 = 40 times; in the partial hundred, 480-488 adds 9, totaling 49.\n\n5. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in pages 400-488: 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place (book ends at 488).\n\n6. **Total Counts:**\n   - **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n7. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe digit 4 is printed 90 times more than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each position in the page numbers separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there from 1 to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full groups of 10, and then 8 more numbers. So, in each group of 10, there's one 4 in the units place. So, that would be 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, and 488 has an 8 in the units place, so the last group is 480-488, which includes 484 as the 4 in the units place. So, actually, it's 48 full groups plus one more in the 480-488 group, making it 49 times. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, and 480-488 includes 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place 4's: 49 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. The number of such numbers is the number of times 4 appears in the units place. So, the first occurrence is at 4, and the last is at 484. So, the number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place 4's: 50 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, hundreds place 4's: 89 times.\n\nWait, but hold on, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those, so that's 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 +50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. I need to count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times? The first occurrence is at 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many terms? The last term is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place 8's: 49 times.\n\nNow, tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block, but since our book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, how many blocks? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except for the last block, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, 10\u00d74 +9=40+9=49. So, tens place 8's:49 times.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only for numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8. I think I might have made a mistake. Let me recount the tens place 8's.\n\nFor tens place 8, the blocks are:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, units place 8's: 49 times.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting the tens place, from 80-89, that's 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. Similarly for the other blocks. So, 5 blocks, but the last block only has 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, totaling 49.\n\nSo, total 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? The numbers are 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many terms? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place, since the book ends at 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s, so 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the hundreds place 4's were 89 times, which is from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, that seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, total 8's:98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place 4's, I had 5 blocks: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. That's correct.\n\nUnits place 4's:49, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed any 8's in the hundreds place. Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, no 8's in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but wait, is 488 included? Yes, and in 488, the hundreds digit is 4, tens is 8, units is 8. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me recount.\n\nTens place 8's:\n\n- 80-89:10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nTotal:10\u00d74 +9=49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, units place 8's:49.\n\nSo, total 8's:98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check again the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place 4's:5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50.\n\nUnits place 4's:49.\n\nTotal 4's:89+50+49=188.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly? Sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to make off-by-one errors.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's consider each digit position separately.\n\nFor units digit:\n\n- Number of 4's: floor((488 +1)/10) = floor(489/10)=48, but since 488 ends with 8, the last 4 in units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: same calculation, 49.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\n- Number of 4's: Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so for each hundred, 10 numbers. From 0-488, we have 4 complete hundreds (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399) and then 400-488.\n\nIn each of the first four hundreds, there's one block of 10 where the tens digit is 4, so 4\u00d710=40.\n\nIn the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens digit 4's:40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place:\n\nEach block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so 4\u00d710=40.\n\nIn the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens digit 8's:40+9=49.\n\nFor hundreds digit:\n\n- Number of 4's: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nNumber of 8's: From 800-899, but since our book is only up to 488, there are 0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 5 blocks, contributing 49 occurrences (with the last block having 9 numbers).\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers in the 800s, so 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of ten and then an extra 8 pages. So, in each group of ten, there's one 4 in the units place. So, 48 groups give me 48 fours. Now, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers every hundred. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes ten 4's in the tens place. Now, how many such ranges are there in 488 pages? Well, up to page 488, we have four hundreds: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, in each hundred, the range 40-49 contributes ten 4's in the tens place. So, that's four times ten, which is 40. But wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens place goes up to 8, so 440-449 is fully included, but 480-488 only goes up to 488, so the tens digit 4 appears in 480-488 as well. Wait, no, 480-488 is in the hundreds place, but the tens digit in 480 is 8, not 4. Wait, no, 440-449 is in the 400s, so that's fine. So, I think it's four times ten, which is 40. But wait, let me check: 40-49 is ten, 140-149 ten, 240-249 ten, 340-349 ten, and 440-449 ten. So that's five times ten, which is 50. Wait, but up to 488, the 440-449 is included, so that's five times ten. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me think again. The hundreds go from 0 to 4. So, 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, in each of these, the tens digit 4 appears once every hundred, so 40-49 in each hundred. So, 0-99: 40-49 (10), 100-199: 140-149 (10), 200-299: 240-249 (10), 300-399: 340-349 (10), and 400-488: 440-449 (10). So that's five sets, each contributing ten 4's in the tens place. So, 5*10=50. So, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 99 + 89 is 188? Wait, 99 + 80 is 179, plus 9 is 188. Hmm, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Then, in the tens place, we have 50 fours, and in the units place, 49 fours. So, 89 + 50 = 139, plus 49 is 188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of ten are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 eights. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers every hundred. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488, which is nine numbers (480-488). So, let's count how many full sets we have. Each hundred from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. In each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, which is ten numbers. So, that's four sets, each contributing ten 8's in the tens place, totaling 4*10=40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is nine numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's nine 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 to 899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes zero 8's.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. For the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is nine numbers, so nine 8's. So, 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the 4's in the hundreds place: From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Then, in the tens place, 50, and units place 49. So, 89 + 50 = 139 + 49 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor the 8's: Units place, 49; tens place, 49; hundreds place, 0. So, 98 total. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for 4's again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Every ten numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many such numbers? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus the last partial group, which is 481-488, which includes 484, so one more 4. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place in 4's: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each contributes ten 4's, so five sets, 5*10=50. That's correct.\n\nAnd hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's: Units place, same logic, 49. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. So, four full sets (each contributing ten 8's) and one partial set (480-488, which is nine numbers). So, 4*10=40 +9=49. So, total 49 in tens place, plus 49 in units place, total 98.\n\nSo, difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again: Is the hundreds place for 8's zero? Because 800-899 would be needed, but our book only goes up to 488, so yes, no 8's in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - For every group of ten numbers, 4 appears once.  \n   - Total groups of ten: 48 (from 1-480) + 1 (481-488) = 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.  \n   - Each hundred contributes ten 4's in the tens place.  \n   - Total: 5 ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 4 appears from 400-488.  \n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every ten numbers.  \n   - Total: 48 (from 1-480) + 1 (481-488) = 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.  \n   - Each hundred contributes ten 8's, except the last partial range.  \n   - Total: 4 full ranges \u00d7 10 = 40 + 9 (480-488) = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - No page numbers in 800-899, so 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each of these ranges and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have those counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are. That makes sense.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place for 4's. In the range from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers will have a 4 in the units place once. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4. But wait, the last group is from 481 to 490, but since we only go up to 488, the 489th number isn't there. So, in the units place, we have 48 fours? Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place is floor(488 / 10) which is 48, but since 488 is the last number, does that add an extra? Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, meaning 48 fours in the units place from 4,14,...,484. Then, 494 would be beyond 488, so no. So, 48 fours in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place for 4's. In the tens place, a 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? Well, from 1 to 488, how many hundreds are there? There are 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500). But since we only go up to 488, the last block is 401-488. So, the number of complete blocks where the tens digit is 4 is 4 (from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). Each contributes 10 fours, so 4*10=40 fours in the tens place. But wait, in the last block, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only up to 449, right? Because 450-488 have a tens digit of 5,6,7,8. So, in the 401-488 block, the tens digit is 4 from 401-409 (but wait, 401-409 is actually the hundreds place as 4, but the tens digit is 0 in 401-409, so that's not 4. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Let me clarify.\n\nActually, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, each of these ranges is 10 numbers, so 10 fours in the tens place for each. Now, how many such ranges are there within 488? 40-49 is in 1-100, 140-149 in 101-200, 240-249 in 201-300, 340-349 in 301-400, and 440-449 in 401-500. Since we're only going up to 488, the 440-449 range is fully included because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 blocks. Wait, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier by stopping at 4 blocks, but actually, there are 5 blocks because 440-449 is within 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place for 4's. The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up the fours in each place: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 fours in total.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, moving on to the number of 8's. I'll do the same process: count the 8's in units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place for 8's. Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, meaning 48 eights in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so does that add one more? Let me see: 8,18,28,...,488. The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. Wait, no, 8 is the first, 18 is the second, ..., 488 is the (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place for 8's. The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, the last range is 480-488. So, how many complete blocks are there? Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except possibly the last one if it's incomplete.\n\nFirst, 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 eights in the tens place.\n\n180-189: another 10.\n\n280-289: another 10.\n\n380-389: another 10.\n\n480-488: here, the tens digit is 8, but how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, each of these has an 8, so that's 9 eights.\n\nSo, total eights in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) = 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9. So, yes, 9 eights in the tens place from 480-488.\n\nNow, the hundreds place for 8's. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the units place. I initially thought 48 eights, but then realized it's 49 because 488 is included. So, units place: 49 eights.\n\nTens place: 49 eights.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nSo, now, the number of fours is 187, and the number of eights is 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours in the tens place. Earlier, I thought it was 5 blocks (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449), each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nAnd in the units place, 48 fours, but wait, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see: the first 4 is at 4, then every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? The nth term is 4 + 10(n-1). Let's solve for when 4 + 10(n-1) <= 488.\n\n4 + 10(n-1) <= 488 => 10(n-1) <= 484 => n-1 <= 48.4 => n <= 49.4. So, n=49. So, 49 fours in the units place. Wait, that contradicts my earlier count of 48. Hmm, so I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, earlier I thought units place fours were 48, but actually, it's 49. Because 488 is included, and 488 has an 8 in the units place, not a 4. Wait, no, 488 is 4 in the hundreds place, 8 in the tens, and 8 in the units. So, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is 484. So, how many fours in the units place? Let's see: from 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in the units place. So, I was wrong earlier; it's 49, not 48.\n\nSo, correcting that, units place fours: 49.\n\nTens place fours: 50.\n\nHundreds place fours: 89.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 187, but that was because I miscalculated the units place as 48 instead of 49.\n\nSimilarly, for eights, units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds:0, total 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake in the initial count of fours in the units place. It's actually 49, not 48, because 484 is included, which is the 49th term.\n\nSo, let's recalculate:\n\nFours:\n\nUnits: 49\n\nTens: 50\n\nHundreds: 89\n\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nEights:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:49\n\nHundreds:0\n\nTotal:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the tens place for fours. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50. That's correct.\n\nAnd the hundreds place for fours is from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nUnits place fours:49.\n\nSo, total fours:188.\n\nEights: units 49, tens 49, total 98.\n\nSo, difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89. So, I think the correct answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for fours again. From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484-4)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units place.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in units place, from 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units place.\n\nTens place for fours:50, as above.\n\nTens place for eights:49, as above.\n\nSo, fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nEights:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the key here is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll need to check each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, for the units place. In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., 44, etc. So, how many such sets are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 more numbers. So, in each of these 48 sets, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. Similarly, in every set of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (like 40-49). So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 times 10, which is 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Let's see, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., up to 8 for 481-490. Wait, but our range stops at 488, so the tens digit 8 would only go up to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the tens place here? It would be 440-449, right? That's 10 numbers. So, adding that to the previous 40, we get 40 + 10 = 50. So, total 4's in the tens place are 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 more 4's.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. Again, in every set of ten numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, up to 488, how many sets of ten are there? As before, 48 full sets and 8 extra numbers. So, 48 times 1 = 48. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once here (at 488). So, total 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. In every set of 100 numbers, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for each hundred, that's 10. There are 4 full hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place here? It would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480-489 is 10 numbers, but we're stopping at 488, so it's 9 numbers. So, 9 times. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 here.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48. Correct because 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and none in the last 8 numbers.\n\nTens place: 50. Wait, in the hundreds beyond 400, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 40 (from 1-400) + 10 = 50.\n\nHundreds place: 89 (400-488). Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems right.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and then 488 adds another, so 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 40 from 1-400, and then 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full sets of 10 in 488, so 48 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. For 400-488, it appears 10 times (440-449), adding to 50 total.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 (including 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears 10 times every 100 numbers, plus 9 times in 480-488, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. \n\nFirst, for the units place: In every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, we take the integer part, which is 48. That means there are 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. But wait, does 488 include another 4 in the units place? Let me check: 488 ends with an 8, so the last page is 488, which doesn't add another 4 in the units place. So, 48 times.\n\nNext, the tens place: Here, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, 10 times in each block. For example, from 40-49, each number has a 4 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so we have 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then the remaining 88 pages (401-488). In each of the first four blocks, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in the 400s, the tens digit is 0-8, so the digit 4 appears in the tens place for pages 440-449. That's another 10 occurrences. So, total for the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding all these up: Units place (48) + Tens place (50) + Hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many blocks of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8. That's 48. But wait, does 488 include an extra 8 in the units place? Yes, because 488 ends with an 8, so that's one more. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, from 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block of 100 has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. How many full blocks of 100 are there in 488 pages? 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full blocks. That's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the remaining 88 pages are from 401-488. In this range, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the 8 in the tens place occurs in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 pages (480-488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the 8's: Units place (49) + Tens place (49) = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because when I added the 8's in the tens place, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, but actually, from 480 to 488, inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's correct, 9 occurrences. So, total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, when counting 4's, I had 187, and 8's as 98. So, the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 times. Since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4. But wait, does the last partial block (481-488) include a 4 in the units place? 484 is within that range, so that's the 48th occurrence. So, yes, 48.\n\n- Tens place: 4 full hundreds (1-400) each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8, so 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 more. Total 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Plus the last page, 488, which adds one more, so 49.\n\n- Tens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, 9 more, totaling 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: None, as before.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the 8's correctly in the tens place. From 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189: another 10, and so on up to 380-389: 10 each. That's 4 sets, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each with one 8, so 48, plus the 488, which is another 8 in the units place, making 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nThus, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 8's. Since the book only goes up to 488, there's no page 800 or beyond, so no 8's in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nI think that's right. So, the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** In every block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 full blocks (1-480) and an additional 8 pages (481-488). Each block contributes 1 occurrence, so 48 + 1 (since 484 is within 481-488) = 49? Wait, no, earlier calculation was 48. Let me correct this.\n\n   Wait, earlier I thought 488/10=48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But 484 is within 480-488, so that's the 48th occurrence. So, units place: 48.\n\n   - **Tens place:** In each block of 100, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). There are 4 full blocks (1-400), contributing 4*10=40. In 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 more. So, total tens place: 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** In every block of 10, 8 appears once. There are 48 full blocks (1-480) contributing 48. Plus, 488 adds one more, so 49.\n   - **Tens place:** In each block of 100, 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89). There are 4 full blocks (1-400), contributing 4*10=40. In 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place: 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

Then, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each set of ten numbers. For example, from 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit appears once in the units place every ten numbers. \n\nBut wait, the first page is 1, so maybe the first set is 1-9, which is nine numbers, and then starting from 10 onwards, it's every ten numbers. Hmm, that might complicate things a bit. Let me think.\n\nActually, when counting digits, it's often easier to consider the numbers starting from 0. So, if I imagine the page numbers as 001 to 488, that might make it easier to count each digit place uniformly. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should stick with the actual page numbers, from 1 to 488.\n\nSo, let's think about the units place first. How many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of ten numbers will have exactly one 4 in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Similarly for 8, it would be 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488.\n\nBut wait, the last page is 488, which is a three-digit number, so I need to check if 488 is included when counting 8's in the units place.\n\nLet me calculate the number of times 4 appears in the units place. The first occurrence is 4, then every 10 pages after that. So, how many such numbers are there up to 488?\n\nThe number of 4's in the units place can be calculated by dividing 488 by 10, which gives 48 full tens, and then checking if the remainder includes another 4. Wait, maybe a better way is to consider how many complete groups of 10 there are and then see if there's an extra 4 in the incomplete group.\n\nBut since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (from 481 to 488). In each complete group of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 48 groups would give 48 fours. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484). So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, let's do the same. Each group of 10 has one 8 in the units place. So, 48 groups give 48 eights. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once more (488). So, total 8's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the difference here is zero. Hmm, interesting.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. Let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last group would be 440-449, and then 450-488, where the tens digit is 5,6,7,8.\n\nWait, let me think again. The tens digit is the second digit from the right. So, for numbers from 1-99, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, for 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10 numbers. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10 numbers. 300-399: 340-349, 10 numbers. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers (440-449). Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? 440,441,...,449. So, that's 10 numbers. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nFrom 40-49: 10 times\n140-149: 10\n240-249:10\n340-349:10\n440-449:10\nSo, total 5 groups, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50 times.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, total 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, for 8's in the tens place. Let's do the same. The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, let me check.\n\nFrom 1-99: 80-89: 10 numbers\n100-199: 180-189: 10\n200-299: 280-289:10\n300-399: 380-389:10\n400-488: 480-488:9 numbers\nSo, total 10+10+10+10+9=49 times.\n\nSo, 4's in the tens place:50, 8's in the tens place:49. So, the difference here is 50-49=1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. Let's count how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. But wait, that seems high. Let me confirm.\n\nWait, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers, so yes, the hundreds digit is 4 in all of these, so 89 times.\n\nNow, how about 8's in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3, or 4. It never reaches 8, because 800 would be beyond 488. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's in the hundreds place:0.\n\nSo, 4's in the hundreds place:89, 8's:0. So, the difference here is 89-0=89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nNow, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier, in the tens place, I thought 4's were 50 and 8's were 49, which is a difference of 1. Then, in the hundreds place, 89-0=89. So, total difference would be 1+89=90. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's in the units place: From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 484, which is another 4. So, total 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly for 8's in the units place: same logic, 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48, and then 488 adds another 8, making it 49. Correct.\n\nTens place for 4: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 groups, 10 each, total 50. Correct.\n\nTens place for 8: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. First four groups are 10 each, so 40, and the last group is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 8: None, as the book ends at 488. So, 0. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. When counting the hundreds place for 4's, I included 400-488, which is correct because those are all the numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. But I should check if 400 is included. Yes, because the book starts at 1, so 400 is page 400, which is included. So, 400-488 is 89 pages.\n\nAnother thing to check: When counting the tens place for 4's, I included 440-449, which is within 400-488, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, for 4's, 440-449 is part of the 400-488 range, so that's fine.\n\nWait, another thought: When counting the units and tens digits, did I consider numbers less than 100 correctly? For example, in the units place, numbers from 1-99: each digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place, right? So, for units digit 4, from 1-99, how many times does 4 appear? It's 10 times: 4,14,24,...,94. So, 10 times. Then, from 100-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, from 100-488, that's 389 numbers (since 488-100+1=389). So, 389 divided by 10 is 38 full tens, with 9 remaining. So, 38*1=38 fours in the units place from 100-488, plus the 9 numbers from 481-488, which includes 484, so one more 4. So, total 38+1=39. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 49. Hmm, that's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate the units place.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate how many times each digit appears in each position from 1 to 488.\n\nLet me consider each digit position separately.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFor units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in each position, except possibly the last partial group.\n\nTotal numbers:488\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(488/10)=48 groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 fours.\n\nRemaining numbers:488 - 48*10=8 numbers:481,482,...,488.\n\nIn these 8 numbers, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484).\n\nSo, total 4's in units place:48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly for 8's in units place:48 groups, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus in the remaining 8 numbers, 8 appears once (488). So, total 49.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each block of 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each.\n\nBut let's break it down.\n\nTotal numbers:488.\n\nLet's consider how many complete hundreds there are: floor(488/100)=4 complete hundreds (1-100,101-200,201-300,301-400), and then 401-488, which is 88 numbers.\n\nIn each complete hundred (1-100, etc.), the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and similarly for 8.\n\nSo, for 4's in tens place:4 hundreds *10=40 times.\n\nNow, in the partial hundred (401-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., 8 for 481-490. But since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers.\n\nWait, but we're looking for the tens digit being 4. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., 8 (481-488). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 numbers:441,442,...,450. But wait, 450 is included in 401-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, in the partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in tens place:40 (from complete hundreds) +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place: in each complete hundred, 10 times, so 4*10=40. In the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, 40+8=48. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 49. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me check again. In the partial hundred 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but 480 is included in 401-488, right? Because 480 is less than 488.\n\nWait, no, 480 is less than 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers:480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 for these 9 numbers. So, in the partial hundred, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, total 8's in tens place:40 (from complete hundreds) +9=49.\n\nSo, that matches my earlier calculation. So, 4's in tens place:50, 8's:49.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nFor hundreds digit, each digit from 1-4 appears in the hundreds place for 100 numbers each, except possibly the last one if the total is less than the next hundred.\n\nSo, from 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's here.\n\n100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's.\n\n200-299: hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's or 8's.\n\n300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's or 8's.\n\n400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so from 400-488, that's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nFor 8's in hundreds place: since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place:89, 8's:0.\n\nNow, summing up:\n\nTotal 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place, making total 8's in tens place 49. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I first considered the tens place for 8's, I thought of 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributing 10, and then 480-488 contributing 9, so 4*10 +9=49. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nAnother way to calculate is to use the formula for digit frequency.\n\nFor a given digit d and position p (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times d appears can be calculated as:\n\nhigher digits * 10^(position) + something based on the current digit and lower digits.\n\nBut since 488 is not a very large number, perhaps the initial method is sufficient.\n\nWait, but let me try applying the formula to cross-verify.\n\nLet me consider each position.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFor units digit, the number of times 4 appears is:\n\nnumber of complete groups of 10: floor(488/10)=48, each contributing 1 four, so 48.\n\nRemaining numbers:488%10=8, so from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once.\n\nTotal:48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for 8's:48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in tens place:\n\nWe can think of it as:\n\nFor each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times.\n\nSo, for the first 400 numbers (1-400), there are 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8.\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place:40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly for 8's in tens place:\n\nFrom 1-400, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-399, hundreds digit is 1,2,3, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, so 89 numbers, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo, 4's in hundreds place:89.\n\n8's in hundreds place:0.\n\nSo, same as before.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nI think I've double-checked all the steps, so I'm confident that the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** 48 full groups of 10 (each contributing one 4) + 1 from the remaining 8 numbers (484) = 49.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, 48 full groups + 1 from the remaining 8 numbers (488) = 49.\n   - **Difference:** 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 each + 10 from 440-449 = 50.\n   - **8's:** 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 each + 9 from 480-488 = 49.\n   - **Difference:** 1.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** 89 times from 400-488.\n   - **8's:** 0 times.\n   - **Difference:** 89.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Final Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. \n\nFirst, the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, I think it's 48 times, but wait, 48 times 10 is 480, and then from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again. So, 48 times in the units place.\n\nWait, let me check that. From 1 to 480, every 10 pages, 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times (since 480 / 10 = 48). Then from 481 to 488, as I said, no 4's in the units place. So, total 48 times.\n\nNext, the tens place. In the tens place, 4 appears as a digit every 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds and then 88 pages. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, 4 times 10 is 40. But wait, let me check if the last partial hundred (88 pages) includes a 4 in the tens place. The last partial hundred is 400-488. In this range, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, which is 10 pages. So, total number of times 4 appears in the tens place is 4 times 10 (from each hundred) plus 10 (from 400-409). Wait, but 400-488 includes 400-409, which is 10 pages, so that's an extra 10. So, total is 4*10 + 10 = 50 times. Hmm, that seems right.\n\nWait, but actually, from 1-488, the hundreds are 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49 in 0-99, 140-149 in 100-199, etc.), so that's 4*10 = 40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears from 400-409, which is 10 times. So, total 40 + 10 = 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 pages. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. Wait, 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187? Wait, 48 + 50 is 98, 98 + 89 is 187? Wait, no, that can't be right because 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187? Wait, 98 + 89 is 187? Let me check: 98 + 80 is 178, plus 9 is 187. Hmm, okay, so 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so yes, the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those 89 pages. So, 89 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the digit 8. I'll do the same process.\n\nFirst, units place. Every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full times, but wait, from 1 to 488, the last number is 488, which ends with 8, so that's an extra 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nWait, let me think again. From 1 to 480, 480 / 10 = 48, so 48 times. Then from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more at 488. So, total 49 times.\n\nNext, the tens place. In the tens place, 8 appears in blocks of 100, specifically from 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nEach hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers), 100-199: 180-189 (10), 200-299: 280-289 (10), 300-399: 380-389 (10), and 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers because 480-488 is 9 pages, right? Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, that's 9 pages where the tens digit is 8. So, for each full hundred, we have 10, and in the last partial hundred, 9.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 9 in the last partial hundred, so 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: 0-99: 80-89 (10), 100-199: 180-189 (10), 200-299: 280-289 (10), 300-399: 380-389 (10), and 400-488: 480-488 (9). So, yes, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so 98 total 8's.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me just verify my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 times (from 4,14,24,...,474,484). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last 4 in the units place before 488. So, 48 times.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. There are 4 full hundreds (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399) and the last partial hundred 400-488. In each full hundred, 10 times, so 4*10=40. In the last partial hundred, 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 400-409, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 +10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 48+50+89=187.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Units place: From 8,18,28,...,478,488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full times, plus one more at 488, so 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 4 full hundreds (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. The last partial hundred 400-488 contributes 9 numbers (480-488). So, 40 +9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: None, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89. So, 49 more 4's than 8's? Wait, no, 187 -98=89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this or if I might have missed something.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider each digit position separately and calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each.\n\nFor units digit:\n\n- For 4's: From 1-488, how many numbers end with 4? It's floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 ends with 8, the last 4 is at 484, so 48 times.\n\n- For 8's: Similarly, floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 ends with 8, it's 49 times.\n\nWait, that's what I had before.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\n- For 4's: Each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4. There are 4 full hundreds and one partial. In the partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 4 appears from 400-409, which is 10 numbers. So, 4*10 +10=50.\n\n- For 8's: Each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 8. There are 4 full hundreds and one partial. In the partial hundred, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nFor hundreds digit:\n\n- For 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\n- For 8's: 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 48 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =187.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:187-98=89.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n\n   - **Units Place (1-488):**\n     - Every 10 numbers, '4' appears once in the units place.\n     - Total cycles: 488 / 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 full cycles.\n     - However, since 484 is within the range, it adds one more occurrence.\n     - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.

    "text": " \n\nI think I'll need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start with the digit 4. \n\nFirst, the units place. For every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 complete sets of 10, and then 8 extra numbers. In each set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4 hundreds would give 4*10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 1 for 410-419, 2 for 420-429, 3 for 430-439, 4 for 440-449, and then 5-8 for 450-488. Wait, so in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 only from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that adds another 10 times. So total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but hold on, 401-488 is only 88 pages, so from 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So yes, 10 more times. So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10? 48 complete sets, as before, and 8 extra numbers. So, 48 times in the units place, plus 1 more if 8 is in the units place in the last 8 numbers (481-488). 488 is the last page, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, in each hundred, that's 10 times. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4*10=40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me think again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, 9 more, so total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98. That seems correct.\n\nSo, now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems high.\n\nFirst, 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right.\n\n8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check that again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 times, correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place in 4's, from 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 4 hundreds and then 440-449 in the 400s, which would be 5 sets. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds go up to 400, so 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. So, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is another 10. So, total 50, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, in the last partial hundred, it's 9 instead of 10 because the book ends at 488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place, correct.\n\nWait, but when I count the units place for 8's, I thought 488 is included, so 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's 1 more, making it 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 fours and 98 eights, difference is 90. Hmm.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I overcounted the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 times. That's correct.\n\nWait, but let me count manually for a smaller range to see if my method is correct. Let's say a 100-page book. How many 4's and 8's would there be?\n\nFor 4's: units place: 10 times (4,14,...,94). Tens place: 10 times (40-49). Hundreds place: 0, since it's only up to 100. So, total 20 4's.\n\nFor 8's: units place:10 times (8,18,...,98). Tens place:10 times (80-89). Hundreds place:0. So, total 20 8's. So, difference is 0, which makes sense.\n\nWait, but in my method, for 100 pages, units place 4's:10, tens:10, hundreds:0. So, 20. Similarly for 8's:20. So, correct.\n\nAnother test: a 200-page book.\n\n4's: units:20 (4,14,...,194). Tens:20 (40-49, 140-149). Hundreds:0. So, total 40.\n\n8's: units:20 (8,18,...,198). Tens:20 (80-89,180-189). Hundreds:0. So, total 40. Difference 0.\n\nWait, but in a 200-page book, 4's would be 20 (units) + 20 (tens) =40, correct.\n\nSimilarly, 8's:20 +20=40.\n\nNow, let's try a 488-page book. So, 4's: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 188. 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. So, difference 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for 4's. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial ten, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial ten, 481-488, units digits 1-8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nFor the tens place in 4's: in each hundred, 40-49 is 10 numbers. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) would give 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is another 10. So, total 50. Correct.\n\nFor the tens place in 8's: in each hundred, 80-89 is 10 numbers. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 40+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 8's: none, since the book ends at 488. So, 0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. Maybe I'm missing something. For example, in the hundreds place, does 400-488 include 89 numbers? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. Correct.\n\nAnd in the tens place for 4's, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for 8's, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10, contributing 48 instances. Additionally, in the last partial set (481-488), 484 adds one more. Total: 49.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100. In each hundred, this occurs 10 times. For 400-488, it occurs an additional 10 times. Total: 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10, contributing 48 instances. Additionally, in the last partial set (481-488), 488 adds one more. Total: 49.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100. In each hundred, this occurs 10 times. In the last partial hundred (401-488), it occurs 9 times (480-488). Total: 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488. Total: 0.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should calculate how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet's start with the digit 4. \n\nFirst, the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, in the last partial cycle, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 would be the last page with a 4 in the units place. So that's 48 times plus one more in 484, making it 49 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. In the tens place, 4 appears in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes 10 times the digit 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are in 488 pages. \n\nThe first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10. Then 240-249, another 10. Then 340-349, another 10. Then 440-449, another 10. Wait, but 488 is less than 490, so does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's five blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So 5 * 10 = 50 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. In the hundreds place, 4 appears from page 400 to 488. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages, meaning 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, contributing 48 times. Then, in the last partial cycle from 481-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included. So, that's another 1, making it 49 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me count how many full blocks there are. \n\nFrom 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place.\nFrom 180-189: another 10.\nFrom 280-289: another 10.\nFrom 380-389: another 10.\nAnd then 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so 9 times the digit 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero times.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9 is indeed 49. So, total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait a second, did I count correctly? Let me verify each step again.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing a 4, and then 484 is the 49th. So 49.\n- Tens: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each with 10 4's in tens place. So 5*10=50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 pages. So 89 4's in hundreds place.\nTotal: 49 +50 +89=188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: Same as 4's, 48 full tens, and 488 adds another, so 49.\n- Tens: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n- Hundreds: 800-899, which isn't in our range, so 0.\nTotal: 49+49=98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but when I thought about the hundreds place for 8's, I considered 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so no 8's in hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nI think that's accurate. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position and then add them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once. \n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and an additional 8 pages (481 to 488). In each of these 48 blocks, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, that's 48 times each. \n\nNow, checking the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding these, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, which is also 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so from 481 to 488, that's 8 pages, units digits 1 through 8. So, yes, 484 has a 4 in the units, and 488 has an 8. So, units place: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digits in the incomplete block are 1 to 8, so 484 is included. So, units place: 49 4's and 49 8's. So, they're equal in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers. For example, from 0-9, the tens digit is 0; from 10-19, it's 1; and so on. So, for the tens digit, each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n\nSo, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see. From 40-49, the tens digit is 4, so that's 10 times. Similarly, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's count the blocks:\n\n- 40-49: 10\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249: 10\n- 340-349: 10\n- 440-449: 10\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, and since the book has 488 pages, that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place, let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-489: but wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 pages. So, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but only from 480 to 488, which is 9 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nSo, for 8's in the tens place, we have:\n\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9\n\nAdding these up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in pages 400-488. How many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. The hundreds digits go up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- Each block of 10 has one 4 and one 8. There are 48 complete blocks (480 pages), so 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4's and 8's. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 4's: Each block of 100 has a decade where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 times. There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). So, 5 x 10 = 50. Correct.\n\n- For 8's: Similarly, each block of 100 has a decade where tens digit is 8, which is 10 times. But in the last block (400-488), the tens digit 8 runs from 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 4 blocks of 10 each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial block of 9. So, 4 x 10 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488). Correct.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I thought about the hundreds place, I considered 400-488 as 89 pages. Let me check that: 488 - 400 = 88, but since we include both endpoints, it's 89 pages. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about the hundreds place: For each hundred block, the hundreds digit is 1,2,3,4. So, 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 times. So, correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct, so the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each position in the page numbers separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 full sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full set, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit is 1 through 8, so no 4's there. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a block of 10 numbers every 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, we have 488 numbers, so the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\nFor the tens digit 4, in the 1-99 range, the block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, in the 100-199 range, it's 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 blocks in total, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but hold on, 440-449 is within 488, right? 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nWait, let me check that. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? Well, 488 - 400 = 88, so adding 1 gives 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me sum up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more 8. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block is 10 numbers, contributing 10 8's in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nIn the 1-99 range, the block is 80-89, which is 10 numbers. Then, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. So that's 4 blocks in total, each contributing 10 8's. So, 4 * 10 = 40 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but does 380-389 fall within 488? Yes, 389 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 4 blocks, 10 each, so 40.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's there.\n\nNow, summing up the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89.\n\nSo, total 4's are 187, and total 8's are 89. The difference is 187 - 89 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 40\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 40 = 89. That also seems correct.\n\nDifference: 187 - 89 = 98. So, there are 98 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any edge cases. For example, in the units place for 8's, I considered that 488 has an 8, so that's why I added 1 to the 48. Similarly, for the tens place, I had 4 blocks, which seems right because 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four blocks, each with 10 8's, so 40. That seems correct.\n\nAlso, for the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers starting with 8, so no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 98 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 48 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 40 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 40 + 0 = 89.\n\n3. **Difference:** 187 (4's) - 89 (8's) = 98.\n\n\\boxed{98}"

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times 8 appears. Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. Let's start by counting the number of 4's.\n\nFirst, for the single-digit page numbers (1-9), only page 4 has a 4. So that's one 4.\n\nNext, for the two-digit numbers, from 10 to 99. Here, the digits can be in the tens place or the units place. Let's consider the tens place first. The numbers 40-49 have 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's. Now, for the units place, the 4 appears in numbers like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, but wait, 44 has two 4's, so does that mean I should count each occurrence? I think so. So, from 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94, each has one 4 except 44 which has two. So, that's 9 + 1 = 10 4's in the units place. So, for two-digit numbers, total 4's are 10 (tens) + 10 (units) = 20 4's.\n\nWait, but hold on, 44 is counted twice, once in the tens and once in the units. So, in total, for two-digit numbers, 10 (tens) + 9 (units without 44) + 1 (extra 4 from 44) = 20. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers, from 100 to 488. Let's break this down further. The three-digit numbers can be from 100 to 399 and 400 to 488. Let me handle each range separately.\n\nFirst, 100 to 399. Let's count the number of 4's in the hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 doesn't appear here because we're only considering up to 399, so hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3. So, no 4's in the hundreds place for 100-399.\n- Tens place: The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like x4y, where x is 1, 2, 3 and y is 0-9. So, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times per hundred. So, 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 4's in the tens place.\n- Units place: Similarly, the units digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, there are 10 numbers ending with 4 (like 104, 114, ..., 194; same for 200s and 300s). So, 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 4's in the units place.\n\nSo, total 4's from 100-399: 30 (tens) + 30 (units) = 60 4's.\n\nNow, moving on to 400-488. Here, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's a lot of 4's right there.\n\n- Hundreds place: Every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n- Tens place: Now, looking at the tens digit. The tens digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the last number). So, for each tens digit (0-8), how many times does 4 appear? Wait, no, I'm supposed to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. So, in the range 400-488, the tens digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, when the tens digit is 4, the numbers are 440-449. How many numbers is that? 449 - 440 + 1 = 10 numbers. So, 10 4's in the tens place.\n- Units place: Similarly, the units digit can be 0-9, but in the range 400-488, the units digit goes up to 8. So, for each hundred (which is just 400-488 here), the units digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 400-488, how many times does the units digit 4 appear? Let's see: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488, so only up to 484. So, that's 9 4's in the units place.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 400-488, how many numbers end with 4? Starting at 404, then every 10 pages: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 404 + 10*(n-1) = 484 when n=9. So, yes, 9 4's in the units place.\n\nSo, total 4's from 400-488: 89 (hundreds) + 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 108 4's.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's from each section:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 20\n- Three-digit (100-399): 60\n- Three-digit (400-488): 108\nTotal 4's = 1 + 20 + 60 + 108 = 189.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check the three-digit counts. For 100-399, I had 30 (tens) + 30 (units) = 60. That seems correct because each hundred contributes 10 in tens and 10 in units, so 3\u00d710 + 3\u00d710 = 60. Then, 400-488: 89 in hundreds, 10 in tens, 9 in units, totaling 108. So, 60 + 108 = 168. Plus the single and two-digit, 1 + 20 = 21. So, 21 + 168 = 189. Hmm, maybe that's correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9): only page 8 has an 8. So, that's 1.\n\nTwo-digit numbers (10-99):\n\n- Tens place: The 8 appears in 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n- Units place: The 8 appears in numbers like 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 numbers, but 88 has two 8's. So, how many 8's? Each of these numbers contributes one 8 except 88, which contributes two. So, total units place 8's: 9 + 1 = 10.\n\nSo, two-digit 8's: 10 (tens) + 10 (units) = 20.\n\nThree-digit numbers (100-488):\n\nLet's break this down into 100-399 and 400-488.\n\nFirst, 100-399:\n\n- Hundreds place: 8 doesn't appear here, as hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3.\n- Tens place: The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like x8y, where x is 1, 2, 3. So, for each hundred, the tens digit 8 occurs 10 times. So, 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 8's.\n- Units place: Similarly, the units digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, 10 numbers ending with 8. So, 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's from 100-399: 30 (tens) + 30 (units) = 60.\n\nNow, 400-488:\n\n- Hundreds place: 8 doesn't appear here since it's 400-488.\n- Tens place: The tens digit can be 0-8. So, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, 9 8's in the tens place.\n- Units place: The units digit can be 0-8. So, for each hundred (which is 400-488), the units digit 8 appears in numbers like 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers. However, 488 has two 8's (tens and units), but we're only counting the units place here. So, each of these contributes one 8, so 9 8's in the units place.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so when we count units place 8's, it's 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 9 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's from 400-488: 9 (tens) + 9 (units) = 18.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. When the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-488. So, that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the tens place. So, yes, 9 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's from three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-399: 60\n- 400-488: 18\nTotal: 60 + 18 = 78.\n\nAdding up all the 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 20\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal 8's = 1 + 20 + 78 = 99.\n\nWait, that seems a bit low compared to the 4's. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, 100-399: 30 (tens) + 30 (units) = 60. That's correct. Then 400-488: 9 (tens) + 9 (units) = 18. So, total 78. Then, single-digit 1 and two-digit 20, so 1 + 20 = 21. 21 + 78 = 99. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 189\nTotal 8's: 99\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 189 - 99 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the counts because sometimes it's easy to miss a digit or count an extra.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 4)\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens: 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 4's\n- Units: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94: 9 numbers, but 44 has two 4's, so that's 9 +1 = 10 4's\n\nTotal two-digit 4's: 10 + 10 = 20\n\nThree-digit:\n\n100-399:\n\n- Tens: For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times each. So, 3\u00d710=30\n- Units: Similarly, units digit 4 occurs 10 times per hundred, so 3\u00d710=30\nTotal: 60\n\n400-488:\n\n- Hundreds: 89 numbers (400-488), so 89 4's\n- Tens: 440-449: 10 numbers, so 10 4's\n- Units: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484: 9 numbers, so 9 4's\nTotal: 89 +10 +9=108\n\nAdding up: 1 + 20 + 60 + 108 = 189. That seems correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 8)\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's\n- Units: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98: 9 numbers, but 88 has two 8's, so 9 +1=10 8's\nTotal: 10 +10=20\n\nThree-digit:\n\n100-399:\n\n- Tens: For each hundred, tens digit 8 occurs 10 times, so 3\u00d710=30\n- Units: Units digit 8 occurs 10 times per hundred, so 3\u00d710=30\nTotal: 60\n\n400-488:\n\n- Tens: 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 8's\n- Units: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488: 9 numbers, so 9 8's\nTotal: 9 +9=18\n\nAdding up: 1 +20 +60 +18=99\n\nSo, 189 -99=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 189, and the number of 8's is 99. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the difference. Let's tackle the 4's first.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: 1-9. The digit 4 appears once here, which is on page 4.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: 10-99. I'll need to consider both the tens place and the units place. \n\nFor the tens place, the numbers 40-49 have 4 in the tens digit. That's 10 pages, so 10 occurrences of the digit 4.\n\nFor the units place, the 4 appears every 10 numbers: 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but from 10-99, that's 9 occurrences (since 44 has two 4's, but I'm counting each digit separately, so 44 contributes two 4's, but I think I should count each digit occurrence individually. Wait, no, maybe I should count each page number's digits separately. So, for the units place in two-digit numbers, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see: from 10-99, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So for each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 ten's groups (10-99), so 9 times. But wait, 40-49 is already counted in the tens place, so in the units place, from 10-99, 4 appears 9 times in the units digit. But wait, 44 is in the 40-49 group, so in the units place, it's 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 times, but 44 has two 4's, so does that affect the count? Wait, no, because we're counting each digit occurrence, so 44 contributes two 4's, but in the units place, each occurrence is counted separately. So, from 10-99, the units digit 4 appears 9 times, and the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So total for two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 occurrences of 4.\n\nWait, but 44 is in both the tens and units place, so in the tens place, 40-49 is 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. Then, in the units place, 44 is one of the 9 numbers where the units digit is 4, so that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100-488. Let's break this down into hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, pages 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nFor the hundreds digit being 4: That's pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nNow, for the tens place in three-digit numbers: We need to consider each hundred group and how many times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nIn each hundred group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles 0-9 every 10 pages. So, for each hundred group, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). \n\nFor 100-199: Tens digit 4 occurs from 140-149, which is 10 pages, so 10 occurrences.\n\nSimilarly, 200-299: 240-249, another 10.\n\n300-399: 340-349, another 10.\n\n400-488: The tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 pages, but wait, 488 is the last page. So, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 pages, so 10 occurrences.\n\nSo total for tens place in three-digit numbers: 10 (100s) + 10 (200s) + 10 (300s) + 10 (400s) = 40 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is correct.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers: Again, for each hundred group, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 pages. So, in each hundred group, the units digit 4 appears once every 10 pages, so 10 times per hundred group.\n\nSo, 100-199: units digit 4 appears 10 times (104,114,...,194).\n\nSimilarly, 200-299: 10 times.\n\n300-399: 10 times.\n\n400-488: units digit 4 appears from 404,414,...,484. How many times? Let's see, starting at 404, each 10 pages, so 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 times because 484 is the last one before 488. Wait, 404 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So n= (484-404)/10 +1 = 8 +1=9 times. So, in 400-488, units digit 4 appears 9 times.\n\nSo total units digit 4 in three-digit numbers: 10 (100s) +10 (200s)+10 (300s)+9 (400s)=39.\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers: hundreds place 89, tens place 40, units place 39. So total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89+40+39=168.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:168\n\nTotal 4's:1+19=20; 20+168=188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nStarting with single-digit: 8 appears once, on page 8.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: 10-99.\n\nTens place: 80-89, which is 10 pages, so 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: 8 appears once every 10 pages, so from 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 times, but wait, 88 has two 8's, but we're counting each digit occurrence. So, units digit 8 appears 9 times in two-digit numbers (since 88 is included, but we count each occurrence).\n\nWait, no, in two-digit numbers, the units digit 8 appears in 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98, which is 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So that's 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: tens place 10 + units place 9 =19.\n\nThree-digit numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0.\n\nTens place: In each hundred group, the tens digit is 8 for 10 pages (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, etc.).\n\nSo, 100-199: 180-189, 10 pages, so 10 occurrences.\n\n200-299: 280-289, 10.\n\n300-399: 380-389, 10.\n\n400-488: 480-488, but wait, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but our book stops at 488, so 480-488 is 9 pages. So, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 pages, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's in three-digit numbers: 10 (100s) +10 (200s)+10 (300s)+9 (400s)=39.\n\nUnits place: In each hundred group, the units digit is 8 once every 10 pages.\n\nSo, 100-199: 108,118,...,198: 10 occurrences.\n\n200-299: 208,218,...,298:10.\n\n300-399:308,318,...,398:10.\n\n400-488:408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 occurrences because 488 is the last page.\n\nSo, units place 8's in three-digit numbers:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place 39 + units place 39=78.\n\nAdding up all 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:78\n\nTotal 8's:1+19=20; 20+78=98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19\n\nThree-digit:89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units)=168\n\nTotal 4's:1+19=20; 20+168=188. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19\n\nThree-digit: tens place:10+10+10+9=39; units place:10+10+10+9=39; total 78.\n\nTotal 8's:1+19=20; 20+78=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the three-digit tens place for 4's. I said 40 occurrences. Let me see: 100-199:140-149 (10), 200-299:240-249 (10), 300-399:340-349 (10), 400-488:440-449 (10). So that's 4*10=40. Correct.\n\nFor units place in three-digit 4's:100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9 (since 484 is the last one). So 10+10+10+9=39. Correct.\n\nThree-digit hundreds place:400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 4's in hundreds place.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\nTens place:100-199:180-189 (10), 200-299:280-289 (10), 300-399:380-389 (10), 400-488:480-488 (9). So 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nUnits place:100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nTotal 8's:39+39=78.\n\nAdding single and two-digit:1+19=20; 20+78=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 40-49 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: 14,24,...,94 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n     - Tens place: 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 40 occurrences.\n     - Units place: 104,114,...,484 \u2192 39 occurrences.\n     - Total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n   - **Total '4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** 8 appears once (page 8).\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 80-89 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: 18,28,...,98 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: 800-899 (not applicable as book ends at 488) \u2192 0.\n     - Tens place: 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 39 occurrences.\n     - Units place: 108,118,...,488 \u2192 39 occurrences.\n     - Total: 39 + 39 = 78.\n   - **Total '8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's - Number of '8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 more times than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the approach here is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit position one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). In each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 times. So, in each 100-number block, there are 10 4's in the tens place. \n\nNow, how many full 100-number blocks are there in 488? There are four full blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Then, we have the last partial block from 401-488. Here, the tens digit is 0-8 in the 400's. So, the tens digit is 4 only once, from 440-449. Wait, no, actually, in the 400's, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, let's check. 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10 4's in the tens place. So, the total for the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check that. The first four blocks (1-400) contribute 4*10=40, and then 401-488 includes 440-449, which is another 10, so yes, 50 in total.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the 400's, which is from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but actually, in the hundreds place, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4, so that's 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, units place: 48 times.\n\nTens place: 50 times.\n\nHundreds place: 89 times.\n\nSo, 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is indeed 187. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in each position.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full blocks of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last partial block is 481-488, where the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once here as well (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. In each block of 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each 100-number block, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many full 100-number blocks do we have? Four: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the last partial block is 401-488. The tens digit here cycles from 0-8, so 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but wait, the tens digit is 8 only once, from 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place in 401-488? It's 9 times (480-488). Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but we're stopping at 488, so it's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 for each of these 9 numbers, so that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. In the 400's, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the 800's, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, there are 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so number of 4's is 187 and number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\nUnits place: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear, so units total is 48.\n\nTens place: Each 100 has 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 blocks (1-400) contribute 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, 40 +10=50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 +50 +89=187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last partial ten (481-488) includes 488, which has an 8 in the units place, so +1, total 49.\n\nTens place: Each 100 has 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 blocks contribute 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more. So, 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, since we don't reach 800.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49=98.\n\nDifference: 187 -98=89.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. In the last partial block, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 40 +9=49.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 187 and 8's is 98, so 187-98=89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct.\n\nAnd for 8's, since the book ends at 488, there's no 800's, so hundreds place for 8's is 0.\n\nSo, the final answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't double-count or miss any numbers.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider each digit position separately and calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) = 48, and if the last digit is >=4, we add 1 if the last number's units digit is >=4. Wait, but 488's units digit is 8, which is >=4, so we add 1. So, 48 +1=49? Wait, no, that's for counting numbers up to 488 where units digit is 4. Wait, no, perhaps I'm confusing methods.\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: For each complete set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. The number of complete sets is floor(488/10)=48. Now, in the incomplete set (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total 4's in units place: 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48, but now I'm getting 49. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Let me figure this out.\n\nWait, in the first approach, I thought that in the last partial block (481-488), 4 doesn't appear in the units place because 481-488 ends at 488, and 484 is within that range. So, 484 is page 484, which is within 481-488. So, that's an extra 4 in the units place. So, total units 4's would be 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recast this.\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated as:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(N/10) = 48.\n\nIf N mod 10 >= d, then add 1.\n\nHere, N=488, so N mod 10=8, which is >=4, so add 1.\n\nThus, total units 4's: 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place:\n\nNumber of complete groups: floor(488/10)=48.\n\nN mod 10=8, which is equal to 8, so add 1.\n\nThus, units 8's:48 +1=49.\n\nWait, so earlier I had units 4's as 48, but actually it's 49. That changes things.\n\nSimilarly, let me recalculate the 4's and 8's correctly.\n\nSo, for 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nTens place: Let's calculate it properly.\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nEach 100 numbers have 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: floor(488/100)=4.\n\nEach contributes 10, so 4*10=40.\n\nNow, the remaining numbers: 488 - 4*100=88.\n\nIn the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nThe tens digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8.\n\nThe tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers, thus 10 more 4's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total tens 4's:40 +10=50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, each number has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 187, but now it's 188. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me check again.\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nTens place:50.\n\nHundreds place:89.\n\n49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nTens place: Let's calculate.\n\nNumber of times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nEach 100 numbers have 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place (80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40.\n\nRemaining numbers:488 -400=88.\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 more 8's in the tens place.\n\nTotal tens 8's:40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:0, as before.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nSo, total 4's:188.\n\nTotal 8's:98.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but now I'm getting 90, whereas earlier I thought 89. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let me recount the units place for 4's.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the units digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n\nNumber of complete tens:48.\n\nIf the last number's units digit is >=4, add 1.\n\n488 mod10=8>=4, so add 1.\n\nThus, units 4's:48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, units 8's:48 +1=49.\n\nTens 4's:40 +10=50.\n\nTens 8's:40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds 4's:89.\n\nHundreds 8's:0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, so I must have made a mistake in my initial calculation by not considering that the last partial block for 4's in the units place includes 484, which adds an extra 4.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for 8's, the last partial block includes 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8, contributing 9 more 8's.\n\nThus, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me manually count for a smaller range to see if my method is correct.\n\nFor example, let's take a book with 40 pages.\n\nHow many 4's and 8's would there be?\n\nPage numbers 1-40.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\nUnits place: 4,14,24,34: 4 times.\n\nTens place:40-49, but since we only go up to 40, it's just 40, which is one 4 in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal 4's:4+1=5.\n\nCounting 8's:\n\nUnits place:8,18,28,38:4 times.\n\nTens place:40-49, but only 40 is within 1-40, but 40's tens digit is 4, not 8. Wait, so in 1-40, the tens digit 8 doesn't appear because 80-89 is beyond 40. So, tens place 8's:0.\n\nTotal 8's:4.\n\nDifference:5-4=1.\n\nWait, but according to my method:\n\nUnits 4's: floor(40/10)=4, and since 40 mod10=0, which is less than 4? Wait, no, 40 mod10=0, which is less than 4, so we don't add 1. So, units 4's:4.\n\nTens 4's: floor(40/100)=0, but wait, 40/100=0.4, so floor is 0. Then, in the remaining 40 numbers, the tens digit is 4 for 40-40, which is 1 time. So, tens 4's:1.\n\nTotal 4's:4+1=5.\n\nUnits 8's: floor(40/10)=4, since 40 mod10=0, which is less than 8, so we don't add 1. So, units 8's:4.\n\nTens 8's: floor(40/100)=0, and in the remaining 40 numbers, the tens digit is 8 only if we have 80-89, which we don't, so tens 8's:0.\n\nTotal 8's:4+0=4.\n\nDifference:5-4=1, which matches manual counting. So, my method works here.\n\nSimilarly, let's test another example. Let's say 50 pages.\n\n4's:\n\nUnits:5 (4,14,24,34,44).\n\nTens:50-59, but we only go up to 50, so tens digit 4 appears once (40-49). So, tens 4's:10 (from 40-49). Wait, no, wait, in 1-50, the tens digit 4 is from 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\nWait, no, wait, 40-49 is 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place, so that's 10 4's.\n\nUnits 4's:5 (4,14,24,34,44).\n\nTotal 4's:5+10=15.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits:5 (8,18,28,38,48).\n\nTens:40-49 has tens digit 4, not 8, so tens 8's:0.\n\nTotal 8's:5.\n\nDifference:15-5=10.\n\nUsing my method:\n\nUnits 4's: floor(50/10)=5, 50 mod10=0 <4, so no addition. So, 5.\n\nTens 4's: floor(50/100)=0, remaining 50 numbers. The tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, 10.\n\nHundreds 4's:0.\n\nTotal 4's:5+10=15.\n\nUnits 8's: floor(50/10)=5, 50 mod10=0 <8, so no addition. So, 5.\n\nTens 8's: floor(50/100)=0, remaining 50 numbers. Tens digit 8 would be 80-89, which is beyond 50, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's:5.\n\nDifference:15-5=10. Correct.\n\nSo, my method works here as well.\n\nTherefore, applying this method to the original problem:\n\nTotal 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think I made a mistake earlier by not correctly calculating the units place for 4's, thinking it was 48 instead of 49. Now, after verifying with smaller examples, I'm confident that the correct difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - In every block of 10 numbers, '4' appears once in the units place.\n     - Number of complete blocks: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.\n     - Last partial block (481-488) includes 484, adding 1 more.\n     - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - In every block of 100 numbers, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place.\n     - Number of complete blocks: 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.\n     - 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n     - Last partial block (401-488) includes 440-449, adding 10 more.\n     - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - Pages 400-488 each have '4' in the hundreds place.\n     - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n     - Total: 89.\n\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - In every block of 10 numbers, '8' appears once in the units place.\n     - Number of complete blocks: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.\n     - Last partial block (481-488) includes 488, adding 1 more.\n     - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - In every block of 100 numbers, '8' appears 10 times in the tens place.\n     - Number of complete blocks: 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.\n     - 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n     - Last partial block (401-488) includes 480-488, adding 9 more.\n     - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - Pages 800-888 would have '8' in the hundreds place, but the book ends at 488.\n     - Total: 0.\n\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188.\n   - Number of '8's: 98.\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.  \n\\boxed{90}"

After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each position and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For each complete set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8 (8, 18, 28, etc.). \n\nNow, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and a partial set of 8 numbers (481-488). \n\nIn each complete set, the units digit 4 appears once, so for 48 sets, that's 48 times. Similarly, 8 appears 48 times in the units place from the complete sets. Now, the partial set from 481-488: the units digits here are 1 through 8. So, in this partial set, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). \n\nSo, total 4's in the units place: 48 (from complete sets) + 1 (from partial set) = 49.\nTotal 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the difference here is zero. Hmm, but I might be missing something because 488 is a three-digit number, so maybe I should check higher digit places as well.\n\nMoving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. Similarly, in 101-200, the tens digit cycles again from 0 to 9, and so on.\n\nIn each set of 100 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So, for the digit 4, it appears 10 times in the tens place for each 100 numbers, same for 8.\n\nNow, how many complete sets of 100 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial set from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete set of 100, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4 sets give 4*10=40 times. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times per set, so 40 times as well.\n\nNow, the partial set from 401-488: the tens digit here goes from 0 to 8. So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-490). But since we're only going up to 488, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears once in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, but since our range is 401-488, that's a full 10 numbers. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in 401-410, but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, actually, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 occurs in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in 481-488.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), up to 8 (481-490). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, the number of times each digit appears is 10 except for the last one, which is only 8 numbers because 488 is the last page.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears once in the 40s (441-450), which is 10 times, so that's 10 occurrences. Similarly, 8 appears once in the 80s (481-490), but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 numbers, so 8 occurrences.\n\nWait, but wait, 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 8 times. So, in the partial set from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in the tens place: 4 sets * 10 = 40, plus 10 from the partial set, so 50.\n\nTotal 8's in the tens place: 4 sets * 10 = 40, plus 8 from the partial set, so 48.\n\nWait, so 50 for 4's and 48 for 8's in the tens place. That's a difference of 2.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Each complete set of 100 contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 sets would be 40 each. Then, in the partial set, 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 more 4's, making it 50. For 8's, the tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 more, making it 48. So yes, 50 vs 48, difference of 2.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit, pages 100-199 have a hundreds digit of 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nSo, let's count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n\nFor 4's: The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488. How many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nFor 8's: The hundreds digit is 8 in pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89\nTotal 8's in hundreds place: 0\nDifference here is 89 - 0 = 89.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- Each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once in units place. There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 480 pages, so 48 each. Then, 481-488 is 8 pages, so units digits 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, 48 +1 =49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each 100 pages, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times per 100 pages. 4 sets of 100 (1-400) gives 40 each. Then, from 401-488, which is 88 pages. The tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490). So, in the tens place, 4 appears once (441-450), which is 10 times, so 10 more 4's, making it 50. 8 appears once in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, that's 8 numbers, so 8 more 8's, making it 48. So, 50 vs 48. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 doesn't appear at all. So, 89 vs 0.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for 401-488. Let me recount that.\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times except for the last one, which is only 8 times because 488 is the last page.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 pages, right? 488 - 400 = 88, so 88 pages. So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears how many times?\n\nEach tens digit from 0 to 8 in the tens place would cover 10 pages each, except the last one, which is cut short.\n\nWait, 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 pages\n411-420: tens digit 1, 10 pages\n...\n481-490: tens digit 8, but since we only go up to 488, that's 8 pages.\n\nSo, for each tens digit from 0 to 7, there are 10 pages each, and for 8, it's 8 pages.\n\nTherefore, in 401-488:\n\n- Tens digit 4: occurs in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times.\n- Tens digit 8: occurs in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times.\n\nSo, that part is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, how many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because when I first thought about it, I thought the difference might be 91, but I want to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nCalculating the number of 4's:\n\n- Units place: For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 480, so 48, plus 484, so 49.\n- Tens place: For every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. There are 4 complete sets (1-400), so 4*10=40, plus in 401-488, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (441-450), so total 50.\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nCalculating the number of 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49 as before.\n- Tens place: 48 as before.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 91.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times 8 appears, then subtract the two to find the difference. Let me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, etc. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each complete group, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit is 1-8, so no 4's there. So, units place gives us 48 fours.\n\nNext, the tens place: For the tens digit, a 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more numbers (401-488). In each complete block, there are 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 blocks give us 4*10=40 fours. Now, in the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 1 for 410-419, 2 for 420-429, 3 for 430-439, 4 for 440-449, 5 for 450-459, 6 for 460-469, 7 for 470-479, and 8 for 480-488. So, in this partial block, the tens digit is 4 only from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 fours. So total for tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 fours.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, that's 89 fours.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 400 to 488, each number has a hundreds digit of 4, so yes, 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10? 48 complete groups, each contributing 1 eight, so 48 eights. The last 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so the 8 in units place occurs once more at 488. So, units place gives 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\nWait, actually, wait: When I have 488, the units digit is 8, so yes, that's one more. So, units place: 48*1 +1=49.\n\nNext, tens place: For the tens digit, 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers. So, each complete block of 100 contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many complete blocks are there? From 1-400, we have 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 40 +9=49 eights.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens: 49, so total 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 fours minus 98 eights is 89.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, fours:\n\nUnits place: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete tens, each contributing 1 four, so 48. The last 8 numbers (481-488) don't add any fours in units place, so 48 fours.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, there's a block of 10 where tens digit is 4. From 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each giving 10 fours, so 40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. Total tens: 50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in hundreds place, so 89.\n\nTotal fours: 48 +50 +89= 187.\n\nEights:\n\nUnits place: 48 complete tens, each with one 8, so 48. Plus, in 488, units digit is 8, so +1, total 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has a block of 10 where tens digit is 8. From 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each giving 10 eights, so 40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. Total tens: 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal eights: 49 +49=98.\n\nSo, 187 fours -98 eights=89.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 89 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** Every 10 numbers contribute 1 '4'. There are 48 complete groups of 10 in 488, giving 48 '4's. The last 8 numbers (481-488) don't add any, so total 48.\n2. **Tens place:** Every 100 numbers have a block of 10 where the tens digit is '4'. From 1-400, there are 4 such blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), contributing 4\u00d710=40 '4's. From 401-488, the tens digit is '4' in 440-449 (10 numbers), adding 10. Total: 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, each number has a hundreds digit of '4', contributing 89 '4's.\n\nTotal '4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** Every 10 numbers contribute 1 '8'. There are 48 complete groups, giving 48 '8's. Additionally, 488 adds 1 more, totaling 49.\n2. **Tens place:** Every 100 numbers have a block of 10 where the tens digit is '8'. From 1-400, there are 4 such blocks, contributing 4\u00d710=40 '8's. From 401-488, the tens digit is '8' in 480-488 (9 numbers), adding 9. Total: 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have a hundreds digit of '8' since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal '8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, the units place. For every ten numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 more numbers. So, in each set of ten, the 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all ten numbers. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see, each hundred has one such block. So, from 1-100, there's 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then from 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249 and 340-349. Now, in the 400s, it's 400-409, but wait, the book goes up to 488, so 400-409 is only 10 numbers, but 410-488 would have 410-419 as another block, right? Wait, no, 400-409 is one block, 410-419 is another, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many complete blocks are there? Let me count: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, and 480-488. Wait, that's 13 blocks, but actually, each hundred has 10 blocks, but in the 400s, we have 9 blocks because the last one is cut short. Wait, no, actually, each hundred from 1-100, 101-200, etc., has one block in the tens place for 4. So, 100 pages would have 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, how many tens blocks with 4? The next block after 400-409 would be 410-419, which is another 10, then 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, and then 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers. So, how many complete blocks are there beyond 400? Let me see: 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, and 480-488. That's 8 more blocks, each contributing 10 except the last one which contributes 9. So, 7 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 7*10 + 9 = 79. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because from 400-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently.\n\nThe tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers. So, from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, how many more tens digits are 4? Let's see, 410-419 is another 10, 420-429 another 10, and so on up to 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many complete 10s are there after 400? Let's see, 410-419 is 10, 420-429 is 10, 430-439 is 10, 440-449 is 10, 450-459 is 10, 460-469 is 10, 470-479 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So that's 7 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, so 7*10 + 9 = 79. But wait, that would mean from 401-488, there are 79 numbers where the tens digit is 4, but that can't be right because 488 - 400 = 88, so 88 numbers, but we're only counting the tens digit. Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to calculate the number of times 4 appears in the tens place as follows: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers. So, from 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40. Now, from 401-488, how many more times does the tens digit equal 4? Let's see, 410-419 is 10, 420-429 is another 10, and so on. So, from 401 to 488, how many full tens blocks are there? Let's see, 401-488 is 88 numbers. The tens digit is 4 in 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, and 480-488. So that's 8 blocks where the tens digit is 4. Each of the first 7 blocks is 10 numbers, and the last block is 9 numbers. So, 7*10 + 9 = 79. Wait, but 79 seems too high because from 401-488, which is 88 numbers, the tens digit being 4 occurs 8 times, each time for 10 numbers except the last one which is 9. So, actually, it's 8 blocks, each contributing 10 except the last, which is 9. So, 7*10 + 9 = 79? Wait, no, that's not right because 410-419 is the first block after 400, then 420-429, etc., up to 480-488. So, how many blocks? Let's count them: 410-419 (10), 420-429 (10), 430-439 (10), 440-449 (10), 450-459 (10), 460-469 (10), 470-479 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 8 blocks. So, 7 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, totaling 7*10 + 9 = 79. But wait, 488 is the last page, so from 401-488, that's 88 numbers. The number of times the tens digit is 4 is 8 times, each for 10 numbers except the last one, which is 9. So, 7*10 + 9 = 79? Wait, that can't be because 79 is more than the 88 numbers available. Wait, no, actually, each block is 10 numbers, so 8 blocks would be 80 numbers, but since the last block is only 9 numbers, it's 79. But that would mean that in the tens place, from 401-488, the digit 4 appears 79 times? That seems too high because in reality, each block of 100 has 10 instances where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-400, it's 4*10=40. From 401-488, which is 88 numbers, how many times does the tens digit equal 4? Well, the tens digit cycles every 100, so in 88 numbers, how many full cycles of 100 are there? Wait, no, 401-488 is within the 400-499 range, so the tens digit cycles as usual. So, the number of times the tens digit is 4 in 401-488 would be the same as in 1-88, right? Because 401-488 is the same as 1-88 in the tens digit cycle. So, in 1-88, how many times does the tens digit equal 4? From 40-49, which is 10 numbers, and then from 140-149, but wait, no, in 1-88, the tens digit is 4 only once, from 40-49. So, that's 10 times. Wait, but 401-488 is 88 numbers, so the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in 88 numbers, how many times does the tens digit equal 4? It would be 8 full cycles (80 numbers) plus 8 more. In each cycle, the tens digit is 4 once, so 8 times from the full cycles, and then in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the tens digit is 8, so no additional 4's. So, total 8 times. So, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 8*10 + 0 = 80? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, in each set of 100, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. But we're only going up to 488, which is 88 numbers beyond 400. So, how many full tens blocks are there? From 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in 88 numbers, how many full tens blocks are there? 88 / 10 = 8.8, so 8 full blocks and 8 extra numbers. Each full block contributes 1 time where the tens digit is 4, so 8 times. The extra 8 numbers would be 480-488, where the tens digit is 8, so no additional 4's. So, total 8 times. Therefore, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 8 times, each contributing 10 numbers, so 8*10=80? Wait, that can't be because 88 numbers can't have 80 numbers where the tens digit is 4. I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. The number of times the tens digit is 4 in the entire range 1-488 is equal to the number of times it appears in each hundred. So, for each hundred, it's 10 times. So, 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) each contribute 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, how many times does the tens digit equal 4? Let's see, the tens digit cycles every 100, so in 401-488, which is 88 numbers, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (410-419), 10 numbers (420-429), 10 numbers (430-439), 10 numbers (440-449), 10 numbers (450-459), 10 numbers (460-469), 10 numbers (470-479), and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, that's 7 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 7*10=70 and 1*9=9, but wait, no, the tens digit being 4 is only in the blocks where the tens digit is 4, which are 410-419, 420-429, etc., each contributing 10 numbers. So, from 401-488, how many such blocks are there? Let's see, 410-419 is one, 420-429 is another, up to 470-479, which is 7 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 7*10=70. Then, 480-488 is the next block, but the tens digit is 8, so no 4's there. So, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 70 numbers. Therefore, total tens digit 4's from 1-488 would be 40 (from 1-400) + 70 (from 401-488) = 110. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, from 1-400, the tens digit is 4 for 4*10=40 times. From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 7*10=70 times, as there are 7 blocks of 10 where the tens digit is 4. So, total tens digit 4's would be 40 + 70 = 110. But wait, 401-488 is 88 numbers, and 7 blocks of 10 would be 70 numbers, which is correct because 70 is less than 88. So, yes, 70 more 4's in the tens place from 401-488. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 70 = 110.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 70 times, but when I think about it, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so from 1-400, that's 4*10=40. From 401-488, which is 88 numbers, how many full blocks of 100 are there? None, because 88 is less than 100. So, in 88 numbers, how many times does the tens digit equal 4? It's the same as in 1-88, which is once (40-49), so 10 times. But wait, that contradicts what I thought earlier. I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use a formula. The number of times a digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to n can be calculated as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number as ABC (hundreds, tens, units). For the tens place, we can consider the higher digits and the lower digits.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to break it down by each digit place separately.\n\nSo, for the tens place, the number of times 4 appears is calculated by:\n\n- For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\n- So, for 488 pages, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 times, so 4*10=40.\n\n- Now, from 401-488, how many times does the tens digit equal 4? Let's see, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479. That's 7 blocks, each of 10 numbers, so 7*10=70.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is only 88 numbers, so 7 blocks of 10 would take us up to 470-479, which is 479, and then 480-488 is the remaining 9 numbers, where the tens digit is 8. So, yes, 7 blocks of 10, so 70 times. Therefore, total tens digit 4's: 40 + 70 = 110.\n\nWait, but that seems too high because from 1-488, the tens digit 4 appears 110 times? Let me check with a smaller number. Let's say from 1-100, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49). From 1-200, it's 20 times, and so on. So, from 1-400, it's 40 times. From 401-488, it's 70 times. So, total 110 times. That seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is the sum of units, tens, and hundreds places:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 110\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 110 + 89 = let's see, 49 + 110 = 159, plus 89 is 248.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, units place: from 1-488, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9, so 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), where 484 has a 4 in the units place. So, units digit 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: as calculated, 110. Hmm.\n\nHundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 110 + 89 = 248.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4's, in the units place, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\n488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), where 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, units digit 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. How many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nAgain, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times, so 8 appears 10 times in each hundred. From 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40.\n\nFrom 401-488, how many times does the tens digit equal 8? Let's see, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, from 401-488, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total tens digit 8's: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds digit 8's: 0.\n\nTherefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because from 1-488, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800 or above, which doesn't happen here, so 0. So, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 1-400, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's: 248, total 8's: 98. So, 248 - 98 = 150.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, earlier I thought total 4's were 248, but let me recount:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 110\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 110 = 159, plus 89 is 248. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 98. Correct.\n\nSo, 248 - 98 = 150. So, there are 150 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 248 seems high for 4's. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the tens place for 4's. Let me recount the tens digit 4's.\n\nFrom 1-400:\n\nEach hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, 4 hundreds, 10 each: 40.\n\nFrom 401-488:\n\nThe tens digit is 4 in 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479. That's 7 blocks, each contributing 10, so 70.\n\nSo, total tens digit 4's: 40 + 70 = 110. Correct.\n\nHundreds digit 4's: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nUnits digit 4's: 49. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 110 + 89 = 248.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits digit: 49.\n\nTens digit: 49.\n\nHundreds digit: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 98.\n\nSo, 248 - 98 = 150.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 150 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 248, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 150 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{150}$"

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each complete set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is one of them, which adds another 4. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place in every block of 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, in 140-149, and 240-249, and 340-349. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49 is the first block, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and then 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another block. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, so that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4, so that's 89 4's. \n\nWait, but let me check that. From 400 to 488, each number's hundreds digit is 4, so yes, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units place is 49, tens place is 50, hundreds place is 89. So total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is one of them, which adds another 8. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such blocks are there up to 488. 80-89 is one, 180-189 is another, 280-289, 380-389. So that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-489 would be another block, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers, so that's 9 more 8's. So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify: The blocks I considered earlier (80-89, 180-189, etc.) each contribute 10 8's. But in the hundreds place, 480-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit from 480-488 is 8 for all 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 additional 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 9, so 49.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so that's 9 8's in the tens place, but in the hundreds place, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range. So, maybe I should consider that separately.\n\nWait, let me think again. The tens digit is 8 in the following ranges:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers\n\nSo, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, so total 4*10 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, the hundreds place doesn't contribute any 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's are units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so 98 total 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the tens place was 49, but let me recount. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was counting 4's, I had 188 4's. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. So, 4's are printed 90 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check my counting again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: For each 10 numbers, one 4. From 1-488, how many 4's in units place?\n\nNumber of complete decades: 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial decade (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included, which is one more 4. So, 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488: how many numbers? 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89= 188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nUnits place: same as 4's, 48 complete decades, 48 8's, plus in the last partial decade, 488 is included, so one more, total 49.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 800-899: but book ends at 488, so none.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49=98.\n\nSo, difference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 4's are printed 90 times more than 8's.\n\nBut let me think again: is there any chance I double-counted or missed something?\n\nWait, in the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place for 4's, 5 blocks of 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 49. Correct.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 49, tens place:49. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI think the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8, then find the difference between the two totals. Let me start by counting the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block, the digit 4 appears once, and the same goes for 8. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks and then a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). \n\nSo, in each full block, we have one 4 and one 8 in the units place. That would be 48 times each. Now, in the partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, we have a 4 on page 484 and an 8 on page 488. So, that's one 4 and one 8. \n\nAdding that up, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, the total number of 8's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49. So, so far, they're equal.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, the tens digits go from 0-9 ten times each. So, in the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. \n\nIn the case of 488 pages, we have four hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and then 400-488. Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds go up to 400-488. \n\nLet me correct that: from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's five blocks. But the first block is 1-99, since page 1 is the first page. Wait, actually, page 1 is just 1, so maybe I should consider 1-99 as the first block, but perhaps it's easier to think of 0-99 as the first block, even though page 0 doesn't exist. Hmm, maybe I should adjust for that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many times each digit appears in the tens place. For each hundred block, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 ten times. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. \n\nBut wait, the last block is only 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 and 8 appear? Let me think. \n\nFrom 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 0 for 400-409, 1 for 410-419, up to 8 for 480-488. \n\nSo, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449. That's 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 in the tens place appears in pages 480-488, which is 9 times because 480-488 is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, actually, 480-488 is 9 pages because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the last block.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of 4's in the tens place. For each full hundred block (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each. So that's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 times. Plus the 10 times in the 400-488 block, so total 50 times. \n\nWait, but hold on. The first block is 1-99, right? So, in 1-99, the tens digit 4 appears from 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, in 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10 times. Same for 200-299 and 300-399. So that's 4\u00d710=40. Then in 400-488, it's 440-449, another 10 times. So total 50 times for 4 in the tens place.\n\nNow for 8 in the tens place: in each of the first four hundred blocks (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit 8 appears 10 times each, so 4\u00d710=40. Then in the last block, 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 times, as I thought earlier. So total 40 + 9 = 49 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo, so far, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. So, 4 is ahead by 1 so far.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, let's see how many times each digit appears in the hundreds place.\n\nFor 4: It appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 times.\n\nFor 8: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit 8 never appears. So, 0 times.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times and 8 appears 0 times. So, that's a big difference.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place: 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing 1 to 4 and 1 to 8. Then, the last block from 481-488 adds one more 4 and one more 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For each hundred block (1-99, 100-199, etc.), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each, so 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. Plus 10 in 400-488, total 50. For 8, same for the first four blocks: 4\u00d710=40, plus 9 in 400-488, total 49. That seems right.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times. Correct.\n\nAdding up: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188; 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Difference is 90. Hmm, that seems high, but considering the hundreds place contributes a lot, maybe it's correct.\n\nWait, let me think again. In the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times because from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages. Each of those pages has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is indeed 90.

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\n1. **Units place (4's):** For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4); from 11-20, 4 appears once (page 14), and so on. \n\n   Now, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, I'll take the integer part, which is 48 full groups. Each of these contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is actually the last page, so the last group is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the 48th group ends at 480, and the 49th group is 481-490, but we only go up to 488. So, in the 49th group, from 481-488, the units digit 4 appears once (page 484). So, actually, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 (from 481-488), totaling 49.\n\n2. **Tens place (4's):** Similarly, for the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 10 numbers every 100 pages. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. \n\n   Now, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? That's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\n   For each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. \n\n   Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 from 440-449. That's another 10 times. So, adding that, we have 40 + 10 = 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (4's):** The hundreds digit is 4 only for pages 400-488. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\n   Wait, let me check that. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So yes, 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNext, I need to count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same process.\n\n1. **Units place (8's):** Similar to the 4's, every group of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. From 1-10, 8 appears once (page 8); 11-20, once (page 18), etc. \n\n   So, how many full groups of 10 are there in 488? As before, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. That's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (page 488). So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place (8's):** For the tens digit, 8 appears in a block of 10 numbers every 100 pages, such as 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\n   How many hundreds are there in 488? Four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\n   For each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times each, so 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\n   Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears from 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but 488 is the last page. So, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\n   Wait, but earlier I thought each block is 10 numbers, but in this case, it's only 9 because we stop at 488. So, total tens place 8's are 40 (from the first four hundreds) plus 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (8's):** The hundreds digit is 8 only for pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no pages where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 occurrences.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the tens place count for 8's. So, in the first four hundreds, each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 more. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the first four hundreds, for each hundred, the tens digit 8 occurs in 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 10 per hundred, 4 hundreds, so 40. Then, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. So, total 8's in tens place is 49.\n\nSimilarly, units place: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus one more in 488, so 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's total was 188, and 8's is 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's. Units place: from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times in units place.\n\nTens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. Wait, but earlier I thought only four full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus 440-449 in the 400s, which is another 10, so 40 + 10 =50. So, yes, 50 in tens place.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The last term is 488. So, 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 times.\n\nTens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Wait, that's five blocks, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, not 10. So, for the first four hundreds, each has 10 8's in tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 400s, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 =49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 +49 +0=98.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier that in the tens place for 8's, it's 49, but let me confirm. From 1-400, how many 8's in tens place? Each hundred has 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 40 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, units place: 49.\n\nSo, 49+49=98.\n\nYes, so the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I didn't miss any 8's in the hundreds place. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488 and less than 4 otherwise. So, no 8's in hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times in each block of 100, totaling 50 times (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears 10 times in each block of 100, plus 9 times in 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 times.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI think I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Maybe I can count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and do the same for 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once as well. \n\nNow, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of 10, and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488). In each of these 48 sets, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, that's 48 fours and 48 eights. \n\nNow, looking at the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial set, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484), and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding that to our counts, we have 48 + 1 = 49 fours and 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place. Wait, no, that can't be right because 488 is the last page. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, the last page is 488, so the extra pages after 480 are 481 to 488, which is 8 pages. So, the units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in these, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, for the units place, total fours are 48 (from the complete sets) +1 =49, and eights are 48 +1=49. Hmm, so in the units place, the number of 4's and 8's are the same, 49 each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, the pattern repeats every 100 pages. Each group of 100 pages has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 4 (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.) and similarly 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 8 (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.). \n\nSo, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages and 8 for another 10 pages. So, for each hundred, 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 fours and 4*10=40 eights. \n\nNow, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 in the tens place. Let me think about how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. \n\nFrom 401-409: tens digit is 0, so no 4 or 8 here.\nFrom 410-419: tens digit is 1, so no.\nFrom 420-429: tens digit is 2, no.\n430-439: tens digit is 3, no.\n440-449: tens digit is 4. So, that's 10 pages where the tens digit is 4.\n450-459: tens digit is 5, no.\n460-469: tens digit is 6, no.\n470-479: tens digit is 7, no.\n480-488: tens digit is 8. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages where the tens digit is 8.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 pages because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, in the tens place, in the remaining 88 pages, we have 10 fours (from 440-449) and 9 eights (from 480-488). \n\nSo, adding to our earlier counts: fours in tens place are 40 +10=50, and eights in tens place are 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages, and 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So yes, 10 fours and 9 eights in the tens place of the remaining 88 pages. So, total for tens place: 50 fours and 49 eights.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488, right? Because the book goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, meaning the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAs for the digit 8 in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total eights from total fours: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n- Each 10 pages: 1 four and 1 eight. 488 pages mean 48 complete sets of 10, so 48 fours and 48 eights. Then the remaining 8 pages (481-488) add 1 four (484) and 1 eight (488). So, 49 fours and 49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each 100 pages: 10 fours and 10 eights. 4 complete hundreds give 40 fours and 40 eights. The remaining 88 pages (401-488) have 10 fours (440-449) and 9 eights (480-488). So, 50 fours and 49 eights. That adds up correctly.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 49 +50 +89 = 188\nTotal eights: 49 +49 +0 =98\nDifference: 188 -98 =90\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves counting how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately, we find that the digit 4 appears 188 times and the digit 8 appears 98 times. Subtracting these gives a difference of 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the best way to approach this is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (at page 4). Similarly, from 11-20, 4 appears once at page 14, and so on.\n\nSo, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). In each complete block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once at page 484. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a block of 10 numbers every 100 pages. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, this happens in 140-149, 240-249, etc.\n\nLet me figure out how many times this happens. Each time, it's a block of 10 pages. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, which means there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 pages (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so that's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 times. Now, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449. That's another 10 pages. So, total 4's in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but I should check if 440-449 are within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. So, how many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. Therefore, 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, in each block of 10, one 8. There are 48 complete blocks of 10 in 488, so 48 times. The partial block is 481-488, which has units digits from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once at page 488. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 pages. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes 10 pages where the tens digit is 8.\n\nHow many such blocks are there? Each block is 100 pages, so 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, meaning 4 complete hundreds. So, 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 times. Now, in the partial hundred (401-488), does the tens digit 8 appear? Let's see: pages 480-489 would have tens digit 8, but since the book ends at 488, that's pages 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages here. Therefore, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, is that right? Because from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So yes, 9 times. So, total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be for pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 48 complete blocks \u00d71 + 1 in the last partial block = 49. Tens place: 4 complete blocks \u00d710 = 40, plus 9 in the partial block, totaling 49. Hundreds place: 0. So, yes, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, total 4's are 188, total 8's are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 complete blocks (each contributing 1) + 1 in the last 8 pages (484) = 49.\n- Tens place: 4 complete hundreds (each contributing 10) + 10 in the partial hundred (440-449) = 50.\n- Hundreds place: 89 pages (400-488) = 89.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nCounting 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 complete blocks + 1 in the last 8 pages (488) = 49.\n- Tens place: 4 complete hundreds \u00d710 = 40, plus 9 in the last partial hundred (480-488) = 49.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in the blocks 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last one contributes 9. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, we have 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last one contributes 10, as 440-449 is within 488. So, 4\u00d710 +10=50. That's correct.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place for 4's, 400-488 is 89 pages, which is correct because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89.\n\nAnd for 8's, hundreds place is 0 because 800 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, the calculations seem correct. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit surprised it's 90. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nAnd for 8's, no hundreds place, so 0. So, yes, 98 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. For 4's, each block of 10 has one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once at 484. So, 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, same logic: 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1, plus 1 in the last 8 pages at 488. So, 49.\n\nSo, yes, the counts seem correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 complete blocks of 10 (480 numbers) and a partial block of 8 (481-488). Thus, 48 + 1 = 49 fours.\n   - **Tens place:** Every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). There are 4 complete hundreds (400 numbers) and a partial hundred (401-488) where 4 appears 10 times (440-449). Thus, 4\u00d710 +10=50 fours.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, 4 appears in the hundreds place for 89 pages.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 +1=49 eights.\n   - **Tens place:** Every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. There are 4 complete hundreds and a partial hundred (480-488) contributing 9 eights. Thus, 4\u00d710 +9=49 eights.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No pages with 8 in the hundreds place (pages 800-899 are beyond 488).\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll go through each position one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place (the first digit from the right):** \n   - In the units place, the digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484.\n   - So, I can calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place by dividing the total number of pages by 10. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that would mean 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the 48th group would end at 480, so the next group would be 481-490, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last group is incomplete. So, how many 4's are there in the units place? Let's see: from 1 to 488, every 10 pages, 4 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full times, but since 488 is the last page, the 48th occurrence would be at 484, and then 494 would be beyond 488, so actually, it's 48 times in the units place for 4. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last 4 in the units place before 488. So, 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place (the second digit from the right):**\n   - In the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449.\n   - But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last group in the tens place for 4 would be 440-449, which is within 488. So, how many full hundreds are there? 488 is less than 500, so we have four hundreds: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, no, 400-488 is the fourth hundred, but let me think differently. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, from 1-400, there are four hundreds, each contributing 10 occurrences, so 4*10=40. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 times, so that's 10 more. So total in the tens place for 4 is 40 + 10 = 50? Wait, no, because 400-488 is part of the fourth hundred. Wait, maybe I should calculate it as:\n\n   - For the tens place, the number of times 4 appears can be calculated as:\n     - For each hundred block (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.), the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n     - There are 4 full hundreds in 488 (since 488 is less than 500, so 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488). Wait, that's actually 5 blocks, but 401-488 is not a full hundred. So, in each full hundred (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each, so 4*10=40 times. Now, in the last block, 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (the third digit from the right):**\n   - In the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in the numbers 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. But wait, no, because 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400 is the first, 401, 402,..., up to 488. So yes, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds.\n\nUnits: 48\n\nTens: 50\n\nHundreds: 89\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, let me double-check that.\n\nWait, in the units place, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, but since 488 is included, does that mean 48 or 49? Let me think: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, the last number with 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times.\n\nIn the tens place, as I calculated, 50 times.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 89 times.\n\nSo, 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similarly, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, but let's check: the last number with 8 in the units place is 488, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, because 8, 18, 28,..., 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? The first is 8 (1st), then 18 (2nd), up to 488, which is the (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49th occurrence. So, units place for 8 is 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In the tens place, 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Let's see how many full hundreds we have. From 1-488, the hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488.\n   - In each full hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89 in 1-100, 180-189 in 101-200, etc.). So, 4 full hundreds contribute 4*10=40 times.\n   - Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 for all these, so that's 9 times.\n   - So total in the tens place for 8 is 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds.\n\nUnits: 49\n\nTens: 49\n\nHundreds: 0\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me check again.\n\nUnits place: 49 times.\n\nTens place: 49 times.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98.\n\nSo, how many more 4's than 8's? 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, in the units place for 4, I had 48 times, but for 8, it's 49 times. That makes sense because 488 is included, so 488 adds an extra 8 in the units place.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4, I had 50 times, and for 8, 49 times. Wait, why is that? Let me check again.\n\nFor 4 in the tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, each contributing 10 times, so 5*10=50 times. That's correct.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 sets, but the last set is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, 4 full sets of 10 (40) and 1 set of 9 (9), totaling 49. That's correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488), and 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, 4's total: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n8's total: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nSo, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, this happens 48 times (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, but we only count full occurrences up to 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes 10 occurrences. There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, this happens 49 times (including 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block contributes 10 occurrences. There are 4 full blocks and an incomplete block (480-488), totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 never appears as the hundreds digit in 1-488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many times does this happen? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Dividing 488 by 10 gives me 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10 and then a partial group of 8. But since we're only counting the units place, each group contributes one 4. So, 48 times in the units place, and then in the partial group (481-488), the units digit is 4 once (484). So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, no, actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning 48 full cycles and 8 extra numbers. Each full cycle contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Let's see how many such groups there are. From 1 to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\nWait, actually, the tens place cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, 4 hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 times. Wait, but 488 is less than 490, so 440-449 is within 401-488. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but hold on, 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, that's correct. So, total 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: similar to 4, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, the partial group from 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. So, that's another 8 in the units place (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers, such as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last group is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? Because 480 has 8 in the tens place, 481, 482, ..., 488 all have 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 numbers.\n\nSo, let's break it down. Each full hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has one group of 10 where the tens digit is 8. So, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 times the digit 8 in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nThen, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800 or above, but since the book ends at 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98. Hmm, but wait, when I calculated the 4's, I got 188, and 8's are 98, so 188 - 98 = 90 more 4's. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, in the tens place for 8's, I thought that in the last partial hundred, 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. But actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. So, 40 (from the four full hundreds) + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial group, which is 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, there's no page number with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I calculated the 4's, I had 49 in units, 50 in tens, and 89 in hundreds, totaling 188. For 8's, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, totaling 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. In the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me check the 4's in the tens place again. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Every hundred, 10 times. So, 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 times, so 40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 more. So, 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nSo, 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10 and a partial group of 8. Each full group contributes 1, totaling 48, plus 1 from the partial group, totaling 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 10 consecutive numbers every 100. There are 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, totaling 40. In the partial hundred (401-488), 440-449 adds another 10, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups plus 1 from the partial group, totaling 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 10 consecutive numbers every 100. There are 4 full hundreds contributing 40. In the partial hundred (401-488), 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the key here is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll need to check each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, I think we can say there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives me 48 fours. But wait, from 1 to 488, the last group is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, does that mean I need to check if 484 is within this range? Yes, 484 is within 480-488, so that's an extra 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's would be 48 (from the complete groups) plus 1 (from 484), making it 49.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Actually, for the units digit, it's every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra in the incomplete group. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, in each of the 48 complete decades, there's one 4, so 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So, actually, units place 4's are 48.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each cycle, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours. Now, in the incomplete cycle from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total units place 4's: 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. For the tens digit, 4 appears in a block of 10 numbers every 100. So, for example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4. Similarly, from 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488?\n\nLet me list them:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249: 10\n- 340-349: 10\n- 440-449: 10\n\nSo that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's fine.\n\nNow, are there any other tens digits with 4 beyond these blocks? Let me think. For example, in the hundreds place, if the hundreds digit is 4, then the tens digit could also be 4. But in our case, the blocks I listed already include all the tens digits being 4, regardless of the hundreds digit. So, I think that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in each of these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4, contributing one 4 each. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but wait a second. From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers, so that's 89 fours.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units: 48, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. Hmm, that seems high, but let me see.\n\nWait, but let me think about the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, yes, 89 is correct.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nAgain, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place: Similar to 4's, in each group of 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. That's 48. Then, in the last partial group, which is 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 8 appears once here (at 488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that's different from the 4's. So, units place 8's: 49.\n\nNow, tens place: 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers every 100. So, for example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last block. So, how many such blocks are there?\n\nLet me list them:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place, and the last block contributes 9 eights.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: (4 blocks * 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check: from 80-89, that's 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189, etc. So, 4 blocks of 10, which is 40, plus 480-488, which is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, yes, 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, so 4's: 187, 8's: 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because 89 more 4's than 8's seems significant.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. Let me go through that again.\n\nFor the hundreds place, 4's appear from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89. Then, in the tens place, I had 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 4's, so 50. And units place: 48. So, 89 + 50 + 48 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's, units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. I had 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks * 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the tens place, we have 5 blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers because the book ends at 488. So, 4 blocks of 10 and one of 9, totaling 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the 4's in the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times, plus in the last partial group, 481-488, the units digit 4 appears at 484. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, earlier I thought it was 48, but now I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nThe units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each complete group of 10, the units digit 4 appears once. So, from 1-10: 4 appears once (at 4). 11-20: once (at 14). And so on.\n\nSo, the number of complete groups of 10 in 488 is 48 (since 48*10=480). So, in each of these 48 groups, 4 appears once in the units place, so 48 times.\n\nNow, the remaining numbers are 481-488, which is 8 numbers. The units digits here are 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So, total units place 4's: 48.\n\nWait, so that contradicts my earlier thought where I thought 484 would add another 4. But 484 is in the range 480-488, but since 480 is the start of a new group, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so 480,481,...,488. So, in this group, the units digits are 0-8. So, 484 has a 4 in the units place, right? Because 484 is 4 in the units place.\n\nWait, but 480 is the start of the 49th group of 10, but since the book ends at 488, which is the 488th page, we only have 9 numbers in the last group. So, in this last group, 480-488, the units digits go from 0 to 8, so 484 is included, which has a 4 in the units place. So, that's an extra 4 in the units place beyond the 48 complete groups. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 48, but now I'm seeing it's 49. Which is correct?\n\nLet me think of it as:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(488 / 10) = 48. Each contributes one 4 in units place: 48.\n\nThen, the remaining numbers: 488 - (48 * 10) = 488 - 480 = 8 numbers: 481-488.\n\nIn these 8 numbers, the units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once at 484. So, units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSo, earlier I was wrong when I thought it was 48; it's actually 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: 488 / 10 = 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSo, correcting myself, units place 4's: 49, units place 8's: 49.\n\nNow, moving on to tens place for 4's: 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\nTens place for 8's: 5 blocks, but the last block is only 9 numbers, so 49.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 89.\n\nHundreds place for 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nWait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so now I'm getting 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but earlier I thought 89, but now it's 90. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me count the number of hundreds digits as 4. From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's total: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 187 - 98 = 89, but now it's 188 - 98 = 90. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial count of units place 4's.\n\nWait, let me recount the units place 4's:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIt's every 10 numbers, so:\n\nAt 4,14,24,...,484.\n\nSo, how many terms are there in this sequence?\n\nThe first term is 4, the last term is 484.\n\nThe common difference is 10.\n\nNumber of terms = ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSo, 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place:\n\n8,18,28,...,488.\n\nNumber of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSo, 49 times.\n\nSo, units place: 4's:49, 8's:49.\n\nTens place:\n\n4's: 5 blocks, each 10 numbers, so 50.\n\n8's: 5 blocks, but the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89, but now it's 90. I think I made a mistake in the initial count where I thought units place 4's were 48 instead of 49. So, correcting that, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again:\n\n4's:\n\n- Units:49\n\n- Tens:50\n\n- Hundreds:89\n\nTotal:49+50=99; 99+89=188.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units:49\n\n- Tens:49\n\n- Hundreds:0\n\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the tens place for 8's. So, from 80-89, that's 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 blocks, but the last block is only 9 numbers, so 9 instead of 10. So, 4 blocks of 10 (40) and 1 block of 9, totaling 49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, all blocks are complete: 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 10 numbers each. So, 5 blocks, 50.\n\nSo, yes, 50.\n\nAnd hundreds place for 4's is 89.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought it was 89, but now it's 90. Let me check with a smaller example to see if my method is correct.\n\nSuppose I have a book with 48 pages. Let's count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nPage numbers:1-48.\n\n4's:\n\nUnits place:4,14,24,34,44. That's 5 times.\n\nTens place:40-49, but since we only go up to 48, it's 40-48. So, 40-48 is 9 numbers, each with 4 in the tens place. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:5+9=14.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits place:8,18,28,38,48. That's 5 times.\n\nTens place:40-48: no, 80-89 is beyond 48, so only 8 in units place.\n\nSo, total 8's:5.\n\nDifference:14-5=9.\n\nWait, but according to my method:\n\nUnits place 4's: floor(48/10)=4, plus if the last partial group has 4 in units, which it does at 44. So, 4+1=5.\n\nTens place 4's: number of blocks where tens digit is 4. From 40-48, which is 9 numbers, so 9.\n\nTotal 4's:5+9=14.\n\nUnits place 8's: floor(48/10)=4, plus if last partial group has 8, which it does at 48. So, 4+1=5.\n\nTens place 8's: blocks are 80-89, which is beyond 48, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's:5+0=5.\n\nDifference:14-5=9, which matches.\n\nSo, my method seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the case of 488 pages, the difference is 90.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89, but after correcting the units place 4's, it's 49, leading to 188-98=90.\n\nYes, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n     - Total groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 complete groups, each contributing one '4'.\n     - In the last partial group (481-488), '4' appears once at 484.\n     - Total units place '4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   \n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - The digit '4' appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n     - Each block contributes 10 '4's in the tens place.\n     - Total tens place '4's: 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   \n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - The digit '4' appears in all numbers from 400 to 488.\n     - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n     - Total hundreds place '4's: 89.\n   \n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - The digit '8' appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n     - Total groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 complete groups, each contributing one '8'.\n     - In the last partial group (481-488), '8' appears once at 488.\n     - Total units place '8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   \n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - The digit '8' appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n     - The first four blocks contribute 10 '8's each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 '8's.\n     - Total tens place '8's: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 49.\n   \n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - The digit '8' does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n     - Total hundreds place '8's: 0.\n   \n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
