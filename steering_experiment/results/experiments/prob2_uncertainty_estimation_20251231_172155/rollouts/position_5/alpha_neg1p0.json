    "text": " \n\nI guess the first thing I should do is count how many times the digit 4 appears in each of these ranges and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have those totals, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each range separately: single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit pages.\n\nStarting with single-digit pages (1-9), the digit 4 appears exactly once, which is on page 4. So, that's one 4.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit pages (10-99). Here, I need to consider both the tens place and the units place separately. \n\nFor the tens place, the numbers from 40 to 49 all have a 4 in the tens digit. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nFor the units place, the 4 appears once in every set of ten numbers. So, in 10-19, it's page 14; in 20-29, it's page 24; and so on up to 90-99, which is page 94. That's 9 occurrences in the units place. Wait, but from 10-99, there are 9 sets of ten (10-19 up to 90-99), so 9 times. So, 9 more 4's in the units place.\n\nAdding that up, in two-digit pages, we have 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 occurrences of the digit 4.\n\nNow, onto the three-digit pages, which go from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because there are three places to consider: hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit 4 only goes up to 488, not 499. So, let's break this down.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n- Pages 100-199: The hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's here.\n- Pages 200-299: The hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's here.\n- Pages 300-399: The hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's here.\n- Pages 400-488: The hundreds digit is 4. Now, how many pages are there from 400 to 488? Let's see, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit cycles from 0-9 for each hundred. So, for each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. But since we're only going up to 488, we have to adjust for the last partial hundred.\n\nLet me think. From 100-399, each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, that's 3 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 3*10 = 30.\n\nNow, from 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? It's when the tens digit is 4, which is pages 440-449. That's 10 pages, so 10 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's 10 pages. So, adding that, from 400-488, we have 10 occurrences in the tens place.\n\nSo, total occurrences of 4 in the tens place in three-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 40.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. Similarly, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, in each ten, the units digit 4 appears once. Let's calculate this.\n\nFrom 100-399, each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 in the units place (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194; 204, 214, ..., 294; etc.). So, 3 hundreds * 10 = 30.\n\nFrom 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see, starting from 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 occurrences because 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last one with a units digit of 4.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs at 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times because 488 is the last page, so 488 isn't included. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total units place 4's in three-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 400-488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? The first one is 404, and the last is 484. The difference between 404 and 484 is 80, so 80/10 = 8 intervals, which would give 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 times. So, total units place 4's: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89 + 40 = 129, plus 39 is 168.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again. Hundreds place: 89, tens place: 40, units place: 39. So, 89 + 40 = 129, plus 39 is 168. So, 168 4's in three-digit pages.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify. From 100-399, each hundred contributes 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, how many 4's? In the hundreds place, none except for 400-488. In the tens place, 10 per hundred. In the units place, 10 per hundred. So, for 100-399, each hundred would have 10 (tens) + 10 (units) = 20 4's, times 3 hundreds, which is 60. Then, from 400-488, we have 89 in hundreds, 10 in tens, and 9 in units, totaling 89 + 10 + 9 = 108. So, total 4's would be 60 + 108 = 168. That matches, so I think that's correct.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's across all page numbers:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 = 20, plus 168 is 188.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 1 + 19 is 20, and 20 + 168 is 188. Hmm, but let me think again. Wait, in three-digit numbers, I had 168, which includes all three places. So, total 4's would be 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I need to count how many times 8 appears in each place across all page numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit pages (1-9). The digit 8 appears once, on page 8.\n\nNext, two-digit pages (10-99). Again, considering tens and units places.\n\nTens place: From 80-89, each of these 10 pages has an 8 in the tens place. So, that's 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: In each set of ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), the units digit 8 appears once. So, that's 9 occurrences (since from 10-99, there are 9 sets of ten, each contributing one 8 in the units place). Wait, but actually, from 10-99, there are 9 sets (10-19 up to 90-99), each with one 8 in the units place, so 9 times. So, units place: 9.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit pages: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nNow, onto three-digit pages (100-488). Again, hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place here, so 0 occurrences.\n\nTens place: In each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9. So, for each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times. Let's calculate this.\n\nFrom 100-399, each hundred has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, 380-389). So, 3 hundreds * 10 = 30.\n\nFrom 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, when the tens digit is 8, we have pages 480-488. But wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, right? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nWait, but actually, 480-488 is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488), so the tens digit is 8 for all of these, so that's 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's in three-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39.\n\nUnits place: Similarly, in each hundred, the units digit 8 appears once every ten numbers. So, from 100-399, each hundred contributes 10 occurrences (e.g., 108, 118, ..., 198; 208, 218, ..., 298; etc.), so 3 hundreds * 10 = 30.\n\nFrom 400-488, the units digit 8 appears in 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 occurrences because 488 is included.\n\nSo, total units place 8's in three-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 400-488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers starting from 408 up to 488. So, 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total units place 8's: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nAdding up all the 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place (39) + units place (39) = 78.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 8's across all page numbers:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 = 20, plus 78 is 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 1 + 19 is 20, and 20 + 78 is 98. Hmm, but let me check again.\n\nWait, in three-digit numbers, we had 39 in tens and 39 in units, so 78. Then, adding single and two-digit, 1 + 19 = 20, so total 20 + 78 = 98. So, 98 8's.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify. For three-digit numbers, hundreds place: 0, tens: 39, units: 39, so 78. Then, single-digit: 1, two-digit: 19, so total 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 188\nTotal 8's: 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n- Three-digit: hundreds (89) + tens (40) + units (39) = 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n- Three-digit: tens (39) + units (39) = 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I double-counted somewhere. Let me check the three-digit counts again.\n\nIn three-digit numbers, for 4's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 4's in hundreds place.\n- Tens place: 100-399: 3 hundreds * 10 = 30; 400-488: 10 (440-449), so 30 + 10 = 40.\n- Units place: 100-399: 3 * 10 = 30; 400-488: 404, 414, ..., 484, which is 9, so 30 + 9 = 39.\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 100-399: 3 * 10 = 30; 400-488: 480-488 is 9, so 30 + 9 = 39.\n- Units place: 100-399: 3 * 10 = 30; 400-488: 408, 418, ..., 488 is 9, so 30 + 9 = 39.\nTotal: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the difference is indeed 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that I included page 488 correctly? For the units place in three-digit 8's, I included 488, which is correct. For the tens place in three-digit 8's, I included 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Similarly, for 4's in the units place, I included up to 484, which is correct because 488 is beyond that.\n\nAnother way to check: maybe using a formula or another method to count the digits.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each digit place separately across all page numbers.\n\nFor the units place:\n\n- From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n- Similarly, how many times does 8 appear?\n\nSimilarly for tens and hundreds places.\n\nLet me try this approach.\n\nFor units place:\n\n- 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48 full groups, with 8 remaining numbers (481-488).\n\nIn each group of 10, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 * 1 = 48. Plus, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), does 4 appear in the units place? 484 is in there, so that's one more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 39 in three-digit units place and 9 in two-digit units place, totaling 48. Hmm, but this method is giving me 49. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's see: from 1-9, units digit 4 appears once (page 4). From 10-99, units digit 4 appears 9 times (14,24,...,94). From 100-488, units digit 4 appears how many times? Let's see, 100-109: 104; 110-119: 114; ...; 480-488: 484. So, how many decades are there from 100-488? 488 - 100 + 1 = 389 pages, which is 38 full decades (380 pages) and 9 pages. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Actually, from 100-488, the units digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so total number of times is floor(488/10) - floor(99/10) = 48 - 9 = 39. So, 39 times in three-digit units place. Adding the single-digit (1) and two-digit (9), total 1 + 9 + 39 = 49. So, that's correct. So, my earlier count was wrong because I thought two-digit units place was 9, but actually, from 10-99, units digit 4 appears 9 times, and single-digit once, so total 10, but when I added three-digit, I had 39, making total 49. But in my initial calculation, I had 39 in three-digit, 9 in two-digit, and 1 in single-digit, totaling 49. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place:\n\nFrom 1-9: once (page 8)\nFrom 10-99: 9 times (18,28,...,98)\nFrom 100-488: how many? Let's see, 100-488, units digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, floor(488/10) - floor(99/10) = 48 - 9 = 39. So, 39 times in three-digit units place. So, total 8's in units place: 1 + 9 + 39 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 39 in three-digit units place, 9 in two-digit, and 1 in single-digit, totaling 49. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in my initial count for 8's, I had 39 in three-digit units place, which is correct, but in my initial calculation, I had 30 from 100-399 and 9 from 400-488, totaling 39. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I did the initial count for 4's, I had 39 in three-digit units place, but when using this method, it's 39. So, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the total 4's were 188, which included 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit). But using this units place method, I see that units digit 4's are 49, which is 1 + 9 + 39.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- From 1-99: tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49)\n- From 100-488: tens digit 4 appears in 100-199: 140-149 (10 times), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10. So, total in three-digit tens place: 4 sets * 10 = 40. But wait, from 100-399, it's 3 sets (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10, so 30. Then, 400-488 contributes another 10 (440-449). So, total 40.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 10 (from 1-99) + 40 (from 100-488) = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place:\n\n- From 1-99: 10 times (80-89)\n- From 100-488: in each hundred, 10 times (180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488). Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, not 10. So, from 100-399: 3 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 30. From 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place: 10 (from 1-99) + 39 (from 100-488) = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I had for 4's in tens place: 10 (from 1-99) + 40 (from 100-488) = 50, which would mean total 4's in tens place is 50, but earlier I had 40 in three-digit tens place. Wait, no, in my initial count, I had 10 in two-digit tens place and 40 in three-digit tens place, totaling 50. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I did the initial count for 4's, I had in two-digit tens place: 10, and in three-digit tens place: 40, so total 50. Similarly, for 8's, tens place: 10 (two-digit) + 39 (three-digit) = 49.\n\nNow, for hundreds place:\n\n4's: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\n8's: hundreds digit never 8 in this book, since the highest is 488, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so that's consistent with my earlier calculation. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me check again because I'm a bit confused about the units place counts. Earlier, when I did the initial count, I thought units place 4's were 39 in three-digit, 9 in two-digit, and 1 in single-digit, totaling 49, which matches the per-place calculation.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, units place 39 in three-digit, 9 in two-digit, and 1 in single-digit, totaling 49.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** 1 occurrence (page 4).\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 10 occurrences (40-49).\n     - Units place: 9 occurrences (14, 24, ..., 94).\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: 89 occurrences (pages 400-488).\n     - Tens place: 40 occurrences (10-399: 3 sets of 10, and 400-488: 10).\n     - Units place: 39 occurrences (100-399: 3 sets of 10, and 400-488: 9).\n     - Total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n   - **Total 4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** 1 occurrence (page 8).\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 10 occurrences (80-89).\n     - Units place: 9 occurrences (18, 28, ..., 98).\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: 0 occurrences.\n     - Tens place: 39 occurrences (100-399: 3 sets of 10, and 400-488: 9).\n     - Units place: 39 occurrences (100-399: 3 sets of 10, and 400-488: 9).\n     - Total: 39 + 39 = 78.\n   - **Total 8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - More 4's than 8's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 appears 90 times more than the digit 8 in the page numbers.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, then find the difference between these two counts. Let me tackle the 4's first. \n\nStarting with single-digit pages: from 1 to 9. The digit 4 appears once, which is on page 4. The digit 8 appears once on page 8. So, in single-digit pages, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. That's a difference of zero so far.\n\nNext, let's move to two-digit pages: from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has two digits. I think I should consider the tens place and the units place separately. \n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers, the digits go from 1 to 9. So, the tens digit can be 1, 2, ..., up to 9. For the digit 4, the tens place will be 4 for pages 40-49. That's 10 pages, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, for the digit 8, the tens place will be 8 for pages 80-89, which is another 10 pages, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers. The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each ten. So, for each ten (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 tens in two-digit numbers (10-99), so the digit 4 appears 9 times in the units place. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the units place. \n\nWait, but actually, from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of ten. So, for each digit, in the units place, it appears 9 times. So, for 4's, that's 9 times, and for 8's, that's 9 times. \n\nSo, adding up the two-digit pages: 4's in tens place (10) + units place (9) = 19 times. 8's in tens place (10) + units place (9) = 19 times. So, in two-digit pages, 4's and 8's each appear 19 times. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit pages: from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complicated because now each page number has three digits: hundreds, tens, and units. I need to consider each place separately for both 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place. The hundreds digit for three-digit numbers can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book ends at 488. So, the hundreds digit goes from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. \n\nFor the digit 4 in the hundreds place: pages 400-488. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the hundreds place: but wait, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears zero times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, moving to the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9 for each hundred. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9, and for each digit, 4 and 8 will appear in their respective places.\n\nLet me break it down by each hundred:\n\n1. 100-199: Here, the hundreds digit is 1. The tens digit can be 0-9, and the units digit can be 0-9. So, for each tens digit, how many times does 4 and 8 appear?\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 140-149), and 8 appears 10 times (180-189). But wait, actually, in the tens place, for each hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n\nBut wait, actually, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, and for each digit, it appears 10 times (since units digit can be 0-9). So, for 100-199, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (140-149), and 8 appears 10 times (180-189). Similarly, this applies to 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nHowever, for 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, meaning that for the tens digit, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), but 8 appears only 9 times because the tens digit goes up to 8, but the units digit goes up to 8 as well, but wait, no, the tens digit in 400-488 can be 0-8, so for each tens digit, including 8, the units digit can be 0-9, except when the tens digit is 8, the units digit can only go up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.\n\nIn 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit is 0-8, and the units digit is 0-9 for each tens digit except when the tens digit is 8. Because when the tens digit is 8, the units digit can only go up to 8, making the last page 488. So, for tens digit 8, the units digits are 0-8, which is 9 numbers, not 10. \n\nTherefore, in the tens place for 400-488:\n\n- For tens digits 0-7: each appears 10 times (units 0-9)\n- For tens digit 8: appears 9 times (units 0-8)\n\nSo, for the digit 4 in the tens place in 400-488: it appears 10 times (440-449)\nFor the digit 8 in the tens place in 400-488: it appears 9 times (480-488)\n\nWait, but actually, in 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, for each of the hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), except for 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0-9. But in 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so for the tens digit 8, it only appears 9 times in that range.\n\nSo, let's calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place across all three-digit numbers.\n\nFor 100-199, 200-299, 300-399:\n\nEach of these hundreds has the tens digit 0-9, so for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times. Since there are 3 such hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), that's 3 * 10 = 30 times for 4, and 3 * 10 = 30 times for 8.\n\nNow, for 400-488:\n\nAs established, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, adding that to the previous total:\n\nTotal 4's in tens place: 30 + 10 = 40\nTotal 8's in tens place: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nWait, but let me make sure. For 400-488, the tens digit is 0-8, so 4 appears in the tens place as 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. 8 appears in the tens place as 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 times.\n\nSo, total for tens place: 4's = 30 (from 100-399) + 10 = 40\n8's = 30 (from 100-399) + 9 = 39\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. The units digit cycles from 0-9 for each combination of hundreds and tens digits.\n\nFor each hundred, the units digit 4 and 8 will each appear 10 times per ten, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399:\n\nEach hundred has 100 numbers, so for each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the units place (e.g., 104,114,...,194), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (108,118,...,198). Since there are 3 hundreds, that's 3 * 10 = 30 times for 4, and 3 * 10 = 30 times for 8.\n\nNow, for 400-488:\n\nThis range has 89 numbers (400-488). Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place.\n\nFor each tens group in 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-9, except for the last group where the tens digit is 8 and units go up to 8.\n\nSo, for tens digits 0-7: each has units digits 0-9, so in each of these 8 tens groups, 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once.\n\nFor tens digit 8: units digits go from 0-8, so 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488).\n\nWait, but let's calculate it properly.\n\nFrom 400-488, the units digit 4 appears in:\n\n404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 times because when the tens digit is 8, the units digit can be up to 8, so 484 is included. Wait, but 484 is in the tens group 480-488, which is the last group.\n\nWait, actually, from 400-488, the units digit 4 appears once in each tens group from 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. So, for each of the 9 tens groups (0-8), the units digit 4 appears once. So, that's 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, the units digit 8 appears in each tens group as well. For tens groups 0-7, units digit 8 appears once each, so that's 8 times. Then, in the tens group 480-488, units digit 8 appears once (488). So, total 8 + 1 = 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me count:\n\nIn 400-409: 408\n410-419: 418\n420-429: 428\n430-439: 438\n440-449: 448\n450-459: 458\n460-469: 468\n470-479: 478\n480-488: 488\n\nSo, that's 9 times for 8 in the units place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 9 times, but actually, in each tens group from 400-409 up to 470-479, units digit 8 appears once, that's 8 times, and then in 480-488, it's 488, so that's one more, making it 9 times.\n\nSo, in the units place for 400-488:\n\n4's: 9 times\n8's: 9 times\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's would be 9 times, and 8's would be 9 times as well. So, adding to the previous counts:\n\nFor units place in three-digit numbers:\n\n4's: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39\n8's: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in 400-488, the units digit 4 appears 9 times, and 8 appears 9 times as well. So, adding to the previous 30 each, we get 39 for both.\n\nWait, but let me check again. For 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each has 10 occurrences of 4 and 8 in the units place, so 3 * 10 = 30 each.\n\nIn 400-488: 9 occurrences each, so total 30 + 9 = 39 for both 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences for 4 and 8 in three-digit numbers.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 (from 400-488)\n- Tens place: 40\n- Units place: 39\nTotal 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 39\n- Units place: 39\nTotal 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. Earlier, I had 40 for 4's and 39 for 8's in the tens place. So, adding up:\n\n4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nSo, the difference is 168 - 78 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the counts.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times because pages 400-488, which is 89 pages. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place for 4's: 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 40. That's correct.\n\nIn the units place for 4's: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nHundreds place: 0, correct.\n\nTens place: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\nTotal 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\nDifference: 168 - 78 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when counting, it's easy to miss something.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place across all page numbers.\n\nLet's do that:\n\n1-digit pages: 1-9\n4's: 1 (page 4)\n8's: 1 (page 8)\n\n2-digit pages: 10-99\nTens place:\n4's: 10 (40-49)\n8's: 10 (80-89)\nUnits place:\n4's: 9 (14,24,...,94)\n8's: 9 (18,28,...,98)\nTotal in 2-digit: 4's = 10 + 9 = 19; 8's = 10 + 9 = 19\n\n3-digit pages: 100-488\nHundreds place:\n4's: 89 (400-488)\n8's: 0\nTens place:\n4's: For 100-399: 3 hundreds * 10 each = 30\nFor 400-488: 10 (440-449)\nTotal 4's in tens place: 30 + 10 = 40\n8's in tens place: For 100-399: 3 * 10 = 30\nFor 400-488: 9 (480-488)\nTotal 8's in tens place: 30 + 9 = 39\nUnits place:\n4's: For 100-399: 3 * 10 = 30\nFor 400-488: 9 (as calculated)\nTotal 4's in units place: 30 + 9 = 39\n8's in units place: For 100-399: 3 * 10 = 30\nFor 400-488: 9 (as calculated)\nTotal 8's in units place: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nAdding up all 4's:\n1 (1-digit) + 19 (2-digit) + 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 89 = 109; 109 + 40 = 149; 149 + 39 = 188\n\nWait, wait, this is conflicting with my earlier total of 168. Hmm, I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's recalculate:\n\nWait, when I broke it down earlier, I considered only the 3-digit pages, but now I'm including the 1-digit and 2-digit pages as well.\n\nWait, in the first approach, I considered single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit separately, but in the second approach, I'm breaking down each digit place across all pages. Let me try to do it correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the total counts earlier. Let me try a different approach: count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place across all pages.\n\nSo, total pages: 1-488.\n\nLet's consider each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. Units place:\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the units place?\n\nIn each block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9, so each digit appears once per block. There are 488 numbers, which is 48 full blocks of 10 (1-480) and 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n\nNumber of complete blocks: 48\nEach block contributes 1 occurrence of 4 and 1 of 8 in the units place, so 48 * 1 = 48 for each.\n\nNow, the remaining 8 numbers: 481-488. The units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo, total units place:\n4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. Tens place:\nSimilarly, each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each (for 10-19, 20-29, etc.), but actually, in 1-99, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1-9 for 10-99. Hmm, maybe a better way is to consider each hundred.\n\nFrom 1-488, the tens digit cycles as follows:\n\n- 1-99: tens digits are 0 (for 1-9), 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), ..., 9 (90-99). So, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place (except 0, which appears 9 times for 1-9). Wait, no, actually, in 1-99, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, and then 1-9 for 10-99, each appearing 10 times. So, from 1-99, 0 appears 9 times (1-9), and digits 1-9 each appear 10 times.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to consider 1-488 as:\n\n- 1-99: 99 numbers\n- 100-399: 300 numbers\n- 400-488: 89 numbers\n\nWait, but maybe a better approach is to count how many times each digit appears in the tens place from 1-488.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit 0-9 appears equally across the numbers.\n\nFor each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nFrom 1-99: tens digits are 0 (for 1-9), then 1-9 each appearing 10 times (from 10-19, ...,90-99). So, in 1-99, the tens digit 0 appears 9 times (pages 1-9), and digits 1-9 each appear 10 times.\n\nFrom 100-399: 300 numbers, which is 3 hundreds. Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place, so 3 * 10 = 30 times for each digit 0-9.\n\nFrom 400-488: 89 numbers. The tens digits go from 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). For each tens digit 0-8, how many times does it appear?\n\n- For tens digits 0-7: each appears 10 times (units 0-9)\n- For tens digit 8: appears 9 times (units 0-8)\n\nSo, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449)\nTens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488)\n\nNow, let's calculate the total occurrences of 4 and 8 in the tens place:\n\n- 1-99:\n  - 4 appears 10 times (40-49)\n  - 8 appears 10 times (80-89)\n- 100-399:\n  - 4 appears 30 times\n  - 8 appears 30 times\n- 400-488:\n  - 4 appears 10 times\n  - 8 appears 9 times\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 10 + 30 + 10 = 50\nTotal 8's in tens place: 10 + 30 + 9 = 49\n\n3. Hundreds place:\nFrom 1-488, the hundreds digit is:\n\n- 0 for 1-99\n- 1 for 100-199\n- 2 for 200-299\n- 3 for 300-399\n- 4 for 400-488\n\nSo, digit 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times (400-488)\nDigit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, so the difference is 90. But earlier, when I was calculating, I thought the difference was 90, but when I broke it down again, I got 188 - 98 = 90. So, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. Earlier, I thought units place for 4's was 49 and 8's was 49. Then tens place: 50 for 4's and 49 for 8's. Hundreds: 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's.\n\nSo, 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Let me start by considering each section separately.\n\nFirst, for single-digit page numbers (1-9). The digits here are just 1 through 9. So, how many 4's are there? Well, only one 4, which is page 4. Similarly, how many 8's? Only one 8, which is page 8. So, in the single-digit section, the count for 4 is 1 and for 8 is also 1. That means the difference here is 0.\n\nNext, let's move on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. The same goes for 8.\n\nStarting with 4's in two-digit numbers. For the tens place, any number from 40 to 49 will have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers (40, 41, ..., 49). So, that's 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place, in two-digit numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every ten numbers. So, in each set of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. Since there are 9 sets of ten in the two-digit numbers (10-99), that would be 9 occurrences of 4 in the units place.\n\nWait, but actually, from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of 10. So, in each set, the units digit 4 appears once, so 9 times total. But wait, from 10-99, the units digit 4 appears in 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers are 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19.\n\nNow, for 8's in two-digit numbers. Let's do the same. In the tens place, numbers from 80 to 89 have an 8 in the tens place, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nIn the units place, the digit 8 appears once every ten numbers, so in each set of ten (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the units digit 8 appears once. From 10-99, that's 9 sets, so 9 occurrences. So, total 8's in two-digit numbers are 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nWait, but that's the same as 4's. So, in two-digit numbers, both 4's and 8's appear 19 times each. So, the difference so far is still 0.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because each number has three digits: hundreds, tens, and units. I need to consider each place separately for both 4's and 8's.\n\nLet me start by considering the hundreds place. The hundreds digit in three-digit numbers can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, pages from 100-199 have hundreds digit 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nFirst, let's count how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, how about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in the three-digit range, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8 because the book ends at 488. Therefore, 0 occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place in three-digit numbers. For the tens digit, each hundred (like 100-199, 200-299, etc.) has ten numbers for each tens digit. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.), and similarly for 8.\n\nBut since our book goes up to 488, we need to check if the last hundred (400-488) affects the count. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, for 4's in the tens place:\n\n- In 100-199: The tens digit is 4 for 140-149, which is 10 numbers.\n- Similarly, in 200-299: 240-249, another 10.\n- In 300-399: 340-349, another 10.\n- In 400-488: The tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place across all three-digit numbers would be 4 sets of 10, so 40.\n\nWait, but let me check again. From 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Each of the first three hundreds contributes 10, and the last hundred also contributes 10 because 440-449 is within 400-488. So, 4 times 10 is 40.\n\nNow, for 8's in the tens place:\n\n- In 100-199: 180-189, 10 numbers.\n- In 200-299: 280-289, 10 numbers.\n- In 300-399: 380-389, 10 numbers.\n- In 400-488: 480-489, but wait, our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 instead of 10.\n\nTherefore, total 8's in the tens place would be 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, that's 39. So, 4's in tens place: 40, 8's: 39. So, difference here is 1 more 4.\n\nNow, let's check the units place in three-digit numbers.\n\nFor 4's in the units place:\n\nIn each hundred, for each ten, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each hundred, the units digit 4 appears once every ten numbers. Since each hundred has 100 numbers, that's 10 occurrences per hundred for the units digit 4.\n\nSo, for 100-199: 10 times (104, 114, ..., 194)\n200-299: 10 times\n300-399: 10 times\n400-488: Now, here, the units digit 4 appears in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, but 484 is within 488, so that's 9 numbers. Wait, no, wait: from 400-488, how many numbers have units digit 4?\n\nWell, starting at 404, then 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 404 + 10*8 = 484, which is the ninth occurrence. So, 9 times.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 89 divided by 10 is 8 full decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then 9 more numbers. Wait, no, actually, 400-488 includes 400-409, 410-419, etc., up to 480-488. So, how many times does the units digit 4 appear?\n\nFrom 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs at 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times. So, total units digit 4's in three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nWait, that's 39. So, 4's in units place: 39.\n\nNow, for 8's in the units place:\n\nSimilarly, in each hundred, the units digit 8 appears once every ten numbers. So, 100-199: 108, 118, ..., 198: 10 times.\n200-299: 208, 218, ..., 298: 10 times.\n300-399: 308, 318, ..., 398: 10 times.\n400-488: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 times because 408 is the first, then adding 10 each time until 488. So, 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488: 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total 8's in units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, so both 4's and 8's in the units place of three-digit numbers are 39 each. So, no difference there.\n\nWait, but earlier, for 4's in the tens place, we had 40, and for 8's in the tens place, 39, so that's a difference of +1 for 4's.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's and 8's across all sections.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: hundreds place: 89, tens place: 40, units place: 39. So, total in three-digit: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, no, wait: 89 is the hundreds place, 40 is the tens place, and 39 is the units place. So, total 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nSimilarly, 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: hundreds place: 0, tens place: 39, units place: 39. So, total in three-digit: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, in three-digit numbers, 4's: hundreds place 89, tens place 40, units place 39. So, 89 + 40 = 129, plus 39 is 168.\n\n8's: hundreds place 0, tens place 39, units place 39. So, 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nSo, total 4's: single-digit 1 + two-digit 19 + three-digit 168 = 1 + 19 = 20, plus 168 is 188.\n\nTotal 8's: single-digit 1 + two-digit 19 + three-digit 78 = 1 + 19 = 20, plus 78 is 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 would be 90, which seems high. Let me check my calculations again because I think I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the three-digit 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with 4's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\n- Tens place: In each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each except the last one. Wait, no, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times in each hundred, so 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40.\n\n- Units place: In each hundred, the units digit 4 appears 10 times. But in 400-488, the units digit 4 appears 9 times because 488 is the last page. So, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, total units digit 4's: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, 4's in three-digit: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in three-digit:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, as before.\n\n- Tens place: In each hundred, 10 times, except the last hundred. Wait, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 480-489 would be 10, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\n- Units place: In each hundred, 10 times, except in 400-488, where it's 9 times. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, 8's in three-digit: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nNow, adding the single-digit and two-digit counts:\n\nTotal 4's: single-digit 1 + two-digit 19 + three-digit 168 = 1 + 19 = 20 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: single-digit 1 + two-digit 19 + three-digit 78 = 1 + 19 = 20 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again because I might have overcounted somewhere.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, for 4's in the hundreds place, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 40 times, as each hundred contributes 10, and there are 4 hundreds. So, 40.\n\nIn the units place, 39 times because the last hundred only contributes 9. So, 39.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's, in the tens place, 39 times because the last hundred only contributes 9 instead of 10.\n\nIn the units place, same thing: 39 times.\n\nSo, 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nAdding single and two-digit counts:\n\n4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me double-check because sometimes when counting digits, especially in different places, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nTotal pages: 488.\n\nIn the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears equally often except possibly the last set if the total isn't a multiple of 10.\n\nSo, for units digit:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full groups (since 48*10=480), with 8 remaining pages (481-488).\n\nIn each complete group of 10, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place.\n\nSo, for units digit 4: 48 times (each group contributes one 4) plus in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total units digit 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8: 48 times plus in the last 8 pages, 488 has units digit 8, so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that's different from what I calculated earlier. Earlier, I had 39 4's in units place for three-digit numbers, but this approach suggests 49. There's a discrepancy here. Let me see where I went wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps my earlier approach was incorrect. Let me think again.\n\nActually, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the units place?\n\nFor digits 1-9, in the units place, each digit appears floor(488/10) = 48 times, plus an additional 1 if the digit is less than or equal to the remainder when 488 is divided by 10, which is 8.\n\nSo, for digits 1-8, they appear 48 + 1 = 49 times each in the units place.\n\nFor digit 9, it appears 48 times because 488 mod 10 is 8, which is less than 9, so no extra.\n\nWait, but 488 is page 488, so the units digits go up to 8. So, for units digit 4, it appears 48 times in the first 480 pages, plus once in 484, totaling 49.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8 appears 48 times in the first 480 pages, plus once in 488, so 49.\n\nWait, so according to this, units digit 4 and 8 each appear 49 times. But earlier, when I broke it down by sections, I had 39 for 4's and 39 for 8's in the units place. That's a discrepancy. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake in the earlier breakdown by sections. Because when I considered three-digit numbers, I was only looking at 100-488, but the units digit 4 and 8 also appear in single-digit and two-digit numbers.\n\nWait, no, in single-digit numbers, units digit is the same as the number itself. So, in single-digit, units digit 4 appears once, and units digit 8 appears once.\n\nIn two-digit numbers, from 10-99, each units digit from 0-9 appears 9 times (since there are 9 sets of ten: 10-19, ..., 90-99). So, units digit 4 appears 9 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nIn three-digit numbers, from 100-488, the units digit 4 appears 48 times (from 100-488, each hundred contributes 10 units digit 4's, except the last hundred which contributes 9). Wait, but earlier I calculated 39, but now with this method, it's 49 - (1 single-digit + 9 two-digit) = 49 - 10 = 39. Wait, no, that's not the right way.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to calculate units digits across all pages.\n\nTotal units digit 4's: 49 (from 1-488).\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8's: 49.\n\nSimilarly, for tens digit:\n\nEach digit in the tens place appears 10 times per hundred. So, from 1-488, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place?\n\nFor tens digit 4:\n\n- In 40-49: 10 times (but only 40-49 is in the first hundred)\n- In 140-149: 10 times\n- In 240-249: 10 times\n- In 340-349: 10 times\n- In 440-449: 10 times (since 440-449 is within 400-488)\n- Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 times.\n\nWait, but from 1-488, the tens digit 4 appears in:\n\n- 40-49: 10\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249:10\n- 340-349:10\n- 440-449:10\n\nThat's 5 sets of 10, so 50 times.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid.\n\nSimilarly, for tens digit 8:\n\n- 80-89:10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers)\n\nSo, tens digit 8 appears 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, so tens digit 4 appears 50 times, and tens digit 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, for hundreds digit:\n\nFrom 1-99, there's no hundreds digit.\n\nFrom 100-488, the hundreds digit is 1,2,3,4.\n\nSo, hundreds digit 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n\nHundreds digit 8 never appears because the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, hundreds digit 4:89 times, hundreds digit 8:0 times.\n\nNow, summing up all occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more because I want to be absolutely sure.\n\nYes, using the digit-by-digit approach, each digit's count is calculated as follows:\n\nUnits digit:\n\n- 4:49 times\n- 8:49 times\n\nTens digit:\n\n- 4:50 times\n- 8:49 times\n\nHundreds digit:\n\n- 4:89 times\n- 8:0 times\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the single-digit pages, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears exactly once, on page 4. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once on page 8. So, in the single-digit pages, 4 and 8 each appear once, so the count for both is the same here.\n\nNext, I need to look at the two-digit pages, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I should calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each of these places.\n\nStarting with the tens place for two-digit numbers: the tens digit cycles from 1 to 9, each covering 10 numbers. So, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, from 40 to 49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 pages. So that's 10 times. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place, from 80 to 89, the tens digit is 8 for 10 pages. So, that's another 10 times.\n\nNow, looking at the units place for two-digit numbers: for each set of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set, the digit 4 appears once (like 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8 (like 18, 28, etc.). Since there are 9 sets of ten in the two-digit numbers (10-99), each digit from 0-9 appears 9 times in the units place. Wait, no, actually, from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of ten. So, for each digit in the units place, it appears 9 times. Therefore, 4 appears 9 times in the units place, and 8 also appears 9 times in the units place.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. Similarly, the total number of 8's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. So, in two-digit pages, 4 and 8 each appear 19 times, so again, they're equal here.\n\nNow, moving on to the three-digit pages, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because each page number has three digits: hundreds, tens, and units. I need to calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each of these places.\n\nLet me start with the hundreds place. The hundreds digit in three-digit numbers can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, let's see:\n\n- For hundreds digit 1: pages 100-199. The hundreds digit is 1, so it doesn't contribute to 4's or 8's.\n- For hundreds digit 2: pages 200-299. Similarly, hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's or 8's here.\n- For hundreds digit 3: pages 300-399. Hundreds digit is 3, so again, no 4's or 8's here.\n- For hundreds digit 4: pages 400-488. Here, the hundreds digit is 4, so each page from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, how many pages are there from 400 to 488? Let me calculate that. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, contributing 89 occurrences of the digit 4.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all because the highest hundreds digit is 4.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be from 0 to 9, and each digit appears in cycles. Let me break it down by the hundreds group.\n\nFirst, for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: each of these groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) will have the tens digit cycling from 0 to 9 for each ten pages. So, for each of these hundreds groups, the digit 4 in the tens place appears 10 times (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), and similarly, the digit 8 in the tens place appears 10 times (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).\n\nSo, for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, each contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place and 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. Since there are 3 such hundreds groups, that's 3 * 10 = 30 for both 4's and 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the hundreds digit 4 (pages 400-488), the tens digit can go from 0 to 8 because 488 is the last page. Wait, actually, let me check: 400-488. So, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, because 488 is the last page, so the tens digits in 400-488 go from 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), ..., up to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here?\n\nLooking at the tens digit in 400-488, 4 appears in the tens place when the tens digit is 4, which is pages 440-449. That's 10 pages, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears in the tens place when the tens digit is 8, which is pages 480-488. But wait, 488 is the last page, so how many pages are there from 480-488? Let's calculate: 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 pages. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n\nSo, in the hundreds digit 4 group, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nAdding this to the earlier counts for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, the total number of 4's in the tens place across all three-digit numbers is 30 (from 1,2,3) + 10 (from 4) = 40. Similarly, 8's in the tens place are 30 (from 1,2,3) + 9 (from 4) = 39.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. So, for hundreds digits 1,2,3, each contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so that's 3*10=30 for each. Then, in the hundreds digit 4 group, 4's tens place is 10 (440-449), and 8's tens place is 9 (480-488). So, total 4's in tens place: 30 + 10 = 40, and 8's: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, I'll consider each hundreds group separately.\n\nFor hundreds digits 1,2,3:\n\nIn each of these groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each ten pages. So, in each group, the digit 4 appears once in the units place for each ten, so 10 times per group. Similarly, 8 appears once in the units place for each ten, so 10 times per group.\n\nSince there are 3 such hundreds groups, the total for 4's in the units place is 3 * 10 = 30, and same for 8's: 3 * 10 = 30.\n\nNow, for the hundreds digit 4 group (400-488):\n\nThe units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each ten pages, except possibly the last one if the total number isn't a multiple of 10. Let's check: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 pages mean that the units digits go through 8 full cycles of 10 (400-479) and then 9 more pages (480-488). Wait, no, actually, 400-488 is 89 pages, so 8 full decades (400-479) is 80 pages, and then 480-488 is 9 pages.\n\nWait, actually, 400-488 is 89 pages. So, from 400 to 479, that's 80 pages (since 479 - 400 + 1 = 80). Then from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages. So, in the units place for 400-479, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 8 times (since 80 pages / 10 digits = 8 times each). So, the digit 4 appears 8 times in the units place, and 8 appears 8 times as well.\n\nThen, in the last 9 pages (480-488), the units digits go from 0 to 8. So, in these 9 pages, the digit 4 appears once (484), and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, in the units place for the hundreds digit 4 group, 4 appears 8 + 1 = 9 times, and 8 appears 8 + 1 = 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. From 400-479, units digits 0-9 each appear 8 times, correct. Then from 480-488, units digits 0-8 appear once each, so 4 and 8 each appear once more. So, total for units place in 400-488: 8 (from 400-479) +1 (from 480-488) = 9 times for 4, and same for 8.\n\nSo, in the hundreds digit 4 group, 4's in units place: 9, and 8's in units place:9.\n\nAdding this to the earlier counts from hundreds digits 1,2,3: 30 (for 4's) +9=39 for 4's, and 30 (for 8's) +9=39 for 8's.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because in the hundreds digits 1,2,3, we had 30 for both 4's and 8's in the units place. Then, in the hundreds digit 4 group, we have 9 for both. So, total for units place:\n\n4's: 30 +9=39\n\n8's:30 +9=39\n\nSo, in the units place, both 4's and 8's appear 39 times.\n\nWait, but let me check again. For hundreds digits 1,2,3: each contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the units place, so 3*10=30 for each. Then, in hundreds digit 4 group, units place: 8 from 400-479 and 1 from 480-488, so 9 total for each. So, 30+9=39 for both 4's and 8's in the units place.\n\nSo, now, let's sum up all the occurrences of 4's and 8's in the three-digit numbers.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 40\n- Units place: 39\nTotal 4's: 89 +40 +39 = 168\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 39\n- Units place: 39\nTotal 8's: 0 +39 +39=78\n\nWait, that seems off because in the tens place, I had 39 for 8's, and units place 39, so 78 total. But let me check the tens place again.\n\nEarlier, for the hundreds digits 1,2,3, the tens place for 8's was 10 per group, so 3*10=30. Then, in the hundreds digit 4 group, the tens place for 8's was 9 (from 480-488). So, total 30 +9=39 for 8's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for units place, 30 +9=39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: 39 (tens) +39 (units) =78.\n\nWait, but what about the hundreds place? Since the hundreds digit only goes up to 4, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all, so 0.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: 78.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's: hundreds place 89, tens place 40, units place 39. So, 89+40=129, plus 39 is 168.\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit pages.\n\nFirst, single-digit:\n\n- 4's:1\n- 8's:1\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- 4's:19\n- 8's:19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- 4's:168\n- 8's:78\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 +19 +168=188\n\nTotal 8's:1 +19 +78=98\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems a bit high. Let me go through each part again.\n\nStarting with single-digit:\n\n- 4:1, 8:1. Correct.\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place: 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n- Units place: 4 appears 9 times (14,24,...94), same for 8:9 times.\n- So, total 4's:10+9=19, 8's:10+9=19. Correct.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears from 400-488: 89 times.\n- 8 appears:0 times.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: each contributes 10 times for 4's and 10 times for 8's in the tens place. So, 3*10=30 for each.\n- Hundreds digit 4: 4's in tens place: 10 times (440-449), 8's in tens place:9 times (480-488).\n- So, total 4's in tens place:30+10=40, 8's:30+9=39.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: each contributes 10 times for 4's and 10 times for 8's. So, 3*10=30 for each.\n- Hundreds digit 4: 4's in units place: from 400-479:8 times, and 484:1 time, total 9. Similarly, 8's in units place: from 400-479:8 times, and 488:1 time, total 9.\n- So, total 4's in units place:30+9=39, same for 8's:30+9=39.\n\nSo, three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's:89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units)=168\n- 8's:0 (hundreds) +39 (tens) +39 (units)=78\n\nAdding up all ranges:\n\n4's:1 (single) +19 (two-digit) +168 (three-digit)=188\n\n8's:1 (single) +19 (two-digit) +78 (three-digit)=98\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nHmm, so according to this, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. But let me think again. When I calculated the units place for the hundreds digit 4 group, I considered 480-488 as 9 pages, which is correct because 488-480+1=9. So, in units place, 480-488: units digits 0-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, that part is correct.\n\nWait, but in the units place for the hundreds digit 4 group, from 400-479, which is 80 pages, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 8 times, so 4 appears 8 times, and 8 appears 8 times. Then, from 480-488, which is 9 pages, units digits 0-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total 8+1=9 for both. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for hundreds digit 4 group, 440-449 is 10 pages, so 4 appears 10 times, and 480-488 is 9 pages, so 8 appears 9 times. So, that adds up correctly.\n\nSo, the total for 4's in three-digit numbers is 89+40+39=168, and for 8's, it's 39+39=78. Then, adding single and two-digit counts, we get 188 and 98, respectively.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Single-Digit Pages (1-9):**\n   - Digit 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - Digit 8 appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-Digit Pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - 4 appears 10 times (40-49).\n     - 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Each digit (0-9) appears 9 times in the units place for two-digit numbers.\n     - 4 and 8 each appear 9 times.\n   - **Total for Two-Digit Pages:**\n     - 4: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n     - 8: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\n3. **Three-Digit Pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - 4 appears 89 times (pages 400-488).\n     - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8.\n     - Hundreds digit 4: 4 appears 10 times (440-449), 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n     - **Total:**\n       - 4: 30 (from 1,2,3) + 10 = 40.\n       - 8: 30 (from 1,2,3) + 9 = 39.\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8.\n     - Hundreds digit 4: 4 appears 9 times (8 from 400-479, 1 from 484).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (8 from 400-479, 1 from 488).\n     - **Total:**\n       - 4: 30 + 9 = 39.\n       - 8: 30 + 9 = 39.\n   - **Total for Three-Digit Pages:**\n     - 4: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n     - 8: 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\n4. **Total Counts Across All Pages:**\n   - **4's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n   - **8's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - More 4's than 8's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI think the best way to approach this is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. \n\nFirst, the units place: For every set of ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many such sets are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 complete sets of ten and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). In each of the 48 complete sets, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once more in the units place. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? \n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The three-digit numbers start from 100, so the first block is 100-199, then 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. \n\nIn each hundred block, the tens place digit 4 appears in the 40-49 range. So, in the 100-199 block, that's 10 times (140-149). Similarly, in 200-299, it's another 10 times (240-249), and in 300-399, another 10 times (340-349). Now, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449. So that's another 10 times. Wait, but 488 is less than 499, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, 10 times.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is only up to 488, so 440-449 is fully included. So, that's 10 times. So, adding up, each hundred block contributes 10 times, and there are four hundred blocks (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 isn't a full hundred, but in terms of the tens digit, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 times. So, total 4's in the tens place would be 10 (from 100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 times.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because in the 400-488 block, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 times, correct. But in the 100-199 block, the tens digit is 4 in 140-149, which is 10 times, same for 240-249 and 340-349. So, yes, 4 blocks each contributing 10 times, so 40 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89, plus 89 is 178? Wait, 49 + 40 is 89, plus 89 is 178? Wait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, 49 (units) + 40 (tens) = 89, plus 89 (hundreds) would be 178. Hmm, but let me think again because maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each having a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 40 + 89 = 178.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's.\n\nStarting with units place: Similar to 4's, each set of ten numbers has one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of ten (1-10, 11-20, etc.) and then 8 extra pages (481-488). Each complete set contributes one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 pages, 488 is the last page, so the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such block contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488?\n\nAgain, considering the hundreds blocks:\n\n100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 times.\n\n200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 times.\n\n300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 times.\n\n400-488: The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, adding up: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488, so that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, 9 times, correct.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: 39.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, the hundreds place has zero 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (39) + hundreds (0) = 88.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 178 (4's) - 88 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 complete tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 484 has a 4, so that's one more. So, 49 total.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributes 10 each, so 30. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 30 + 10 = 40.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 40 + 89 = 178. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 complete tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in 481-488, the units digit 8 appears once at 488, so total 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributes 10 each, so 30. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. Total 30 + 9 = 39.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 39 + 0 = 88.\n\nSo, 178 - 88 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about the hundreds place for 4's, I considered 400-488 as 89 numbers, which is correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nBut let me check if I missed any other 4's in the hundreds place. No, because only numbers from 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, and that's 89 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, in the 400-488 range, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, 10 in each of the first three hundreds, and 9 in the last, totaling 39.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of ten consecutive numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of ten in 488 pages (480 pages), contributing 48 fours.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) include one more 4 (at 484).\n   - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers in each hundred block (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - There are four such blocks contributing 10 each: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488 (only up to 449, but still 10 numbers).\n   - Total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 178.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, each set of ten has one 8, contributing 48.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) include one more 8 (at 488).\n   - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers in each hundred block (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n   - There are three full blocks (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10.\n   - In the 400-488 block, 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - There are no page numbers in the 800s, so no 8's here.\n   - Total in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 39 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 88.\n\n**Difference:**\n178 (number of 4's) - 88 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

After that, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. \n\nFirst, let's look at the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, for example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. \n\nTo calculate this, I can divide 488 by 10 to see how many complete groups of 10 there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 48 times 10 is 480, so the last group goes up to 480, and then we have 481 to 488. So, in the units place, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear there. Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. In the tens place, 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, each of those 10 numbers has a 4 in the tens place. Similarly, from 140-149, 240-249, etc. \n\nSo, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see: 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, which means there are 4 complete hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 times 10 is 40. But wait, in the last partial hundred, from 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, that adds another 10, making it 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Because from 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, so 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 (from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349) plus 10 (from 440-449), totaling 50. Wait, but 40-49 is in the first hundred, 140-149 in the second, 240-249 in the third, and 340-349 in the fourth, and then 440-449 in the fifth, but wait, 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds go up to 400-488. So, actually, the hundreds are 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears once for each hundred except the last one, which only goes up to 488. \n\nWait, maybe a better way is to calculate how many times 4 appears in the tens place. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9. So, for each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. Now, how many complete hundreds are there? From 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So that's 5 sets, but the last set is only up to 488, which is 88 numbers. \n\nWait, no, actually, the first four hundreds are complete: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and then 400-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, 4 times 10 is 40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10, making it 50 in total for the tens place.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, from 400 to 488 inclusive. So, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers, so 10 more 4's in the tens place. So, total 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but wait, the hundreds digit is 4 only when the number is between 400 and 499, but since our book ends at 488, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds. That would be 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times, correct. So, 48.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place. There are 4 complete hundreds before 400, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, totaling 50. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me think again. Maybe I'm overcounting? No, each digit is in a different position, so it's okay to add them up.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set, from 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8 in the units place. So, actually, it's 48 full groups (1-480) plus one more in 488, making it 49 times. Wait, no, because 480 is the last number in the 48th group, so 480 is included, and then 481-488 is the next group. So, in 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 (from 1-480) + 1 (from 488) = 49.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so it's included. So, 488 is page 488, so units digit 8 appears once more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, tens place: Similar to 4's, in the tens place, 8 appears in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, etc. Each of these blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nHow many such blocks are there? From 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, in each complete hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times. So, for the first four hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), that's 4 times 10 = 40.\n\nNow, in the last partial hundred, 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, 480-488 is part of this. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, but wait, 480 has a tens digit of 8? Wait, no. 480 is 4 8 0, so tens digit is 8. So, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. In the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 more 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I thought 4's were 187 and 8's were 98, so the difference would be 89. But let me check again.\n\nWait, units place for 8: I thought 48 full groups (1-480) each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then 488 adds another, making it 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place for 8: Each complete hundred (1-99, 100-199, etc.) contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more, totaling 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me take a smaller example to check.\n\nFor example, in 1-99, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, in 100-199, it's 180-189, another 10. Same for 200-299: 280-289, 10. And 300-399: 380-389, 10. So, that's 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 187, which would make the difference 187 - 98 = 89. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the hundreds place for 4's is 89, which is a significant number.\n\nWait, let me recast the problem. Maybe I should think in terms of each digit position separately.\n\nFor units digit:\n\n- 4's: floor(488/10) = 48, plus if the last digit is >=4, we add 1 if the remainder is >=4. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with remainder 8, which is >=4, so 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, no, that's for 8's. Wait, no, for 4's, the units digit is 4 every 10 numbers. So, from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's floor(488/10) = 48, and since the remainder is 8, which is >=4, we add 1 more. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, maybe I was wrong earlier.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is given by:\n\nnumber = (n // 10) * 1 + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nWait, no, that's not exactly right. Wait, for each complete group of 10, the digit d appears once in the units place. Then, in the incomplete group, if the last digit is >= d, we add 1.\n\nSo, for 4's in units place:\n\nn = 488\n\nnumber = (488 // 10) + (1 if (488 % 10) >= 4 else 0)\n\nWhich is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let's take a smaller example. From 1-14, how many 4's in the units place? 4 and 14, so two times. Using the formula: 14//10=1, and 14%10=4 >=4, so 1 +1=2. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, from 1-13: 13//10=1, 13%10=3 <4, so 1 +0=1. Correct, only 4.\n\nSo, applying that, for 4's in units place, it's 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, so earlier I was wrong. It should be 49, not 48.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place:\n\nn=488\n\nnumber = 488//10=48, and 488%10=8 >=8, so 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 8's in units place were 49, which matches this.\n\nSo, I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought 4's in units place were 48. It's actually 49.\n\nSo, let's correct that.\n\nSo, units place for 4's: 49.\n\nTens place for 4's: Let's use a similar approach.\n\nIn the tens place, the digit 4 appears in blocks of 100. Each block contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, how many complete blocks are there?\n\nFrom 1-99: 40-49 is one block, contributing 10.\n\n100-199: 140-149, another 10.\n\n200-299: 240-249, another 10.\n\n300-399: 340-349, another 10.\n\n400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so another 10.\n\nSo, total blocks: 5, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is only up to 488, but 440-449 is within that range, so yes, 10 numbers.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 50, so that's correct.\n\nNow, hundreds place for 4's: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nWait, earlier I thought 4's were 187, but now it's 188. So, I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's recalculate:\n\nUnits place: 49\n\nTens place: 50\n\nHundreds place: 89\n\nTotal: 49+50=99; 99+89=188.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49\n\nTens place: 49\n\nHundreds place: 0\n\nTotal: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188\n\nTotal 8's: 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so the difference is 90.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought 4's were 187, the difference was 89, but now with 4's at 188, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, let me check again.\n\nWait, for 4's in units place: 488//10=48, remainder 8, which is >=4, so 48+1=49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10, and there are 5 hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). So, 5*10=50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 488//10=48, remainder 8, which is >=8, so 48+1=49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10, and there are 5 hundreds. But wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't overcount in the tens place for 8's. Let me think about it again.\n\nIn the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 occurrences, not 10. So, in the tens place, 8's: 4*10 +9=49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10, contributing 48 times. Since the last page (488) ends with an 8, which is \u22654, add 1 more. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks of 10 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 5 such blocks (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), each contributing 10 times. Total: 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in pages 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups, plus 1 more in 488. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks of 10 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 full blocks contributing 40, plus 9 more in 480-488. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place. Total: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - 4's: 188\n   - 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.  \nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, then find the difference between the two counts. Let's start by counting the number of 4's.\n\nFirst, let's handle the single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears exactly once, which is on page 4. So, count_4_single = 1.\n\nNext, for the two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each two-digit number has a tens place and a units place. I can count the number of 4's in the tens place and the number of 4's in the units place separately.\n\nFor the tens place: The numbers from 40 to 49 all have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so count_4_tens = 10.\n\nFor the units place: The digit 4 appears once every ten numbers, so in 10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99. There are 9 decades (10-19 up to 90-99), and in each, 4 appears once in the units place. So, count_4_units = 9.\n\nWait, but wait a second, from 10-99, that's 90 numbers. For the units place, in each ten (like 10-19), the units digit cycles from 0-9, so 4 appears once per ten. There are 9 tens (10-19 up to 90-99), so 9 times 1 equals 9. So, count_4_units = 9.\n\nSo, total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Let's break this down further. Each three-digit number has hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 4's in each place:\n\n1. Hundreds place:\n   - For 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, count_4_hundreds = 89.\n\n2. Tens place:\n   - For each hundred range (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every ten numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.).\n   - How many hundreds are there? Well, for 100-399, that's three hundreds, and for 400-488, it's part of the fourth hundred. But since we're only going up to 488, we need to check if the tens digit 4 appears fully in each hundred.\n\n   Let's break it down:\n   - For 100-199: The tens digit 4 occurs in 140-149, which is 10 numbers. So, count_4_tens_100s = 10.\n   - Similarly, for 200-299: 240-249, count_4_tens_200s = 10.\n   - For 300-399: 340-349, count_4_tens_300s = 10.\n   - For 400-488: The tens digit 4 would be in 440-449. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is entirely within 400-488. So, count_4_tens_400s = 10.\n\n   So, total count_4_tens = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40.\n\n3. Units place:\n   - Similarly, the units digit cycles every ten numbers. So, in each hundred, the units digit 4 appears once every ten numbers.\n   - Let's calculate for each hundred:\n     - 100-199: The units digit 4 appears in 104, 114, 124, ..., 194. That's 10 times. So, count_4_units_100s = 10.\n     - 200-299: Similarly, 204, 214, ..., 294. 10 times. count_4_units_200s = 10.\n     - 300-399: 304, 314, ..., 394. 10 times. count_4_units_300s = 10.\n     - 400-488: Now, from 400-488, the units digit 4 appears in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, let's count them. From 400 to 488, how many numbers have units digit 4? Let's see: starting at 404, then every 10 numbers up to 484. So, 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. Wait, is 484 included? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, count_4_units_400s = 9.\n\n   So, total count_4_units = 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's in three-digit numbers:\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 40\n- Units place: 39\nTotal_4_three_digit = 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's:\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal_4 = 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9). The digit 8 appears once, on page 8. So, count_8_single = 1.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers (10-99):\n- Tens place: The numbers from 80-89 have 8 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers. So, count_8_tens = 10.\n- Units place: In each ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), the units digit 8 appears once. There are 9 tens, so count_8_units = 9.\n\nSo, total_8_two_digit = 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nThree-digit page numbers (100-488):\nAgain, let's break it down by hundreds, tens, and units.\n\n1. Hundreds place:\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no three-digit numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, count_8_hundreds = 0.\n\n2. Tens place:\n   - For each hundred range (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 10 numbers per hundred.\n   - Let's check each hundred:\n     - 100-199: 180-189, which is 10 numbers. count_8_tens_100s = 10.\n     - 200-299: 280-289, count_8_tens_200s = 10.\n     - 300-399: 380-389, count_8_tens_300s = 10.\n     - 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, count_8_tens_400s = 9.\n\n   So, total count_8_tens = 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\n3. Units place:\n   - For each hundred, the units digit 8 appears once every ten numbers.\n   - Let's calculate for each hundred:\n     - 100-199: 108, 118, 128, ..., 198. That's 10 numbers. count_8_units_100s = 10.\n     - 200-299: 208, 218, ..., 298. 10 numbers. count_8_units_200s = 10.\n     - 300-399: 308, 318, ..., 398. 10 numbers. count_8_units_300s = 10.\n     - 400-488: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. Let's count these. Starting at 408, each 10 numbers: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included. So, count_8_units_400s = 9.\n\n   So, total count_8_units = 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's in three-digit numbers:\n- Tens place: 39\n- Units place: 39\nTotal_8_three_digit = 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nWait, but wait a second, the hundreds place was 0, so total_8_three_digit = 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nNow, summing up all the 8's:\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal_8 = 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) = 20, plus 78 (three-digit) = 98. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, we subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's.\n\nTotal_4 = 188\nTotal_8 = 98\nDifference = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me go through the calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n- Three-digit:\n  - Hundreds: 89\n  - Tens: 40\n  - Units: 39\n  Total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\nTotal_4 = 1 + 19 + 168 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n- Three-digit:\n  - Tens: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n  - Units: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n  Total: 39 + 39 = 78\nTotal_8 = 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting the units place for 4's in three-digit numbers, I got 39. Let me verify that.\n\nIn 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has 10 numbers where the units digit is 4. So, 3 * 10 = 30. Then, in 400-488, units digit 4 appears 9 times (404, 414, ..., 484). So, 30 + 9 = 39. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in three-digit numbers, units digit 8 appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds, and 9 times in 400-488, totaling 39. Same for tens place.\n\nWait, but in the three-digit numbers, for the tens place of 8's, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 would be from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, that's 9, correct.\n\nSo, yeah, the counts seem accurate. Therefore, the difference is 90.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference between their counts.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 40-49 \u2192 10 times.\n     - Units place: 4 appears once in each ten (14, 24, ..., 94) \u2192 9 times.\n     - Total in two-digit: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n     - Tens place: 4 appears in 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 10 each, totaling 40.\n     - Units place: 4 appears once in each ten across all hundreds except the last, which has 9 \u2192 39.\n     - Total in three-digit: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n   - **Total 4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** 8 appears once (page 8).\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 80-89 \u2192 10 times.\n     - Units place: 8 appears once in each ten (18, 28, ..., 98) \u2192 9 times.\n     - Total in two-digit: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: 0 times (since pages go up to 488).\n     - Tens place: 8 appears in 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 10, 10, 10, 9 \u2192 39.\n     - Units place: 8 appears once in each ten across all hundreds except the last, which has 9 \u2192 39.\n     - Total in three-digit: 39 + 39 = 78.\n   - **Total 8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - More 4's than 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense.\n\nLet me start by considering the one-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears exactly once, on page 4. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once, on page 8. So, in the one-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear once each. That means the count for 4 is 1 and for 8 is also 1 here. \n\nMoving on to two-digit numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each digit can be in the tens place or the units place. I think I should count the number of times 4 appears in the tens place and then in the units place separately, and do the same for 8.\n\nStarting with the tens place: For two-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 1 through 9. So, for the tens digit being 4, the numbers would be from 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, for the tens digit being 8, the numbers would be from 80 to 89, which is another 10 numbers, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers: The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each tens group. So, for each group (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. Since there are 9 groups (10-99), that's 9 times for 4 in the units place. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once in each group's units place, so 9 times for 8.\n\nWait, but hold on, from 10 to 99, there are actually 9 decades (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), so each digit from 0-9 appears 9 times in the units place. But wait, actually, for each decade, the units digits go from 0 to 9, so for each digit, it appears once per decade. Since there are 9 decades, each digit appears 9 times in the units place. So, for 4 and 8, that's 9 each in the units place for two-digit numbers.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. So, in two-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each.\n\nWait, but wait a second, when I'm counting the units digits, from 10 to 99, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 9 times in the units place, right? Because for each of the 9 decades (10-19, etc.), each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, 9 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place. So, that part is correct.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, 4 appears 19 times, and 8 appears 19 times.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Here, each number has three digits: hundreds, tens, and units. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each of these places.\n\nLet's break it down by each digit place.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, since the book goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit ranges from 1 to 4.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4: The numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 is 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). But wait, actually, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\n- For hundreds digit 8: Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can't be 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, the hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800 to 899, which isn't part of this book. So, in this case, the hundreds digit 8 doesn't appear at all in the three-digit numbers of this book. So, 0 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be from 0 to 9, but we need to consider how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place, the same applies.\n\nLet me handle the tens place first.\n\nFor the tens digit being 4: We need to count how many numbers between 100 and 488 have 4 in the tens place. The tens digit is 4, so the numbers would be from X40 to X49, where X is the hundreds digit. But since our hundreds digits go up to 4, let's consider each hundreds group.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n- Hundreds digit 2: 240-249. Another 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n- Hundreds digit 3: 340-349. Another 10 times.\n- Hundreds digit 4: 440-449. But wait, our book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488. So, that's another 10 numbers.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's 10 times. So, total for the tens digit being 4 is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 times.\n\nWait, but wait, when hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can go up to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, does that affect the count for the tens digit 4? No, because 440-449 is within 488, so it's still 10 numbers. So, 40 times in total for 4 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens digit being 8: Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 180-189. 10 numbers.\n- Hundreds digit 2: 280-289. 10 numbers.\n- Hundreds digit 3: 380-389. 10 numbers.\n- Hundreds digit 4: 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last one). So, that's 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total for tens digit 8 is 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. For hundreds digit 1, 2, 3, the tens digit 8 gives 10 numbers each, so 3*10=30. For hundreds digit 4, the tens digit 8 would be from 480 to 489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, 30 + 9 = 39 times. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Here, we need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units digit across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nStarting with 4 in the units place:\n\nFor each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), we can count how many times 4 appears in the units place.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: The units digit cycles from 0-9 for each tens group. So, in 100-199, for each ten (like 100-109, 110-119, etc.), the units digit 4 appears once. There are 10 tens groups (00-09, 10-19, ..., 90-99), so 10 times for each hundreds group. So, 10 times in 100-199.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2: Similarly, 200-299, 10 times.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3: 300-399, 10 times.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Now, here, the units digit 4 appears once in each tens group. The tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, from 400-488, how many tens groups are there? From 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so the units digit 4 appears once in each of the tens groups up to 480-489, but since we stop at 488, does that affect the count?\n\nWait, actually, for each tens group, regardless of how many numbers are in the group, the units digit cycles from 0-9. So, in 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but for each tens digit, the units digit 4 appears once. So, for tens digits 0-8, that's 9 tens groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 400-488, the tens digit can be 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), ..., up to 8 (480-488). So, that's 9 tens groups. In each of these, the units digit 4 appears once, so 9 times. Therefore, in the hundreds digit 4 group, 4 appears 9 times in the units place.\n\nSo, total for 4 in the units place across all three-digit numbers is:\n\n10 (hundreds=1) + 10 (hundreds=2) + 10 (hundreds=3) + 9 (hundreds=4) = 39 times.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check that. For hundreds=1, 100-199, each tens group (like 100-109, 110-119, etc.) has 10 numbers, and in each, the units digit 4 appears once, so 10 times. Similarly for hundreds=2 and 3. For hundreds=4, from 400-488, the tens digits go up to 8, so 9 tens groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 9 times. So, total 10+10+10+9=39 times.\n\nNow, for 8 in the units place in three-digit numbers:\n\nSimilarly, let's count how many times 8 appears in the units place.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 100-199. For each tens group, units digit 8 appears once. There are 10 tens groups, so 10 times.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2: 200-299. 10 times.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3: 300-399. 10 times.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Now, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, so 9 tens groups. In each, units digit 8 appears once, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total for 8 in the units place is 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds=4 case again. From 400-488, the tens digits are 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), ..., 8 (480-488). So, each of these tens groups will have a units digit 8 once, except maybe the last one if it's cut short. But 480-488 includes 488, which has units digit 8, so that's fine. So, 9 times in total for hundreds=4.\n\nSo, 39 times for 8 in the units place.\n\nNow, let me summarize the counts for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4: 89 times\n  - 8: 0 times\n\n- Tens place:\n  - 4: 40 times\n  - 8: 39 times\n\n- Units place:\n  - 4: 39 times\n  - 8: 39 times\n\nWait, let me check that again. Wait, earlier I thought for 4 in the tens place, it was 40 times, and for 8 in the tens place, it was 39 times. Similarly, for units place, both 4 and 8 appeared 39 times.\n\nWait, but wait, when I did the units place for 4, I got 39 times, and same for 8. But let me confirm that.\n\nWait, for 4 in the units place, hundreds=1,2,3 each contributed 10 times, and hundreds=4 contributed 9 times, so 3*10 + 9 = 39.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place, same logic: 3*10 +9=39.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's add up all the counts for 4 and 8 across all digit places.\n\nFirst, for 4:\n\n- One-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit:\n  - Hundreds: 89\n  - Tens: 40\n  - Units: 39\nTotal for 4: 1 + 19 + 89 + 40 + 39\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, in the two-digit numbers, we already included both tens and units places, so when we did two-digit numbers, we had 19 times for 4. Then, in three-digit numbers, we have hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nWait, perhaps I should separate the counts for each digit place across all ranges.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to consider each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers, not just splitting into one-digit, two-digit, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps that's a more systematic way to avoid confusion.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nSo, the total number of pages is 488, so page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nEach page number can be considered as a three-digit number with leading zeros, so 001 to 488. But leading zeros aren't actually printed, but for counting digits, it might help to think of them that way.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider each digit place separately.\n\nLet me try this approach:\n\n1. Units place: For each digit from 0-9, how many times does it appear in the units place from 1 to 488?\n\n2. Tens place: Similarly, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place.\n\n3. Hundreds place: How many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place.\n\nThen, I can sum the counts for 4 and 8 across all places.\n\nThis might be a more accurate way.\n\nSo, let's start with the units place.\n\nUnits place:\n\nEach digit from 0-9 appears equally in the units place, except possibly for the last partial group.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra numbers.\n\nIn each complete group of 10, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly once in the units place.\n\nSo, for the units place:\n\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the complete groups.\n\n- Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so digits 1-8 each appear once more, and 9 and 0 do not appear in the units place in this partial group.\n\nWait, but wait, 481-488 is 8 numbers: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, digits 1-8 each appear once more in the units place.\n\nSo, total counts for units place:\n\n- For digits 0: 48 times (since in the partial group, 0 doesn't appear)\n- For digits 1-8: 48 +1 =49 times each\n- For digits 9: 48 times\n\nWait, but wait, in the partial group, 481-488, units digits go up to 8, so 9 doesn't appear in the units place in the partial group. So, digits 1-8 get an extra count, while 0 and 9 do not.\n\nSo, units place counts:\n\n- 0: 48\n- 1: 49\n- 2: 49\n- 3: 49\n- 4: 49\n- 5: 49\n- 6: 49\n- 7: 49\n- 8: 49\n- 9: 48\n\nWait, but wait, from 1 to 488, the first number is 1, which is units digit 1, and the last is 488, units digit 8. So, yes, units digits 1-8 each appear one more time in the partial group.\n\nSo, for the units place, digit 4 appears 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, digit 8 appears 49 times in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach digit from 0-9 appears in the tens place in cycles of 100. Each cycle of 100 has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n\nSo, from 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nWait, actually, 488 is 4*100 + 88, so 4 complete hundreds and a partial hundred of 88 pages.\n\nIn each complete hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, for 4 complete hundreds, each digit appears 4*10=40 times.\n\nNow, in the partial hundred from 401 to 488, which is 88 pages, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). Wait, but 401-410 is 10 numbers, 411-420 is another 10, etc., up to 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nWait, let's think differently. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in the partial hundred from 401 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place?\n\nLet me list the tens digits:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 numbers)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 numbers)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 numbers)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 numbers)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 numbers)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 numbers)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 numbers)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 numbers)\n\nWait, but 401-410 is 10 numbers, so tens digit 0 appears 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, 411-420: 10 times for tens digit 1.\n\nContinuing up to 471-480: 10 times for tens digit 7.\n\nThen, 481-488: 8 numbers, so tens digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, in the partial hundred, each digit from 0-7 appears 10 times, and digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, for the tens place:\n\n- Digits 0-7: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from partial hundred) = 50 times each\n- Digit 8: 40 + 8 = 48 times\n- Digit 9: 40 times (since in the partial hundred, the tens digit doesn't reach 9)\n\nWait, but wait, in the partial hundred, the tens digits go up to 8, so digit 9 doesn't appear in the tens place in the partial hundred. So, digit 9 in the tens place only has the 40 from the complete hundreds.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. From 401-488, the tens digits are 0-8, so digit 9 doesn't appear. So, yes, digit 9 in the tens place is only from the complete hundreds.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\n- Digit 0: 50\n- Digit 1: 50\n- Digit 2: 50\n- Digit 3: 50\n- Digit 4: 50\n- Digit 5: 50\n- Digit 6: 50\n- Digit 7: 50\n- Digit 8: 48\n- Digit 9: 40\n\nSo, in the tens place, digit 4 appears 50 times, and digit 8 appears 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nThe hundreds digit is non-zero and can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, since the book goes up to 488.\n\nEach hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) contributes to the hundreds place.\n\n- For hundreds digit 1: 100-199, which is 100 numbers, so digit 1 appears 100 times in the hundreds place.\n- Hundreds digit 2: 200-299, another 100 numbers, so digit 2 appears 100 times.\n- Hundreds digit 3: 300-399, another 100 numbers, so digit 3 appears 100 times.\n- Hundreds digit 4: 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89), so digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- Digit 1: 100\n- Digit 2: 100\n- Digit 3: 100\n- Digit 4: 89\n- Digits 5-9: 0\n\nSo, digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and digit 8 doesn't appear at all in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for digits 4 and 8 across all places.\n\nStarting with digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nNow, digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal for 8: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nWait, but let me confirm these counts again.\n\nWait, for digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188\n\nFor digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 48 = 97\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me go through each place again.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- Digit 4: 49\n- Digit 8: 49\n\nTens place:\n\n- Digit 4: 50\n- Digit 8: 48\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- Digit 4: 89\n- Digit 8: 0\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but let me check if I made any mistake in the counts.\n\nWait, in the units place, from 1 to 488, the digit 4 appears 49 times, and 8 appears 49 times. That seems correct because in each complete group of 10, each digit appears once, and the partial group adds one more for digits 1-8.\n\nIn the tens place, digit 4 appears 50 times, digit 8 appears 48 times. That's because in the partial hundred, digit 8 in the tens place only appears 8 times instead of 10.\n\nIn the hundreds place, digit 4 appears 89 times, digit 8 doesn't appear.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's total: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nSo, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I was considering two-digit numbers, I thought that in two-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appeared 19 times each, which would add up to 19 for each in two-digit numbers. But when I approached it by digit places, I got different counts. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier by splitting into one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, let me see. In the digit place approach, I considered all numbers from 1 to 488, and that seems more accurate because it accounts for all possibilities without splitting into digit groups.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can cross-verify by another method.\n\nAnother way: Let's consider each digit place separately and count the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nAs before, 49 times each for 4 and 8.\n\nTens place:\n\n4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 48 times.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was considering two-digit numbers, I thought both 4 and 8 appeared 19 times each, but according to the digit place approach, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, which includes two-digit numbers and three-digit numbers. Similarly, in the units place, 49 times each, which includes all numbers.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial approach of splitting into one-digit, two-digit, etc., was leading me astray because I was not considering the three-digit numbers properly.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately, we determine that the digit 4 appears 188 times and the digit 8 appears 97 times. The difference is 91.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{91}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the approach here is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every group of ten numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in the range 1-99, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the units place. Wait, no, that's not quite right. From 1-9, the units digits are 1-9, so each digit appears once. Then from 10-99, each units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, for each ten (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the units digit 4 appears once. There are 9 tens (10-99), so that's 9 times. But wait, from 1-9, the units digit 4 appears once as well. So, total units place 4's from 1-99 would be 9 (from 10-99) + 1 (from 1-9) = 10 times.\n\nWait, actually, from 1-9, the units digit is the same as the page number, so 4 appears once. From 10-99, each ten has one 4 in the units place, so that's 9 times. So total units place 4's up to 99 would be 10. Then, from 100-488, the units digit cycles similarly. Let me think: how many groups of ten are there from 100-488? Well, 488 - 100 + 1 = 389 pages. So, that's 38 full tens (100-199, 200-299, etc.) and then some. Wait, no, from 100-488, each hundred has 100 pages, so 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, from 100-488, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. Now, for each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, for each hundred, the number of 4's in the units place would be 10 per hundred, right? Because in each ten, like 100-109, 110-119, etc., the units digit 4 appears once per ten, and there are 10 tens per hundred. So, 10 times per hundred. But wait, 400-488 is only 89 pages, so does that affect the count? Let me think.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate how many full tens there are and then handle the partial ten if necessary. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the number of times 4 appears in the units place from 100-488. Let's see: the number of tens from 100-488 is 488 - 100 + 1 = 389. But that's the total number of pages. Wait, no, I'm trying to find how many times the units digit is 4. So, for each hundred, from 100-199, there are 10 instances where the units digit is 4: 104, 114, ..., 194. Similarly, from 200-299, another 10, and so on up to 300-399, another 10. Then from 400-488, the units digit 4 would appear at 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, how many is that? Let's count: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times because 484 is the last one before 488. So, from 400-488, units digit 4 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total units place 4's from 100-488 would be 3 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contributing 10, so 3*10=30, plus 9 from 400-488, totaling 39. So, adding the 10 from 1-99, total units place 4's would be 10 + 39 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 1-99, units place 4's: 10. From 100-488, units place 4's: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39. So total units place 4's: 10 + 39 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred. For example, in 1-99, the tens digit cycles from 0 (for 1-9) and then 1-9 for 10-99. Wait, actually, from 1-9, the tens digit is 0, but in page numbers, I think 1-9 are single-digit, so maybe the tens digit doesn't exist? Hmm, maybe I should consider that the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, so the tens digit 4 would appear in 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this systematically. The tens digit is the second digit from the right. So, for page numbers 1-9, the tens digit is 0. From 10-99, the tens digit cycles 1-9, each appearing 10 times. From 100-488, the tens digit can be 0-9 for each hundred, but also considering the hundreds digit.\n\nSo, let's calculate the number of times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nFirst, from 1-99: The tens digit is 4 in the range 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nFrom 100-488: Let's break it down by hundreds.\n\n100-199: The tens digit 4 appears in 140-149, which is 10 times.\n\n200-299: Similarly, 240-249, 10 times.\n\n300-399: 340-349, 10 times.\n\n400-488: Now, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 times.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is entirely within 400-488, right? Yes, because 449 is less than 488.\n\nSo, from 100-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times in each hundred, and there are 4 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), but wait, 400-488 is not a full hundred, it's only up to 488. Wait, but as I thought earlier, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 times. So, total tens place 4's from 100-488 would be 4*10=40.\n\nWait, but wait: 100-199: 140-149 (10)\n200-299: 240-249 (10)\n300-399: 340-349 (10)\n400-488: 440-449 (10)\nSo, that's 4 sets of 10, totaling 40.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's from 1-99:10\nFrom 100-488:40\nTotal tens place 4's: 10 + 40 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is the third digit from the right. In this case, page numbers go up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place?\n\nWell, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, the number of pages from 400-488 is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Because each page from 400 to 488 has 4 as the hundreds digit, so yes, that's 89 times.\n\nSo, total hundreds place 4's:89.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's printed is 188.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. Okay.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. From 1-99, the units digit 8 appears once in each ten, so 9 times from 10-99 plus 1 from 1-9, totaling 10 times.\n\nFrom 100-488, the units digit 8 appears once every ten pages. So, how many times does it appear?\n\nIn each hundred, from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488, the units digit 8 appears 10 times per hundred, except possibly the last partial hundred.\n\nWait, let me calculate it properly.\n\nFrom 100-199: The units digit 8 appears in 108,118,...,198. That's 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, from 200-299:208,218,...,298:10 times.\n\nFrom 300-399:308,318,...,398:10 times.\n\nFrom 400-488: The units digit 8 appears in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 times because 488 is included.\n\nSo, total units place 8's from 100-488: 3*10 +9=39.\n\nAdding the 10 from 1-99, total units place 8's:10 +39=49.\n\nNow, tens place for 8's.\n\nFrom 1-99: The tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, which is 10 times.\n\nFrom 100-488: The tens digit 8 appears in each hundred's 80-89 range.\n\nSo, from 100-199:180-189:10 times.\n\n200-299:280-289:10 times.\n\n300-399:380-389:10 times.\n\n400-488:480-488: here, the tens digit is 8, so the pages would be 480-488. But 488 is the last page, so how many numbers is that? 488 - 480 +1 =9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in 400-488.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's from 100-488:3*10 +9=39.\n\nAdding the 10 from 1-99, total tens place 8's:10 +39=49.\n\nNow, hundreds place for 8's.\n\nIn the hundreds place, the digit 8 appears only in page numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's:0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 49 +49=98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units and tens each had 49, so total 98. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the units place for 8's. From 1-99:10, from 100-488:39, total 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: from 1-99:10, from 100-488:39, total 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:0. So, total 8's:98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, counting 4's:\n\nUnits place:49\nTens place:50\nHundreds place:89\nTotal:49+50=99; 99+89=188. Correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nUnits place:49\nTens place:49\nHundreds place:0\nTotal:49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 pages, right? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place, 4's: in each hundred, 10 times, and there are 4 hundreds (100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, but in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, so that's correct. So, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Plus the 10 from 1-99, total 50. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's:10 from 1-99, and 39 from 100-488, total 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, units and tens each have 49, so total 98. Correct.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll break it down by the number of digits:\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Here, only page 4 has a 4. So that's 1 occurrence.\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):** For two-digit numbers, the 4 can appear in the tens place or the units place. \n\n   - **Tens place:** From 40 to 49, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So that's 10 occurrences.\n   \n   - **Units place:** The 4 can appear in the units place for numbers like 14, 24, 34, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\n   So, in total, for two-digit pages, there are 10 + 9 = 19 occurrences of 4.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):** Now, this is more complex. Let's break it down by hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\n   - **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. However, when the hundreds digit is 4, the numbers go from 400 to 488. So, let's handle this carefully.\n\n     - When hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3: For each of these, the hundreds digit is fixed, and we can have 4's in the tens or units place. Let's calculate how many 4's appear in the tens and units places for each hundred.\n\n       - **Tens place:** For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit can be 4, which gives 10 numbers each (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). So that's 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 occurrences.\n\n       - **Units place:** Similarly, for each hundred, the units digit can be 4, which gives 1 number per ten (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194; same for 200s and 300s). Since there are 10 tens per hundred, that's 10 numbers per hundred. So, 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 occurrences.\n\n     - Now, when the hundreds digit is 4 (400-488):\n\n       - **Tens place:** Here, the tens digit can be 0 to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, the 4 can appear in the tens place as 40-49 in the hundreds place, but since we're in 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8. Wait, actually, the tens digit can be 0 to 8, but the 4 in the tens place would be from 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\n       - **Units place:** The units digit can be 0-9, but since we're only going up to 488, the units digit goes up to 8 when the tens digit is 8. But for the units digit being 4, it's from 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, 484 is within 488, so that's 9 numbers. Hmm, let me check: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Yes, that's 9 occurrences because after 484, the next would be 494, which is beyond 488.\n\n       Wait, but actually, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can go up to 8 (since 488 is the last page), so the units digit for 4 can be 4 in 404, 414, ..., 484. Let me count these:\n\n       Starting from 400-488, the numbers ending with 4 are 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. So, 9 occurrences in the units place.\n\n       Additionally, in the tens place, when the tens digit is 4, we have 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 occurrences.\n\n       So, in the hundreds place being 4, we have 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 occurrences.\n\n   - So, adding up all the three-digit pages:\n\n     - Hundreds digits 1,2,3: 30 (tens) + 30 (units) = 60\n     - Hundreds digit 4: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n     - Total for three-digit pages: 60 + 19 = 79 occurrences.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me double-check the hundreds digit 4 part. When the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can be 0-8, so when the tens digit is 4, we have 440-449, which is 10 numbers. That's correct. For the units digit, from 400-488, the units digit can be 4 in 404, 414, ..., 484. Let me count how many that is. From 404 to 484, each step is 10, so that's (484 - 404)/10 + 1 = (80)/10 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 numbers. So that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit pages: 60 (from 100-399) + 19 (from 400-488) = 79.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 79\nTotal 4's = 1 + 19 + 79 = 99.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again. Maybe I overcounted somewhere.\n\nWait, in the two-digit pages, I had 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. That seems right because from 40-49, that's 10, and 14,24,34,54,64,74,84,94, which is 9. So 19 is correct.\n\nIn three-digit pages, for hundreds digits 1-3, each contributes 10 (tens) + 10 (units) = 20 per hundred, so 3 \u00d7 20 = 60. That's correct.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4, tens place: 10 (440-449), units place: 9 (404,414,...,484). So 19. So 60 + 19 = 79. That seems correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 1 + 19 + 79 = 99. Hmm.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach.\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 8 has an 8. So that's 1 occurrence.\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):** \n\n   - **Tens place:** From 80-89, that's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n   \n   - **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place for numbers like 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. Wait, 88 has two 8's, but I'm counting each occurrence. So, from 18,28,...,98, that's 9 numbers, but 88 has two 8's. So, how many 8's in the units place? Let's see: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 except 88, which contributes two. So, total 9 + 1 = 10 occurrences in the units place.\n\n   So, for two-digit pages, 10 (tens) + 10 (units) = 20 occurrences.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):** Again, breaking down by hundreds, tens, and units.\n\n   - **Hundreds digit 1,2,3:**\n\n     - **Tens place:** For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit can be 8, giving 10 numbers each (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, 380-389). So 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 occurrences.\n\n     - **Units place:** For each hundred, the units digit can be 8, giving 10 numbers per hundred (e.g., 108,118,...,198; same for 200s and 300s). So, 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 occurrences.\n\n   - **Hundreds digit 4 (400-488):**\n\n     - **Tens place:** The tens digit can be 8, giving 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 occurrences.\n\n     - **Units place:** The units digit can be 8. Let's see, from 400-488, numbers ending with 8 are 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8. But 488 has two 8's (tens and units), so does that mean an extra occurrence? Wait, no, because in the units place count, 488 is included as ending with 8, so it's one occurrence in the units place. But in the tens place, 488 is also counted as having 8 in the tens place. So, in the units place, we have 9 numbers, each contributing one 8, so 9 occurrences.\n\n   So, for hundreds digit 4:\n\n     - Tens place: 9\n     - Units place: 9\n     - Total: 18.\n\n   Now, adding up all three-digit pages:\n\n     - Hundreds digits 1,2,3: 30 (tens) + 30 (units) = 60\n     - Hundreds digit 4: 9 (tens) + 9 (units) = 18\n     - Total for three-digit pages: 60 + 18 = 78.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds digit 4 part again. When the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can be 8, which gives 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is included). So, 9 occurrences in the tens place.\n\nFor the units place, numbers ending with 8 in 400-488 are 408,418,...,488. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, 9 + 9 = 18.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit pages: 60 + 18 = 78.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 20\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal 8's = 1 + 20 + 78 = 99.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the problem says how many more 4's than 8's, and if both are 99, the difference would be zero. That seems unlikely. I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me go back and check.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1 (correct)\n- Two-digit: tens place 40-49 (10), units place 14,24,34,54,64,74,84,94 (9). Total 19 (correct)\n- Three-digit:\n  - Hundreds 1-3:\n    - Tens place: 10 each \u00d7 3 = 30\n    - Units place: 10 each \u00d7 3 = 30\n    - Total: 60\n  - Hundreds 4:\n    - Tens place: 440-449 (10)\n    - Units place: 404,414,...,484 (9)\n    - Total: 19\n  - So, 60 + 19 = 79\n- Total 4's: 1 + 19 + 79 = 99 (correct)\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1 (correct)\n- Two-digit:\n  - Tens place: 80-89 (10)\n  - Units place: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. Wait, 88 is included, which has two 8's, so does that mean I should count each occurrence? Let's see, the units place 8's are from 18,28,...,98, which is 9 numbers, each contributing one 8, except 88, which contributes two. So, total units place 8's: 9 + 1 = 10? Wait, no. Wait, 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, but 88 has two 8's, so the total number of 8's in the units place is 10: one from each number except 88, which has two, so 9 +1 =10? Wait, no, that's not correct. Each number contributes one 8 in the units place, except 88, which contributes two. So, the total number of 8's in the units place is 9 (from 18,28,...,98) plus one extra from 88, making it 10. So, units place: 10.\n\n  So, two-digit 8's: 10 (tens) +10 (units) =20 (correct)\n  \n- Three-digit:\n  - Hundreds 1-3:\n    - Tens place: 10 each \u00d73 =30\n    - Units place: 10 each \u00d73 =30\n    - Total:60\n  - Hundreds 4:\n    - Tens place: 480-488 (9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in tens place)\n    - Units place: 408,418,...,488 (9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in units place)\n    - So, 9 +9=18\n  - Total three-digit 8's:60 +18=78\n- Total 8's:1 +20 +78=99\n\nWait, so both 4's and 8's are 99? That can't be right because the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's, implying there is a difference. I must have made a mistake in counting either 4's or 8's.\n\nLet me check the three-digit 8's again. For hundreds digit 4:\n\n- Tens place: 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Each has 8 in the tens place, so 9 occurrences.\n\n- Units place: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the units place. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, 9 +9=18. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but 488 is included in both counts. So, in the tens place, 488 is counted once, and in the units place, it's counted once. So, 488 contributes two 8's, which is correct.\n\nSo, 18 occurrences in hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, total 8's:1 (single) +20 (two-digit) +78 (three-digit)=99.\n\nWait, but 4's are also 99. So, the difference would be zero. But the problem says \"how many more 4's than 8's,\" so maybe I made a mistake in the 4's count.\n\nLet me check the 4's again.\n\nIn three-digit pages, hundreds digit 4:\n\n- Tens place: 440-449 (10 numbers)\n- Units place: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers.\n\nSo, 10 +9=19.\n\nWait, but 484 is included, which is correct because 484 is less than 488. So, 9 numbers.\n\nSo, 19 in hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, three-digit 4's:60 (from 1-3) +19=79.\n\nTotal 4's:1 +19 +79=99.\n\nHmm, that's correct. So, both 4's and 8's are 99. So, the difference is zero.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive. Maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, let me recount the 8's in the three-digit pages, hundreds digit 4.\n\n- Tens place: 480-488. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the tens place.\n\n- Units place: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the units place.\n\nSo, 9 +9=18.\n\nBut wait, 488 is included in both, so it's correct.\n\nSo, 18 in hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, three-digit 8's:60 +18=78.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 78, but then adding single and two-digit gives 1 +20 +78=99.\n\nWait, but 4's are 99, 8's are 99, so difference is zero.\n\nBut the problem says \"how many more 4's than 8's,\" so perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I overcounted the 8's in the two-digit units place.\n\nWait, in two-digit numbers, units place 8's:18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, but 88 has two 8's, so the total number of 8's in units place is 10, not 9. Because each of the 9 numbers contributes one 8, but 88 contributes an extra one, making it 10.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98: that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But 88 has two 8's, so the total number of 8's in the units place is 10, because 88 contributes two. So, units place 8's:10.\n\nSo, two-digit 8's:10 (tens) +10 (units)=20.\n\nSo, total 8's:1 +20 +78=99.\n\nWait, so 4's are 99, 8's are 99, so the difference is zero. But the problem says \"how many more 4's than 8's,\" so perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscounted the three-digit 8's.\n\nWait, in three-digit pages, hundreds digit 4, units place:408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSimilarly, tens place:480-488, which is 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo, 9 +9=18.\n\nSo, 60 (from 1-3) +18=78.\n\nSo, 8's total:1 +20 +78=99.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the 4's count.\n\nWait, in three-digit pages, hundreds digit 4, units place:404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place.\n\nBut wait, 484 is within 488, so that's correct.\n\nSo, 9 occurrences.\n\nSimilarly, tens place:440-449, which is 10 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the tens place.\n\nSo, 10 +9=19.\n\nSo, 4's total:1 +19 +79=99.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that 488 is included in both 4's and 8's counts, but I think that's correct because 488 has both 8's and 4's.\n\nWait, but 488 has two 8's and one 4? No, 488 is 4-8-8, so it has one 4 and two 8's.\n\nWait, so in the 4's count, 484 is included, which is 4-8-4, so that's two 4's in 484. Wait, no, 484 is 4 in the hundreds, 8 in the tens, and 4 in the units. So, each digit is counted separately. So, in 484, the hundreds digit is 4 (counted once), the tens digit is 8 (counted once), and the units digit is 4 (counted once). So, in the 4's count, 484 contributes two 4's: one in the hundreds place and one in the units place. Wait, no, in the hundreds digit 4, we're only counting the hundreds digit as 4, which is 400-488. So, in 484, the hundreds digit is 4, which is already counted in the hundreds digit 4's. Wait, no, I think I'm confusing the breakdown.\n\nWait, no, in the three-digit pages, when I'm counting 4's, I broke it down into hundreds digit 1-3 and 4. So, for hundreds digit 4, the 4's in the hundreds place are from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 +1=89). But I'm only counting the 4's in the hundreds place once, which is 89 occurrences. Wait, no, that's not correct because in the hundreds digit 4, each number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. But I didn't count that; I only counted the 4's in the tens and units places for hundreds digit 4. So, I think I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, I think I see the mistake now. Earlier, when counting 4's, I only considered the 4's in the tens and units places for three-digit numbers, but I didn't count the 4's in the hundreds place for 400-488. So, in fact, the hundreds digit 4 contributes 89 4's (from 400-488), which is a huge number, making the total 4's much higher than 99.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because I thought I was only counting the 4's in the tens and units places. Let me clarify.\n\nNo, wait, when I broke down the three-digit pages, I considered the hundreds digit 1-3 and 4, and for each, I counted the 4's in the tens and units places. But I didn't count the 4's in the hundreds place because I assumed that the hundreds digit being 4 is only for the range 400-488, and I didn't count the hundreds digit itself as a 4. Wait, but that's incorrect because the hundreds digit being 4 is part of the page number, so each page from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, which is a 4. So, I should have counted those as well.\n\nSo, I think I made a mistake by not counting the hundreds digit 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, let's recalculate the 4's.\n\nFor three-digit pages:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1-3: each contributes 20 4's (10 in tens, 10 in units) as before.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: \n\n  - Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences.\n  \n  - Tens place: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the tens place.\n  \n  - Units place: 404,414,...,484, which is 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place.\n\nSo, total for hundreds digit 4:\n\n- Hundreds place:89\n- Tens place:10\n- Units place:9\nTotal:89 +10 +9=108.\n\nSo, total three-digit 4's:\n\n- Hundreds 1-3:60\n- Hundreds 4:108\nTotal:60 +108=168.\n\nNow, adding single and two-digit 4's:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit:168\nTotal 4's:1 +19 +168=188.\n\nNow, let's recount the 8's correctly, considering that I might have missed something.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n\n- Two-digit:\n\n  - Tens place:80-89 (10)\n  \n  - Units place:18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the units place, except 88, which contributes two. So, total units place 8's:9 +1=10.\n\n  So, two-digit 8's:10 +10=20.\n\n- Three-digit:\n\n  - Hundreds digits 1-3:\n\n    - Tens place:10 each \u00d73=30\n    \n    - Units place:10 each \u00d73=30\n    \n    Total:60\n\n  - Hundreds digit 4:\n\n    - Tens place:480-488 (9 numbers)\n    \n    - Units place:408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488 (9 numbers)\n    \n    So, 9 +9=18.\n\n  - Total three-digit 8's:60 +18=78.\n\nSo, total 8's:1 +20 +78=99.\n\nWait, so 4's are 188 and 8's are 99. So, the difference is 188 -99=89.\n\nWait, that makes sense because the hundreds digit 4 contributes 89 4's in the hundreds place alone, which is a significant number.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. From 400-488, there are 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's right there. Then, in the tens and units places, we have additional 4's. So, 89 +10 (tens) +9 (units)=108 in three-digit pages for 4's. Plus the single and two-digit 4's:1 +19=20. So, total 4's:108 +20=128? Wait, no, wait, no, earlier I added 60 (from 1-3) +108 (from 4)=168. Then, 1 +19 +168=188.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Then, in the tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place, so 10 more. In the units place, 404,414,...,484 is 9 numbers, each with a 4 in the units place, so 9 more. So, 89 +10 +9=108 in three-digit pages for 4's.\n\nAdditionally, in single-digit:1, two-digit:19, so total 4's:108 +1 +19=128.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 60 (from 1-3) +108=168. That seems conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the breakdown. Let me clarify:\n\nWhen counting three-digit 4's, I should separate the hundreds digit 4's from the other hundreds.\n\nSo, for three-digit pages:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1-3: each contributes 20 4's (10 in tens, 10 in units) as before. So, 3 \u00d720=60.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: \n\n  - Hundreds place:89 (400-488)\n  \n  - Tens place:10 (440-449)\n  \n  - Units place:9 (404,414,...,484)\n  \n  So, total for hundreds digit 4:89 +10 +9=108.\n\nSo, total three-digit 4's:60 +108=168.\n\nThen, adding single and two-digit 4's:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n\n- Two-digit:19\n\nTotal 4's:1 +19 +168=188.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, 8's are 99 as before.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -99=89.\n\nSo, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 99. The difference is 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each section: single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit pages.\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 4 has a 4. So, that's 1 occurrence.\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):** Here, the 4 can appear in the tens place or the units place. \n\n   - **Tens place:** Pages 40-49. That's 10 pages, each with a 4 in the tens place. So, 10 occurrences.\n   \n   - **Units place:** Pages where the units digit is 4, like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but from 10-99, that's 9 pages. But page 44 has two 4's, so I need to make sure I'm not double-counting. However, since I'm just counting the number of 4's, each occurrence is counted separately. So, 9 occurrences from the units place.\n\n   So, total 4's in two-digit pages: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):** Now, this is a bit more complex because each page number has three digits. The 4 can appear in the hundreds, tens, or units place.\n\n   - **Hundreds place:** Pages 100-488. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for hundreds digit 4, it's pages 400-488. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\n   - **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens digit. The tens place can be 0-9, and we're interested in when it's 4. For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0-9. \n\n     - For hundreds 1, 2, 3: Each hundred has pages where the tens digit is 4, which is 40-49 in each hundred. Each of these contributes 10 pages. So, 10 pages per hundred, times 3 hundreds: 30 occurrences.\n\n     - For hundreds 4: Pages 400-488. The tens digit being 4 would be pages 440-449. That's 10 pages. So, 10 occurrences.\n\n     Total for tens place: 30 + 10 = 40.\n\n   - **Units place:** Similarly, the units digit can be 0-9, and we're looking for when it's 4. Again, for each hundred:\n\n     - Hundreds 1, 2, 3: Each hundred has 10 pages where the units digit is 4 (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194; same for 200s and 300s). So, 10 per hundred, times 3: 30.\n\n     - Hundreds 4: Pages 400-488. The units digit is 4 on pages 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, let me count: from 400-488, how many times does the units digit 4 occur? It should be every 10 pages, so starting at 404, then 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 pages because 484 is the last one before 494, which is beyond 488. Wait, but 404 is the first, then each 10 pages up to 484. So, from 404 to 484, how many steps of 10? Let's see: (484 - 404)/10 + 1 = (80)/10 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9. So, 9 occurrences.\n\n     So, total for units place: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39.\n\n   Now, adding up all the 4's in three-digit pages: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89 + 40 = 129, 129 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check the three-digit part because it's easy to make a mistake there.\n\nWait, maybe I overcounted the three-digit pages. Let me think again.\n\nIn the hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 4's.\n\nIn the tens place: For hundreds 1, 2, 3, each has 10 pages where the tens digit is 4 (like 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). That's 10 each, so 30. Then, for hundreds 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 30 + 10 = 40. That seems correct.\n\nIn the units place: For hundreds 1, 2, 3, each has 10 pages where the units digit is 4, so 30. For hundreds 4, it's 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 pages, as 484 is the last one before 494, which is beyond 488. So, 9. So, 30 + 9 = 39. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit pages: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. So, 168 4's in three-digit pages.\n\nNow, total 4's in the entire book: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1 + 19 = 20, 20 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the three-digit count.\n\nWait, let me think about the three-digit pages again. From 100 to 488.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488: 89 pages, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nTens place: For hundreds 1,2,3: each has 10 pages where tens digit is 4, so 10*3=30.\n\nFor hundreds 4: tens digit 4 is 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10.\n\nTotal tens place: 30 + 10 = 40.\n\nUnits place: For hundreds 1,2,3: each has 10 pages where units digit is 4, so 10*3=30.\n\nFor hundreds 4: units digit 4 occurs on pages 404,414,...,484. How many? From 404 to 484, step 10. So, (484 - 404)/10 +1 = 8 +1 =9. So, 9.\n\nTotal units place: 30 +9=39.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168. So, yes, 168 4's in three-digit pages.\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 (single) +19 (two-digit) +168= 188.\n\nWait, but let me check the two-digit pages again. From 10-99.\n\nTens place: 40-49: 10 pages, so 10 4's.\n\nUnits place: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 pages, each contributing one 4, except 44 which has two 4's. Wait, but in the units place, each occurrence is counted, so 9 4's in the units place. So, total 19 4's in two-digit pages. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 +19 +168=188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nI'll go through the same sections: single-digit, two-digit, three-digit.\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 8 has an 8. So, 1 occurrence.\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):** 8 can appear in tens place or units place.\n\n   - **Tens place:** Pages 80-89: 10 pages, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, 10 occurrences.\n\n   - **Units place:** Pages where the units digit is 8, like 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 pages. Again, page 88 has two 8's, but we're counting each occurrence, so 9.\n\n   So, total 8's in two-digit pages:10 +9=19.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):** Again, hundreds, tens, units.\n\n   - **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 1,2,3,4. So, 8 can't be in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, and hundreds digits are 1,2,3,4. So, no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\n   - **Tens place:** For each hundred (100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488), the tens digit can be 8.\n\n     - Hundreds 1,2,3: Each has pages where tens digit is 8, which is 80-89 in each hundred. So, 10 pages per hundred, times 3:30.\n\n     - Hundreds 4: Pages 400-488. The tens digit 8 is in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. That's 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, 9 occurrences.\n\n     So, total tens place:30 +9=39.\n\n   - **Units place:** For each hundred, units digit 8 occurs every 10 pages.\n\n     - Hundreds 1,2,3: Each has 10 pages where units digit is 8, so 10*3=30.\n\n     - Hundreds 4: Pages 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So, 9.\n\n     So, total units place:30 +9=39.\n\n   Now, adding up all the 8's in three-digit pages: tens place (39) + units place (39) =78.\n\nWait, but let me check again. For hundreds 4, tens place: 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: 408,418,...,488. How many? From 408 to 488, step 10. So, (488 - 408)/10 +1=8 +1=9. So, 9.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit pages:39 (tens) +39 (units)=78.\n\nSo, total 8's in the entire book: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78)=1 +19=20, 20 +78=98.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nSo, now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all the counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19\n- Three-digit:89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units)=168\nTotal:1+19=20 +168=188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19\n- Three-digit:39 (tens) +39 (units)=78\nTotal:1+19=20 +78=98\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the three-digit 4's. Let me think again.\n\nIn three-digit pages, hundreds place:400-488:89 pages, so 89 4's.\n\nTens place: For hundreds 1,2,3: each has 10 pages with tens digit 4, so 3*10=30.\n\nFor hundreds 4:440-449:10 pages, so 10.\n\nTotal tens:30+10=40.\n\nUnits place: For hundreds 1,2,3: each has 10 pages with units digit 4, so 3*10=30.\n\nFor hundreds 4:404,414,...,484:9 pages.\n\nTotal units:30+9=39.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in three-digit:\n\nTens place: hundreds 1,2,3:3*10=30.\n\nHundreds 4:480-488:9 pages.\n\nTotal tens:39.\n\nUnits place: hundreds 1,2,3:3*10=30.\n\nHundreds 4:408,418,...,488:9 pages.\n\nTotal units:39.\n\nSo, 39+39=78.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the three-digit 4's. Because from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so 89 pages. Then, in the tens place, for hundreds 1,2,3, each has 10 pages with tens digit 4, so 30. And for hundreds 4, tens digit 4 is 440-449:10 pages. So, 30+10=40.\n\nSimilarly, units place:30 (from 100-399) +9 (from 400-488)=39.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the first thing I need to do is count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers, and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have those totals, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in each set of 10 consecutive pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. That means, for the units digit, the number of times 4 appears is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 pages, plus any extra pages beyond that. Similarly for 8.\n\nBut wait, the page numbers start at 1, so the first group is 1-9, which is only 9 pages. Hmm, so maybe I should adjust for that. Let me think. The page numbers go from 1 to 488, which is 488 pages. So, the number of complete groups of 10 in the units place would be 48 full groups (since 48*10=480), and then 8 extra pages (481-488). \n\nWait, but actually, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 pages. But since page numbers start at 1, the first group (1-9) doesn't include 0 in the units place. So, maybe I should calculate it differently.\n\nLet me approach it systematically. For the units digit:\n\n- From 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of times the units digit cycles through 0-9, which is every 10 pages. So, for each 10 pages, 4 appears once. \n\nSo, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 complete groups and 8 extra pages. In each group, 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, 4 doesn't appear in the units place in the extra pages. Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, it's the same calculation. Each group of 10 pages has one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. In the extra 8 pages, the units digits go up to 8, so page 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more 8. Therefore, the total number of 8's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check. From 1 to 480, each group of 10 contributes one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total 8's in units place is 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive pages. For example, from 10-19, the tens digit is 1, so 10 times. Similarly, from 20-29, tens digit is 2, and so on.\n\nSo, for the tens place, the number of times 4 appears is equal to the number of complete hundreds, plus any partial hundreds if applicable. Let's see.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the hundreds digits go from 0 (for pages 1-99) to 4 (for pages 400-488). So, the tens digit cycles every 100 pages. \n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- Pages 1-99: The tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. Therefore, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place for pages 40-49, and 10 times for each hundred. Wait, no, actually, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nBut since we're only going up to 488, which is 4 hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, 488 is in the 400s, so actually, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 400-488.\n\nWait, no, 1-99 is the first hundred, 100-199 is the second, 200-299 is the third, 300-399 is the fourth, and 400-488 is part of the fifth hundred. But since 488 is less than 500, we don't have a complete fifth hundred.\n\nSo, for each complete hundred (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, 4 times 10 = 40 times for the complete hundreds.\n\nNow, for the partial hundred from 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 400-488. Therefore, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times in this partial hundred as well.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50 times.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check again. Each complete hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, 4 appears 10 times per hundred, and there are 4 complete hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so that's another 10. So, total 50 times.\n\nNow, for the digit 8 in the tens place. Similarly, each complete hundred contributes 10 times for 8 in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, 4 complete hundreds give 4*10=40 times. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the partial hundred.\n\nTherefore, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, let me make sure. From 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 8, the pages are 480-488, which is 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, so far, for the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present in three-digit numbers, from 100 onwards. The hundreds digit cycles every 1000 pages, but since our book is only 488 pages, the hundreds digit goes from 1 to 4 (for pages 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n\nSo, for the hundreds place:\n\n- The digit 4 appears only in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. How many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages, so the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, no. The hundreds digit is 4 for each page from 400 to 488. So, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. Therefore, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. The highest hundreds digit is 4. So, the digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in the hundreds place: 89 times.\n\nTotal 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 48 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 times\n\nFor the digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's are printed than 8's, we subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's:\n\n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- For 4: Each group of 10 pages contributes 1, so 48 groups (480 pages) give 48. The last 8 pages (481-488) don't include a 4 in the units place. So, 48.\n- For 8: Each group of 10 gives 1, so 48. The last 8 pages include 488, which has an 8 in the units place, so +1, totaling 49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 4: Each hundred contributes 10, so 4 hundreds give 40. The last partial hundred (400-488) includes 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 40 +10=50.\n- For 8: Each hundred contributes 10, so 4 hundreds give 40. The last partial hundred includes 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- For 4: 89 times (pages 400-488).\n- For 8: 0 times.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 48 +50 +89=187\n8's:49 +49 +0=98\n\nDifference: 187-98=89\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 89 more than the number of 8's.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by counting the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position separately.\n\nStarting with units digit:\n\nTotal number of units digits from 1 to 488: Each digit 0-9 appears equally except for the last partial group. Since 488 is not a multiple of 10, the units digits from 1 to 9 appear 48 times, and 0 appears 48 times as well, but starting from page 10.\n\nWait, no, actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 pages. So, the number of times each digit 0-9 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10, which is 48, plus any extra digits in the last partial group.\n\nBut since we start at 1, the first group is 1-9, so the units digits 1-9 appear once, and 0 doesn't appear until page 10. So, for units digits:\n\n- Digits 1-9: Each appears 48 times (from 10 groups of 10, but starting from 1, so actually, from 1-480, each digit 1-9 appears 48 times, and then in 481-488, digits 1-8 appear once each, and 9 doesn't appear because 488 is the last page.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should use a formula.\n\nThe formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is:\n\nNumber of times = floor((n + 1) / 10) if d \u2260 0, else floor(n / 10).\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think.\n\nActually, for the units digit, the number of times a digit d (0-9) appears from 1 to n is:\n\nIf d \u2260 0: floor((n + 9 - d) / 10)\nIf d = 0: floor((n - 1) / 10)\n\nWait, I'm not sure. Maybe a better approach is to calculate how many complete decades there are and then see if the incomplete decade includes the digit.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the number of complete decades (groups of 10) is 48 (since 48*10=480). Each complete decade contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8. So, in the incomplete decade, 4 doesn't appear, but 8 does.\n\nTherefore, number of 4's in units place: 48\nNumber of 8's in units place: 48 +1=49\n\nThat's consistent with what I found earlier.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, the number of times a digit d appears is calculated by considering each hundred. Each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times. Then, for the incomplete hundred (400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0-8. So, for 4, it appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. For 8, it appears in 480-488, which is 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total for tens place:\n\n4's: 4*10 (from four complete hundreds) +10 (from 400-488) =50\n8's:4*10 +9=49\n\nAgain, consistent.\n\nFor the hundreds place, it's simpler. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, 4 appears 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place since the book only goes up to 488.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:48 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=187\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98\n\nDifference:187-98=89\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 89 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Identify the ranges of page numbers:**\n   - Pages 1-9: Single-digit numbers.\n   - Pages 10-99: Two-digit numbers.\n   - Pages 100-488: Three-digit numbers.\n\n2. **Count occurrences of each digit in each place (units, tens, hundreds):**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n     - Total complete groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 (since 48*10=480).\n     - Pages 481-488: Units digits 1-8.\n     - **4's:** 48 times.\n     - **8's:** 48 (from complete groups) +1 (page 488) =49 times.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each digit appears 10 times per hundred.\n     - Complete hundreds: 4 (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399).\n     - **4's:** 4*10=40.

    "text": " \n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each of these ranges and do the same for the digit 8, then subtract the two totals to find the difference. Let me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, let's tackle the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. \n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). \n\nIn each complete block, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 times each. Then, in the partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial block, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). \n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 48 (from complete blocks) + 1 (from partial) = 49. \nTotal 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. \n\nHmm, so so far, the count for 4's and 8's in the units place is the same. Let's move on to the tens place. \n\nFor the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers. For example, from 10-19, the tens digit is 1, from 20-29 it's 2, and so on. \n\nSo, in each block of 100 numbers, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers. \n\nBut since our book goes up to 488, which is less than 500, I'll need to adjust for that. Let's see, how many complete hundreds are there? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred from 401-488. \n\nIn each complete hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for the digit 4, in each hundred, it appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49 in each hundred). Similarly, for the digit 8, it appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89 in each hundred). \n\nSo, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 times each. Now, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 480-488). So, in this partial block, the digit 4 appears in the tens place from 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, does it? Wait, 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440 is within 401-488, so yes, that's 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9. So, the digit 8 in the tens place appears 9 times in the partial hundred. \n\nWait, let me check that again. The partial hundred is 401-488. So, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But 440 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers. For the digit 8 in the tens place, it's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 9 times. \n\nSo, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from partial) = 50 times. The digit 8 appears 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from partial) = 49 times. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Each complete hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40 each. The partial hundred from 401-488: for the digit 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so +10. For 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so +9. So, yes, 4's: 50, 8's: 49 in the tens place. \n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers from 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, but since we're considering page numbers starting from 1, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, and then 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. \n\nSo, for the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit only goes up to 4, so the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, the count for 8's in the hundreds place is 0. \n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place: 4's: 89, 8's: 0. \n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences for each digit. \n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the question is asking how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nStarting with units place: 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, the partial block from 481-488: 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So, units place: 48 +1=49 for 4's, same for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each complete hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 40 each. The partial hundred 401-488: 440-449 is 10 numbers, so +10 for 4's, and 480-488 is 9 numbers, so +9 for 8's. So, 4's: 50, 8's:49. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. 8's: 0. \n\nSo, total 4's: 49 +50 +89 = 188\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the structure of page numbers:**\n   - Pages 1-9: single-digit.\n   - Pages 10-99: two-digit.\n   - Pages 100-488: three-digit.\n\n2. **Count occurrences of 4 and 8 in each digit place:**\n   - **Units place:**\n     - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n     - Total blocks of 10: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n     - Partial block (481-488): 484 has a 4, 488 has an 8.\n     - Total 4's in units place: 48 +1 =49.\n     - Total 8's in units place: 48 +1 =49.\n\n   - **Tens place:**\n     - Each hundred contains 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n     - Complete hundreds (1-400): 4 hundreds \u00d710 =40 each.\n     - Partial hundred (401-488):\n       - 4's: 440-449 (10 numbers).\n       - 8's: 480-488 (9 numbers).\n     - Total 4's in tens place:40 +10=50.\n     - Total 8's in tens place:40 +9=49.\n\n   - **Hundreds place:**\n     - 4's: 400-488 (89 numbers).\n     - 8's: None, as the book ends at 488.\n     - Total 4's in hundreds place:89.\n     - Total 8's in hundreds place:0.\n\n3. **Summarize the totals:**\n   - Total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n   - Total 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\n4. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the difference. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such sets are there? Since the book goes up to 488, the last set is 481-490, but we stop at 488. So, the number of complete sets of ten is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8). But wait, actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) up to 488. \n\nWait, let me think again. The number of times a digit appears in the units place is equal to the number of times the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, for each hundred, the units digit cycles 10 times. So, from 1 to 488, how many hundreds are there? Let's see, 1-99 is the first hundred, 100-199 the second, 200-299 the third, 300-399 the fourth, and 400-488 is part of the fifth hundred. \n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to calculate the number of times 4 appears in each digit place separately.\n\nSo, for the units place: For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete tens and a partial set of 8 numbers (481-488). But wait, actually, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete tens, which is 48, plus one more if the last partial set includes a 4. Let me check: the last partial set is 481-488, which includes 484 as the 4 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, no, actually, for units place, it's every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 is not a multiple of 10, we have to check if the last partial set includes a 4. The last partial set is 481-488, which includes 484, so that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, for the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the blocks are 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440 is 440, so 440-449 is 10 numbers, so yes, 5 blocks. So, 5*10=50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4, for every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Using the same method: floor(488/10)=48, and check if the last partial set (481-488) includes an 8. Yes, 488 is included, so that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's calculate:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98.\n\nWait, but when I calculated the tens place for 8's, I had 49, but let me confirm that. For each hundred block:\n\n- 1-99: 80-89: 10\n- 100-199: 180-189:10\n- 200-299:280-289:10\n- 300-399:380-389:10\n- 400-488:480-488:9\n\nSo, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4's, I had 188, and for 8's, 98. So, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nFor the tens place of 4's: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these blocks is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488 ends with 8, the last partial set is 481-488, which includes 484, so one more, total 49. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: same as 4's, 49.\n\nTens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). Total 49.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nSo, total 8's:98.\n\nThus, difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when counting the units place for 4's, I considered 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, and then one more in the last partial set. So, 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, same logic:49.\n\nSo, yes, 90 seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me think if there's another way to approach this, maybe using a formula or a different counting method to confirm.\n\nAnother approach is to consider each digit place separately and calculate the number of times each digit appears.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is given by:\n\nfloor(N/10) + (1 if the units digit of N >= d else 0)\n\nBut wait, that's not exactly accurate. Let me think.\n\nActually, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is:\n\nIf d=0, it's a bit different, but for d=4 and d=8, it's:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(N/10). Each group contributes one occurrence of d in the units place. Then, check the remainder: if the remainder is >= d, add 1.\n\nWait, but actually, for d=4, it's:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in units place = floor((N + 1)/10) * 1 + (if (N % 10) >= 4 then 1 else 0).\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think as:\n\nFor units place, the number of times d appears is:\n\ncount = (N // 10) + 1 if (N % 10) >= d else (N // 10)\n\nBut actually, from 1 to N, the number of times d appears in the units place is:\n\nIf d != 0: (N // 10) + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nWait, let me test this with N=488.\n\nFor d=4:\n\n488 // 10 =48\n\n488 %10=8 >=4, so add 1.\n\nTotal:48+1=49. Correct.\n\nFor d=8:\n\n488//10=48\n\n488%10=8 >=8, so add 1.\n\nTotal:48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place, the formula is a bit different.\n\nThe number of times d appears in the tens place is:\n\nFor each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9, so for each hundred, d appears 10 times in the tens place. Then, for the remaining part, if the tens digit is >=d, add the number of remaining numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is:\n\nNumber of times d appears in the tens place from 1 to N:\n\ncount = (N // 100) * 10\n\nremainder = N % 100\n\nif d == 0:\n    count += max(0, remainder - 10)\nelse:\n    count += min(10, remainder - (d * 10) + 1)\n\nWait, this might be getting too complicated. Alternatively, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, d appears 10 times in the tens place. Then, for the remaining numbers beyond the last complete hundred, check how many times d appears in the tens place.\n\nFor example, N=488.\n\nNumber of complete hundreds:4 (since 400 is the start of the 4th hundred).\n\nSo, for each hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.), the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, d=4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would contribute 4*10=40 times. But wait, no, from 1-488, the hundreds are 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's 5 hundreds? Wait, no, 1-99 is the first hundred, 100-199 the second, 200-299 third, 300-399 fourth, and 400-488 is part of the fifth hundred. So, 5 hundreds, but the last one is incomplete.\n\nBut for the tens place, each complete hundred contributes 10 times d in the tens place. So, for d=4, in each hundred, 10 times. So, 4 hundreds (1-399) would contribute 4*10=40 times. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0-8 (since 488 is the last). So, in 400-488, the tens digit cycles 0-8, so d=4 appears once in the tens place (440-449). So, total for tens place:40 +1=41? Wait, but earlier I thought it was 50. Hmm, now I'm confused.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let's try a different approach.\n\nFor the tens place, the number of times d appears is:\n\nFor each position, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, for each hundred, d appears 10 times in the tens place. So, from 1-488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399). Each contributes 10 times d=4 in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nNow, the remaining numbers are 400-488, which is 89 numbers. In this range, the tens digit cycles from 0-8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 400-488, the tens digit is 0 for 400-409, 1 for 410-419, ..., 8 for 480-488. So, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, in the incomplete hundred, d=4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, total tens place for d=4:40 +10=50. Which matches my earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8 in the tens place:\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nEach complete hundred contributes 10 times d=8 in the tens place. So, 4 complete hundreds:4*10=40.\n\nNow, in the incomplete hundred 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place here? It's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the incomplete hundred, d=8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, total tens place for d=8:40 +9=49. Which matches my earlier count.\n\nSo, using this method, I get the same numbers as before: 50 for 4's tens place and 49 for 8's tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for the hundreds place:\n\nFor d=4, it's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nFor d=8, there are no page numbers in the 800s, so 0 times.\n\nSo, all the counts are consistent.\n\nTherefore, total 4's:188, total 8's:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI remember that when counting digits, it's helpful to look at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. So, I'll probably need to calculate how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by calculating the number of 4's. I'll go through each place one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. For the units digit, the 4's will appear every 10 numbers. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Wait, does 484 count? Yes, because 484 is within 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, from 1 to 488, the number of times a digit appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, it's 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, does 488 include an extra 4 in the units place beyond these 48 groups? Let me see: the last group is 480-488, which includes 484, so that's another 4. So, actually, it's 48 times plus one more, making it 49. Wait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me think again. Each group of 10 has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1-9: 4 is in 4 (1 time). 10-19: 14 (1 time). 20-29: 24 (1 time). Continuing this way up to 480-488: 484 (1 time). So, how many groups of 10 are there? From 1-488, the number of groups is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups). Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the incomplete group from 480-488, we have 484, which is one more 4. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check this again. If I take 488 divided by 10, it's 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 484, which adds one more 4. So yes, 48 + 1 = 49 units place 4's.\n\nNext, the tens place. For the tens digit, 4's appear in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's one range, contributing 10 4's. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five ranges in total, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 ranges * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, no, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me add again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but wait, 49 + 50 is indeed 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed are 188.\n\nNow, let me do the same for 8's.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? From 1 to 488, each group of 10 contributes one 8. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. Then, in the incomplete group (481-488), 488 is included, which is another 8. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page. So, does 488 count as an 8 in the units place? Yes, because 488 ends with an 8. So, that's correct: 49 8's in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. 8's appear in the tens digit in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the range. So, how many such ranges are there? 80-89: 10 8's. 180-189: 10 8's. 280-289: 10 8's. 380-389: 10 8's. 480-488: 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), but only the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 8's in the tens place? Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 for all numbers from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. Each of these has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 8's. So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 10 each, so 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in tens place. Similarly for 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: each contributes 10. So, that's 4*10=40. Then, 480-488: 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, so 9. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so total 4's are 188 and total 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full groups of 10 (1-480), each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in 481-488, 484 is the only 4 in the units place, so total 49.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's five ranges, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full groups (1-480), each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, 488 is included, adding one more, so 49.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: none, since the book ends at 488. So, 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1-480, there are 48 occurrences. In 481-488, 484 adds one more, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10. There are 5 such ranges, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1-480, there are 48 occurrences. In 481-488, 488 adds one more, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributing 10. There are 4 full ranges, totaling 40. In 480-488, there are 9 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. \n\nFirst, for the units place: In the single-digit numbers, 4 appears once. Then, in the two-digit numbers, for every block of 10 pages (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So from 10 to 99, there are 9 blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so that's 9 times. But wait, from 1 to 99, that's 99 pages, so the units place cycles every 10. So from 1 to 99, the number of 4's in the units place is 9 (since 1-9 is one 4, and 10-99 adds 9 more). Wait, no, actually, from 1-9, it's one 4, and from 10-99, each ten contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 9 times, making it 10 in total for the units place up to 99? Wait, no, because from 1-9, it's one 4, and from 10-99, it's 9 more, so total of 10? Hmm, but 99 is the last two-digit number, so maybe up to 99, units place 4's are 10? Wait, no, because 10-99 is 90 numbers, so 9 blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 9 times. But including the single-digit 4, that's 10. So from 1-99, units place 4's are 10.\n\nThen, for the three-digit numbers, from 100-488, the units place 4's will occur in each hundred block. So from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Each of these blocks has 100 numbers, except the last one which is only up to 488. So in each hundred block, the units digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 pages. So in each hundred block, the number of 4's in the units place is 10 per hundred. So for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, that's 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 units place 4's, so 3*10=30. Now, for 400-488, how many units place 4's are there? Let's see, from 400-488, the units digit cycles through 0-9 for each ten. So in each ten, like 400-409, 410-419, etc., the units digit 4 appears once. How many tens are there in 400-488? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 8 full tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-489, but wait, 488 is the last page, so the last ten is 480-488, which is 9 pages. So in each of the 8 full tens, there's one 4 in the units place, so 8, and in the last partial ten, 480-488, does the units digit 4 appear? Yes, at 484. So that's one more. So total units place 4's in 400-488 is 8+1=9. So adding that to the previous 30, we get 39 units place 4's in the three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but wait, 400-488 is 89 pages, right? So from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 88 - 400 +1 = 89 pages. So in each ten, from 400-409, 410-419, etc., each ten has 10 pages, but the last one is only 9 pages (480-488). So how many full tens are there? Let's see, 400-409: 10 pages, 410-419: another 10, and so on. So from 400-480, that's 8 tens (400-409 up to 480-489, but since we stop at 488, the last ten is only up to 488). Wait, no, 400-488 is 89 pages, which is 8 full tens (each 10 pages) and a partial ten of 9 pages. So in each full ten, there's one 4 in the units place, so 8 tens give 8 units place 4's, and in the partial ten (480-488), the units digit 4 occurs at 484, so that's one more, making it 9 units place 4's in 400-488. So total units place 4's in three-digit numbers: 3 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contribute 10 units place 4's, so 3*10=30, plus 9 in 400-488, so total 39 units place 4's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 100-199: units place 4's occur at 104,114,...,194. That's 10 numbers, right? Because 104,114,...,194 is every 10 pages, so 10 numbers. Similarly for 200-299 and 300-399, each has 10 units place 4's. So 3*10=30. Then from 400-488, as we calculated, 9 units place 4's. So total units place 4's: 30+9=39.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens place, 4 can appear in the tens digit. So for single-digit numbers, there's no tens digit, so no contribution. In two-digit numbers (10-99), the tens digit is 4 for numbers 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So that's 10 tens place 4's in two-digit numbers.\n\nIn three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 4. So in 100-199, the tens digit is 4 for 140-149, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 200-299, it's 240-249, another 10. In 300-399, it's 340-349, another 10. In 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So in each hundred block, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488, each contributes 10 tens place 4's. So that's 4 blocks, each with 10, so 4*10=40 tens place 4's.\n\nWait, but wait, 400-488: the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, right? So that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So in 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all those numbers, which is 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So that's 89 hundreds place 4's.\n\nWait, let me confirm: 400-488 is 88 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So yes, 89 hundreds place 4's.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds.\n\nUnits: 39\n\nTens: 40\n\nHundreds: 89\n\nTotal 4's: 39 + 40 + 89 = 168.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 39 + 40 is 79, plus 89 is 168. So 168 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nStarting with units place. For single-digit numbers (1-9), 8 appears once.\n\nIn two-digit numbers (10-99), the units digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers, so from 10-99, that's 9 blocks of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 9 times. Including the single-digit 8, that's 10 units place 8's up to 99.\n\nIn three-digit numbers (100-488), the units digit 8 appears in each hundred block. So for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each contributes 10 units place 8's (e.g., 108,118,...,198 in 100-199). So that's 3*10=30 units place 8's in the first three hundreds. Now, in 400-488, the units digit 8 appears in each ten, so from 400-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see, 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Wait, but 488 is included, so that's 9 occurrences. Wait, from 400-488, the units digit 8 occurs at 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 times. So total units place 8's in three-digit numbers: 3*10=30 (from 100-399) plus 9 in 400-488, so 39 units place 8's.\n\nNow, tens place for 8's. In two-digit numbers, the tens digit 8 occurs from 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 tens place 8's.\n\nIn three-digit numbers, the tens digit 8 occurs in each hundred block. So in 100-199, it's 180-189, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 200-299, 280-289, another 10. In 300-399, 380-389, another 10. In 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in 400-488.\n\nSo total tens place 8's: 10 (from two-digit) + 10 (100-199) +10 (200-299) +10 (300-399) +9 (400-488) = 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nWait, let me confirm: two-digit tens place 8's: 10. Then in each three-digit hundred block, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each contributes 10 tens place 8's, so 3*10=30. Then in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 tens place 8's. So total tens place 8's: 10 + 30 +9=49.\n\nNow, hundreds place for 8's. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds place 8's. So hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 39 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=88.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 39+49=88. So 88 8's.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 168 -88=80.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me double-check the counts.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\nUnits place: 39\n\nTens place:40\n\nHundreds place:89\n\nTotal:39+40=79+89=168.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\nUnits place:39\n\nTens place:49\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal:39+49=88.\n\nDifference:168-88=80.\n\nSo, the answer is 80 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Pages 1-9: 1 occurrence (page 4).\n     - Pages 10-99: 9 occurrences (10-99, each ten contributes one 4 in the units place).\n     - Pages 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: Each contributes 10 occurrences (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194).\n     - Pages 400-488: 9 occurrences (404, 414, ..., 484).\n     - Total units place 4's: 1 + 9 + 3*10 + 9 = 39.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Pages 10-99: 10 occurrences (40-49).\n     - Pages 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488: Each contributes 10 occurrences (e.g., 140-149, 240-249).\n     - Total tens place 4's: 10 + 4*10 = 50.

    "text": " \n\nI guess I'll need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each of these ranges and do the same for the digit 8, then find the difference. Let me start by dealing with the single-digit pages. From 1 to 9, the digits are just the numbers themselves. So, the digit 4 appears once (page 4), and the digit 8 appears once (page 8). So, in the single-digit pages, the count for 4 is 1 and for 8 is also 1. The difference here is 0.\n\nNext, I'll move on to the two-digit pages, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should consider each place separately to count the occurrences of 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the tens place in two-digit numbers: the tens digit can be from 1 to 9, and the units digit can be from 0 to 9. So, for the tens place, the digit 4 will appear in the range 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, the digit 8 will appear in the range 80-89, which is also 10 numbers, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers: for each set of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 will appear once in the units place (like 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8 (like 18, 28, etc.). Since there are 9 sets of ten in the two-digit numbers (10-99), each digit will appear 9 times in the units place. So, for the units place, 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nAdding up the tens and units places for two-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times, and 8 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. So, in two-digit pages, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each, making the difference still 0.\n\nNow, onto the three-digit pages, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complicated because there are three places to consider: hundreds, tens, and units. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. \n\nLet's count how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, for the digit 8 in the hundreds place, well, since the highest hundreds digit is 4, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each hundred. So, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit can be 0-9, but for 400-488, the tens digit only goes up to 8 because 488 is the last page.\n\nSo, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.), except for the last hundred (400-488), where it's only 10 numbers (440-449). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. There are 4 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), but wait, 400-488 is only part of the fourth hundred. However, since the tens digit still cycles 0-9 in 400-488, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here as well. So, total for 4 in the tens place is 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 times.\n\nWait, but hold on. For 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so when the tens digit is 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 10 times. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred, so 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, for the digit 8 in the tens place. Similarly, in each hundred, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, etc.). However, in the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit goes up to 8, so 880-889 would be beyond 488, so actually, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 would only cover 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, no, that's not right. Because in 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8, so when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, in the last hundred, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place, whereas in the first three hundreds, it's 10 times each. So, total for 8 in the tens place is 3\u00d710 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. For 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so 3\u00d710=30. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total is 30 + 9 = 39 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. For each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens digit. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears once in the units place for each ten (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194 in 100-199). Since there are 10 tens digits (0-9) in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the units place per hundred. But wait, actually, for each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten, so for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the units place. So, with 4 hundreds, that would be 4\u00d710=40 times. But wait, in the last hundred, 400-488, the units digit goes up to 8 when the tens digit is 8. Wait, no, actually, the units digit can go up to 9 unless the number exceeds 488. So, in 400-488, when the tens digit is 8, the units digit can only go up to 8, so 488 is included. So, in the units place for 400-488, for each tens digit, the units digit can be 0-9 except when the tens digit is 8, where it can only go up to 8. So, does that affect the count for the digit 4 in the units place?\n\nWait, no. Because the digit 4 in the units place occurs when the units digit is 4, regardless of the tens digit. So, in 400-488, for each tens digit (0-8), the units digit 4 occurs once. So, that's 9 times (tens digits 0-8) plus, when the tens digit is 8, units digit 4 would be 484, which is within 488. So, actually, it's 9 times for the tens digits 0-8, and then 484 is an additional one, making it 9 + 1 = 10 times. Wait, no, because when the tens digit is 8, the units digit can go up to 8, so 484 is included. So, in 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs 9 times (for tens digits 0-8) plus one more time at 484, making it 10 times. So, actually, the digit 4 in the units place occurs 10 times in each hundred, including the last one. So, 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place. In each hundred, the digit 8 appears once in the units place for each ten. So, for each hundred, 10 times. But in the last hundred, 400-488, when the tens digit is 8, the units digit can only go up to 8, so 488 is included. So, does that affect the count? Let's see. For each hundred, the digit 8 in the units place occurs once per ten, so 10 times. In the last hundred, 400-488, when the tens digit is 8, the units digit can be 0-8, so 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So, in 400-488, the digit 8 in the units place occurs 10 times as well, because for each tens digit (0-8), the units digit 8 occurs once, and when the tens digit is 8, units digit 8 is 488, which is allowed. So, 10 times in each hundred, so 4\u00d710=40 times for 8 in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. For example, in 100-199, the units digit 8 occurs at 108, 118, ..., 198, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 200-299, it's 208, 218, ..., 298, 10 times. Same for 300-399: 308, 318, ..., 398, 10 times. Now, in 400-488, the units digit 8 occurs at 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. Wait, that's 9 times, because when the tens digit is 8, the units digit can only go up to 8, so 488 is included, making it 9 times? Wait, no, because for tens digits 0-7, units digit 8 occurs once each, that's 8 times, and then when the tens digit is 8, units digit 8 is 488, so that's 1 more, totaling 9 times. So, in 400-488, the digit 8 in the units place occurs 9 times, not 10. So, total for 8 in the units place is 3\u00d710 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 10 times, but now I'm getting 9 times. Let me check again. For 400-488, the units digit 8 occurs at 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, and 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, in the last hundred, it's 9 times. So, total for 8 in the units place is 3\u00d710 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought for 4 in the units place, it's 10 times in each hundred, including the last one. Let me confirm that. For 400-488, units digit 4 occurs at 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times, but wait, 484 is within 488, so that's 9 times. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 10 times. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me recount.\n\nIn 400-488, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, the units digit 4 occurs once. So, tens digits 0-8 are 9 digits, so 9 times. So, 404, 414, ..., 484, which is 9 numbers. So, in the last hundred, 4 in the units place occurs 9 times, not 10. So, total for 4 in the units place is 3\u00d710 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought for 4 in the units place, it was 10 times per hundred, including the last one. But now I'm seeing that in the last hundred, it's 9 times. So, that changes things. So, let me correct that.\n\nSo, for 4 in the units place:\n\n- 100-199: 10 times (104, 114, ..., 194)\n- 200-299: 10 times (204, 214, ..., 294)\n- 300-399: 10 times (304, 314, ..., 394)\n- 400-488: 9 times (404, 414, ..., 484)\n\nTotal for 4 in units place: 3\u00d710 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place:\n\n- 100-199: 10 times (108, 118, ..., 198)\n- 200-299: 10 times (208, 218, ..., 298)\n- 300-399: 10 times (308, 318, ..., 398)\n- 400-488: 9 times (408, 418, ..., 488)\n\nTotal for 8 in units place: 3\u00d710 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4 in the units place was 39 times, and 8 in the units place was 39 times. So, that's the same.\n\nNow, let me summarize the counts for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4 appears 89 times (400-488)\n  - 8 appears 0 times\n\n- Tens place:\n  - 4 appears 40 times\n  - 8 appears 39 times\n\n- Units place:\n  - 4 appears 39 times\n  - 8 appears 39 times\n\nSo, total for 4 in three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168 times.\n\nTotal for 8 in three-digit numbers: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78 times.\n\nNow, let me add up all the occurrences from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit pages.\n\nSingle-digit:\n- 4: 1\n- 8: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n- 4: 19\n- 8: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n- 4: 168\n- 8: 78\n\nTotal for 4: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nTotal for 8: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big difference.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, I had:\n\n- Hundreds place for 4: 89\n- Tens place for 4: 40\n- Units place for 4: 39\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n\nFor 8:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 39\n- Units place: 39\nTotal: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nAdding single and two-digit:\n\n- 4: 1 + 19 = 20\n- 8: 1 + 19 = 20\n\nSo, total 4's: 20 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's: 20 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the three-digit numbers, especially the units place. I think I might have made a mistake there.\n\nWait, for 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs at 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, right? Because from 400 to 488, the units digit 4 appears every 10 numbers, starting at 404, so 404, 414, ..., up to 484. That's 9 times because 484 is the 9th occurrence. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the units digit 8 in 400-488, it occurs at 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 times as well.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, 4 in units place: 39 times, 8 in units place: 39 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4 in units place was 39, which is 3\u00d710 + 9, but that's correct because in the first three hundreds, it's 10 each, and the last is 9, so 3\u00d710 +9=39.\n\nSame for 8 in units place: 3\u00d710 +9=39.\n\nSo, the counts seem correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's is 188 and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a more efficient way to calculate this? Maybe using digit positions and calculating for each position how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a formula for each digit position.\n\nFor example, in the units place, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to N can be calculated by dividing N by 10, then considering the remainder.\n\nBut maybe it's more complicated. Alternatively, I can think of each digit position separately.\n\nWait, perhaps I can confirm my earlier count by using a different approach.\n\nLet me consider each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) and calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nWell, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, total groups of 10 in 488 numbers: 48 full groups (1-480) and 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n\nIn each full group, 4 appears once, so 48\u00d71=48.\n\nIn the last partial group (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 484 is included, which is one more occurrence.\n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in units place:\n\nSame approach: 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48\u00d71=48.\n\nIn the last partial group, 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more.\n\nTotal 8's in units place: 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 39 for 4's in units place and 39 for 8's in units place. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, I think I'm mixing up the approach. When I broke it down into single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers, I considered only the page numbers, but perhaps that approach was flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to consider all numbers from 1 to 488, and count the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each digit position.\n\nSo, let's try this approach again.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in units place from 1 to 488:\n\nEach 10 numbers contribute one 4. So, total groups of 10: floor(488/10)=48 groups, each contributing one 4, so 48\u00d71=48.\n\nNow, check the remaining numbers after 480: 481-488. The units digits here are 1-8, so 484 is included, which adds one more 4. So, total 4's in units place: 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, number of times 8 appears in units place:\n\nEach 10 numbers contribute one 8, so 48\u00d71=48.\n\nIn the remaining numbers 481-488, 488 is included, which has an 8 in units place, so one more. Total 8's in units place: 48 +1=49.\n\nNow, tens place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in tens place from 1 to 488:\n\nEach hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n\nBut since we're going up to 488, let's see:\n\nFrom 1-488, the tens digit cycles 0-9 every 100 numbers.\n\nSo, in 1-99: 40-49, which is 10 numbers.\n\nIn 100-199: 140-149, another 10.\n\nIn 200-299: 240-249, another 10.\n\nIn 300-399: 340-349, another 10.\n\nIn 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers.\n\nSo, total for 4 in tens place: 5 sets \u00d710=50.\n\nWait, but wait, 1-99: 40-49 (10)\n100-199: 140-149 (10)\n200-299: 240-249 (10)\n300-399: 340-349 (10)\n400-488: 440-449 (10)\nTotal: 5\u00d710=50.\n\nSimilarly, number of times 8 appears in tens place:\n\nIn each hundred:\n\n1-99: 80-89 (10)\n100-199: 180-189 (10)\n200-299: 280-289 (10)\n300-399: 380-389 (10)\n400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page.\n\nSo, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total for 8 in tens place: 4\u00d710 (from 1-399) +9=49.\n\nWait, but in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times, so total 4\u00d710 +9=49.\n\nSo, 4 in tens place:50, 8 in tens place:49.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in hundreds place:\n\nFrom 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89 numbers.\n\nSo, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNumber of times 8 appears in hundreds place:\n\nSince the book goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up:\n\nUnits place:\n- 4:49\n- 8:49\n\nTens place:\n- 4:50\n- 8:49\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4:89\n- 8:0\n\nTotal for 4:49+50+89=188\nTotal for 8:49+49+0=98\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier when I broke it down into single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit, I got the same result. So, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately, we find that the digit 4 appears 188 times and the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the first thing I should do is figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in each of these sections and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are. That makes sense.\n\nLet me start by looking at the single-digit pages, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears exactly once, on page 4. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once, on page 8. So, in the single-digit pages, both 4 and 8 appear once each. That means, so far, the count for 4 and 8 is equal. \n\nNext, I need to consider the two-digit pages, which go from 10 to 99. Two-digit numbers have a tens place and a units place. I think I should calculate how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place, then add them together for the total number of 4's. The same approach will apply to the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4 in the two-digit numbers. For the tens place, the numbers would be from 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For the units place, 4 can appear in numbers like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but since we're only going up to 99, let's see: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, right? Because 44 has two 4's, but I think each occurrence counts separately. So, in the units place, 4 appears 9 times. Therefore, the total number of 4's in two-digit pages is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times.\n\nWait, no, let me check that again. When considering the units place, from 10 to 99, how many numbers end with 4? It's every 10 numbers, so 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times. So yes, 10 in the tens place and 9 in the units place, totaling 19.\n\nNow, for the digit 8 in the two-digit numbers. In the tens place, 8 appears from 80 to 89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. In the units place, 8 appears in 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times. Therefore, total 8's in two-digit pages are 10 + 9 = 19 times.\n\nWait, that's the same as 4's. So, in two-digit pages, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each. So, so far, the count is 4's: 1 (single-digit) + 19 = 20, and 8's: 1 + 19 = 20. So, they're equal so far.\n\nNow, moving on to the three-digit pages, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because now each page number has hundreds, tens, and units places. I need to calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each of these places.\n\nLet's start with the digit 4. I'll break it down by hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The three-digit numbers go from 100 to 488. So, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place. For the tens place, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens digit across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488. Let's think about this.\n\nIn the hundreds place, it can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. For each hundreds digit, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 100 numbers. So, for each hundreds digit (1,2,3,4), the digit 4 appears in the tens place exactly 10 times per hundred. But wait, for the hundreds digit 4, we only go up to 488, so the tens digit can only go up to 8. So, I need to adjust for that.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to consider each hundreds group separately.\n\n- For hundreds digit 1: pages 100-199. In the tens place, 4 appears in 140-149, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times.\n- For hundreds digit 2: pages 200-299. Similarly, 240-249: 10 times.\n- For hundreds digit 3: pages 300-399. 340-349: 10 times.\n- For hundreds digit 4: pages 400-488. Here, the tens digit can go up to 8, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 488 is the last page, so after 449, the next set would be 450-459, etc., but since we're only considering the tens digit, 4 in the tens place occurs once every 100 numbers. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n\nWait, but 488 is less than 499, so does that affect the count? No, because 440-449 is entirely within 400-488, so it's 10 numbers. So, total for the tens place in 4's is 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 times.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because in the hundreds digit 4, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, so when considering 440-449, that's correct, but perhaps I should check if 440-449 is within 400-488. Yes, it is, so 10 times.\n\nNow, for the units place in three-digit numbers. How many times does 4 appear in the units place from 100 to 488?\n\nAgain, let's break it down by hundreds.\n\n- For hundreds digit 1: pages 100-199. The units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the units place 10 times (104,114,...,194). So, 10 times.\n- Similarly, for hundreds digit 2: 200-299: 204,214,...,294: 10 times.\n- Hundreds digit 3: 300-399: 304,314,...,394: 10 times.\n- Hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Now, here, the units digit 4 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers end with 4?\n\nLet's see: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Wait, 484 is within 488, so that's 9 numbers. Because 400 + 4 is 404, then 414, etc., up to 484. So, that's 9 times.\n\nWait, but wait: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 404 is the first and 484 is the last, with a difference of 80 between 404 and 484, so (484-404)/10 +1 = 9 numbers. So, 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total units place 4's in three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place 89 + tens place 40 + units place 39 = 89+40=129+39=168 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Hundreds place: 89, tens place: 40, units place: 39. So, 89+40=129, 129+39=168. So, 4's appear 168 times in three-digit pages.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place in three-digit numbers. The hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, how many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would be where 8 is in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times.\n\nNext, the tens place for 8 in three-digit numbers.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: pages 100-199. The tens digit 8 appears in 180-189: 10 numbers.\n- Hundreds digit 2: 200-299: 280-289: 10 numbers.\n- Hundreds digit 3: 300-399: 380-389: 10 numbers.\n- Hundreds digit 4: 400-488. The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nNow, the units place for 8 in three-digit numbers.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 100-199. Units digit 8 appears in 108,118,128,...,198. That's 10 numbers.\n- Hundreds digit 2: 208,218,...,298: 10 numbers.\n- Hundreds digit 3: 308,318,...,398: 10 numbers.\n- Hundreds digit 4: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Wait, let's count these. From 400-488, how many numbers end with 8?\n\nStarting at 408, then 418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 408 is the first and 488 is the last, with a difference of 80, so (488-408)/10 +1 = 9 numbers.\n\nSo, units place 8's: 10 +10 +10 +9 = 39 times.\n\nTherefore, total 8's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place 0 + tens place 39 + units place 39 = 78 times.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 0 + 39 +39=78.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's and 8's across all page numbers.\n\nTotal 4's:\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit:168\nTotal:1+19=20+168=188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit:78\nTotal:1+19=20+78=98.\n\nWait, so total 4's are 188 and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1 (correct)\nTwo-digit:19 (correct)\nThree-digit: hundreds=89, tens=40, units=39. 89+40=129+39=168. So, total 4's:1+19+168=188.\n\n8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1 (correct)\nTwo-digit:19 (correct)\nThree-digit: hundreds=0, tens=39, units=39. 0+39+39=78. So, total 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the three-digit counts, because that's where most of the numbers are.\n\nFor 4's in three-digit:\n\nHundreds place: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). Correct.\n\nTens place: For each hundreds group (1,2,3,4), 10 times each, but in the 400-488 group, the tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10*4=40. Correct.\n\nUnits place: For hundreds 1,2,3: 10 each, so 30. For 400-488: 404,414,...,484: that's 9 numbers. So, 30+9=39. Correct.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in three-digit:\n\nHundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nTens place: For hundreds 1,2,3: 10 each, so 30. For 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 30+9=39. Correct.\n\nUnits place: For hundreds 1,2,3: 10 each, so 30. For 400-488: 408,418,...,488: 9 numbers. So, 30+9=39. Correct.\n\nSo, 0+39+39=78. Correct.\n\nThus, total 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:90.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when I was counting the units place for 4 in three-digit numbers, I had 10 for each of 1,2,3, and 9 for 4, totaling 39. Similarly for 8, same approach.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, for the units place. In the single-digit numbers, only page 4 has a 4 in the units place. That's one occurrence. Now, for the two-digit numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, from 10 to 99, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 9 times in the units place (since 10-99 is 90 numbers, 90/10=9). So, the digit 4 appears 9 times in the units place for two-digit numbers. Similarly, for the three-digit numbers, from 100 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. Let me see, from 100 to 488, how many sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 - 100 + 1 = 389 pages, so 389 / 10 = 38 full sets, and then 9 extra pages (481 to 488). In each full set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So that's 38 times. Now, in the extra 9 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so no additional 4's there. So, total units place 4's in three-digit numbers: 38.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Because when considering the three-digit numbers, from 100 to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But when looking at the units digit, I think the calculation is correct because regardless of the hundreds digit, the units digit cycles every 10. So, from 100 to 488, how many complete decades are there? Let me check: 488 - 100 + 1 = 389. So, 389 divided by 10 is 38.9, meaning 38 full decades and a partial one. Each full decade contributes one 4 in the units place, so 38 times. Then, in the partial decade (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so no 4's. So, total units place 4's: 38.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For single-digit numbers, there's no tens digit, so no 4's there. For two-digit numbers, the tens digit is 4 for the range 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. For three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 4 in two scenarios: when the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each of these hundreds groups, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). \n\nLet me calculate how many times 4 appears in the tens place for three-digit numbers. For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, each contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So that's 3 * 10 = 30. Now, for the hundreds digit 4, the range is 400-488. The tens digit here can be 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's in three-digit numbers: 30 + 10 = 40.\n\nWait, but wait a second. From 400-488, the tens digit can go up to 8, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct, 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 40.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's. Units place: 1 (single-digit) + 9 (two-digit) + 38 (three-digit) = 48. Tens place: 10 (two-digit) + 40 (three-digit) = 50. Hundreds place: 89. So total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units place: single-digit (1) + two-digit (9) + three-digit (38) = 48. Tens place: two-digit (10) + three-digit (40) = 50. Hundreds place: 89. So total 4's: 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. Hmm, that seems high. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the units place for three-digit numbers. From 100 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Each full set of 10 pages contributes one 4 in the units place. So, from 100 to 488, how many full decades are there? 488 - 100 = 388, so 388 / 10 = 38.8, which means 38 full decades. So, 38 times 4 in the units place. Then, the last partial decade is 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so no additional 4's. So, units place in three-digit numbers: 38. So, units total: 1 (single) + 9 (two-digit) + 38 (three-digit) = 48. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: two-digit numbers have 40-49, which is 10 times. For three-digit numbers, each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributes 10 times where the tens digit is 4, so 3 * 10 = 30. Then, 400-488: the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 30 + 10 = 40. So, tens place total: 10 (two-digit) + 40 (three-digit) = 50.\n\nHundreds place: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nAdding up: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with units place. Single-digit numbers: only page 8, so one occurrence. Two-digit numbers: from 10-99, each digit 0-9 appears 9 times in the units place, so 9 occurrences of 8. Three-digit numbers: from 100-488, each full decade contributes one 8 in the units place. How many full decades are there? 488 - 100 = 388, so 38 full decades, each contributing one 8, so 38. Then, the last partial decade is 481-488, which has units digits 1-8, so 8 appears once more at 488. So, units place in three-digit numbers: 38 + 1 = 39. So, total units place 8's: 1 (single) + 9 (two-digit) + 39 (three-digit) = 49.\n\nNext, tens place. Single-digit numbers: no tens digit, so zero. Two-digit numbers: the tens digit is 8 for 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. Three-digit numbers: for each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers each (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, etc.), so 3 * 10 = 30. Now, for the hundreds group 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, that's 9 occurrences. So, total tens place 8's in three-digit numbers: 30 + 9 = 39. So, total tens place 8's: 10 (two-digit) + 39 (three-digit) = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 1 (single) + 9 (two-digit) + 39 (three-digit) = 49. Tens place: 10 (two-digit) + 39 (three-digit) = 49. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, total 4's are 187, and total 8's are 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when counting, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through the 8's count again.\n\nUnits place for 8: single-digit (8) is 1. Two-digit: 10-99, each digit 0-9 appears 9 times in units, so 9. Three-digit: from 100-488, how many times does 8 appear in units? Each full decade (100-109, 110-119, etc.) contributes one 8 in units. From 100-488, that's 388 numbers, which is 38 full decades (100-109 is the first, up to 480-489, but since we stop at 488, the last decade is 480-488, which is 9 numbers). So, 38 full decades, each contributing one 8, so 38. Then, in the last partial decade (480-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8. So, 38 + 1 = 39. So, units place 8's: 1 + 9 + 39 = 49.\n\nTens place for 8: two-digit numbers (80-89) is 10. Three-digit numbers: each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8 (180-189, etc.), so 3 * 10 = 30. For 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 30 + 9 = 39. So, tens place 8's: 10 + 39 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's, I had 187. So, 187 - 98 = 89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. When I counted the units place for 4's in three-digit numbers, I considered 38 full decades, each contributing one 4, and the last partial decade (481-488) didn't add any. That seems correct because 481-488 ends at 8, so no 4 in units. Similarly, for 8's, the last partial decade did add one more because 488 is included.\n\nWait, but let me check the three-digit units place for 4's again. From 100 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Each full decade (100-109, 110-119, etc.) has one 4 in units. So, 488 - 100 = 388, which is 38 full decades. So, 38 times. Then, the last partial decade is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but since 488 is the last page, the units digits go from 0 to 8, so 480-488 includes 484, which is a 4 in units. Wait, wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, in this partial decade, the units digit is 4 at 484. So, that's one more occurrence. So, units place 4's in three-digit numbers should be 38 + 1 = 39, not 38. Oh no, I think I made a mistake here earlier.\n\nSo, going back, units place 4's: single-digit (1), two-digit (9), three-digit (39). So, 1 + 9 + 39 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, tens place 4's: two-digit (10), three-digit: each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributes 10 each, so 3 * 10 = 30. Then, 400-488: tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 30 + 10 = 40. So, tens place 4's: 10 + 40 = 50.\n\nHundreds place 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nWait, that's different from before. So, I had initially counted 38 for three-digit units place 4's, but actually, it's 39 because in the last partial decade (480-488), 484 is included. So, units place 4's in three-digit numbers: 38 + 1 = 39. So, total 4's: 1 + 9 + 39 = 49 in units, 10 + 40 = 50 in tens, and 89 in hundreds. So, 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the last partial decade didn't add any, but now I see that 484 is included, so that's an extra 4 in units place. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, units place: 1 (single) + 9 (two-digit) + 39 (three-digit) = 49. Tens place: 10 (two-digit) + 39 (three-digit) = 49. So, total 8's: 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 187 - 98 = 89, but now it's 188 - 98 = 90. So, I think I made a mistake in the initial count of units place 4's in three-digit numbers. So, the correct total 4's should be 188, and 8's are 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, let me go through this again carefully.\n\nUnits place 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 4 \u2192 1 occurrence.\n\n- Two-digit: 10-99. Each set of 10 numbers has one 4 in units place. There are 9 sets (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), so 9 occurrences.\n\n- Three-digit: 100-488.\n\n  - Each full decade (100-109, 110-119, ..., 470-479) contributes one 4 in units. How many full decades are there?\n\n  - 488 - 100 = 388. 388 / 10 = 38.8, so 38 full decades. So, 38 occurrences.\n\n  - The last partial decade is 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488.\n\n  - In this partial decade, the units digits are 0-8. So, 484 has a 4 in units place. So, that's one more occurrence.\n\n  - So, three-digit units place 4's: 38 + 1 = 39.\n\nTotal units place 4's: 1 + 9 + 39 = 49.\n\nTens place 4's:\n\n- Two-digit: 40-49 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n\n- Three-digit:\n\n  - For each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). So, 3 * 10 = 30.\n\n  - For 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n\n  - So, total tens place 4's in three-digit: 30 + 10 = 40.\n\nTotal tens place 4's: 10 + 40 = 50.\n\nHundreds place 4's:\n\n- From 400-488: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n\nTotal hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\nUnits place 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 8 \u2192 1.\n\n- Two-digit: 10-99. Each set of 10 has one 8 in units. 9 sets, so 9.\n\n- Three-digit: 100-488.\n\n  - Each full decade contributes one 8 in units. 38 full decades, so 38.\n\n  - The last partial decade: 480-488. Units digits 0-8, so 488 is included, which is another 8 in units.\n\n  - So, 38 + 1 = 39.\n\nTotal units place 8's: 1 + 9 + 39 = 49.\n\nTens place 8's:\n\n- Two-digit: 80-89 \u2192 10.\n\n- Three-digit:\n\n  - Each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributes 10 numbers where tens digit is 8. So, 3 * 10 = 30.\n\n  - For 400-488, tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\n  - So, total tens place 8's in three-digit: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nTotal tens place 8's: 10 + 39 = 49.\n\nHundreds place 8's: 0, since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 89, but after correcting the units place count, it's 90. So, the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't make any other mistakes. Let me recount the units place for 4's in three-digit numbers. From 100 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEach full decade (10 numbers) contributes one 4. So, 38 full decades give 38. Then, in the last partial decade (480-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included, which is another 4. So, 38 + 1 = 39. So, yes, units place 4's in three-digit numbers: 39.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: 38 full decades give 38, and the last partial decade includes 488, so 38 + 1 = 39. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. Difference: 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the three-digit tens place for 4's again. For each hundreds group (100-199, etc.), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, 3 groups, 10 each, so 30. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 30 + 10 = 40. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place: three-digit numbers have 3 * 10 = 30, plus 9 in 400-488, so 39. So, correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 89, correct.\n\nSo, I think the correct difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding how many more 4's are printed than 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Single-digit pages (1-9): 1 occurrence (page 4).\n     - Two-digit pages (10-99): Each set of 10 pages contributes one '4' in the units place, so 9 occurrences.\n     - Three-digit pages (100-488): Each full decade (e.g., 100-109) contributes one '4'.

Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the difference. \n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each place for both 4 and 8, then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's.\n\n1. **Units place for 4:**\n   - From 1 to 488, every set of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484). \n   - To find how many such sets there are, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full sets (since 48*10=480) and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). \n   - Each full set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. \n   - Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, 484 is within this range, which adds another 4. \n   - So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place for 4:**\n   - The tens digit is 4 for numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. \n   - Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n   - Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. \n   - Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50.\n   - But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, it's valid. So, 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place for 4:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. \n   - How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. \n   - So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times.\n\nNow, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours.\n\nNext, let's count the number of 8's.\n\n1. **Units place for 8:**\n   - Similar to 4's, every set of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place (like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488).\n   - 488 divided by 10 is 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's another 1.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place for 8:**\n   - The tens digit is 8 for numbers from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.\n   - Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this range.\n   - Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - That's 4 ranges, so 4*10=40.\n   - Now, the last range is 480-488. How many numbers here? From 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 for all these 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place.\n   - So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place for 8:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n   - So, 0 occurrences.\n\nNow, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check the tens place for 8. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40 plus 9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems right because 488 - 400 +1 =89.\n\nWait, let me check the tens place for 4. I had 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges, 5*10=50. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, units place for 4: 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus 484, so 49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 8: 48 full sets, plus 488, so 49. Correct.\n\nTens place for 8: 4 ranges of 10, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\nTo find this, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (48 from 1-480 and 1 from 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (10 each from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (48 from 1-480 and 1 from 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (10 each from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 9 from 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, then subtract the two to find the difference. Let me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's. \n\nStarting with the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, it's 4; from 11-20, it's 14; and so on. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and an extra 8 pages. Each complete set contributes 1 four in the units place, so that's 48 fours. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So total fours in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Here, the digit 4 appears in a block of ten numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all ten numbers. Similarly, this happens every hundred numbers. So, from 1-99, it's 40-49, which is 10 fours. From 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10 fours. From 200-299, it's 240-249, another 10 fours. From 300-399, it's 340-349, another 10 fours. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is another 10 fours. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so after 449, the next would be 540-549, which is beyond 488. So, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? Let's count the blocks: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but wait, from 400-488, 440-449 is within that range, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, contributing 89 fours.\n\nSo, total fours in all positions: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to fours, in every set of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing 1 eight, so 48 eights. Then, the extra 8 pages (481-488) include 488, which has an 8 in the units place, so that's 1 more. So total eights in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in blocks of ten numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, how many such blocks are there?\n\nFrom 1-99: 80-89 (10 eights)\nFrom 100-199: 180-189 (10 eights)\nFrom 200-299: 280-289 (10 eights)\nFrom 300-399: 380-389 (10 eights)\nFrom 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 for all these 9 numbers, so 9 eights.\n\nSo total eights in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, 10+10+10+10=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the hundreds place with 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 480-488. The tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, right? So from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So that's correct, 9 eights there.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but when I calculated fours, I had 188 fours, and eights are 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, for fours:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 98.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90 more fours.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for fours again. I said from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 blocks, each with 10 fours, so 50. That seems right.\n\nFor eights in the tens place, I had 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial block of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10=40 plus 9=49. Correct.\n\nUnits place: For both fours and eights, it's 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing 1 digit, and then an extra 8 pages where the digit appears once more. So, 48+1=49 for both. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: For fours, it's 89 numbers from 400-488, so 89 fours. For eights, since 800-899 is beyond 488, so 0.\n\nSo, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when counting the hundreds place for fours, from 400-488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: total number of page numbers is 488. The number of digits used can be calculated, but maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps I can think about how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula for each digit position.\n\nFor units place: The number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is floor((N + 1) / 10) + extra if the units digit is >= d.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to calculate for each digit position separately.\n\nBut I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nWait, another check: For eights in the tens place, I had 480-488 contributing 9 eights. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, 9 eights. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nFours are 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the approach here is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each of these sections and do the same for the digit 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense. Let me start by counting the number of 4's and 8's in each section separately.\n\nFirst, let's handle the single-digit pages, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits that appear are just 1 through 9. So, the digit 4 appears once, which is on page 4. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once on page 8. So, in single-digit pages, there's one 4 and one 8.\n\nNext, I need to look at the two-digit pages, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should count the number of 4's and 8's in each of these places separately.\n\nStarting with the tens place: For the tens digit, 4 appears from page 40 to 49. That's 10 pages, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, the digit 8 appears from page 80 to 89, which is another 10 pages, so 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers: The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers, right? So, from 10 to 99, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, it's 10 times because every ten numbers (like 14, 24, 34, ..., 94) have a 4 in the units place. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers, so from 18, 28, 38, ..., 98, that's 9 times. Wait, wait, hold on. From 10 to 99, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each ten. So, starting at 10, the first units digit is 0, then 1, up to 9. So, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is 9? Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. From 10 to 99, how many numbers end with 8? It's 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times. But wait, 88 is included here, but we've already counted 8 in the tens place for 80-89. So, in the units place, it's 9 times. Similarly, for 4, it's 10 times because from 14, 24, ..., 94, that's 9 numbers, but wait, 14 is in 10-19, 24 in 20-29, and so on up to 94 in 90-99. Wait, that's 9 numbers, so 9 times? Hmm, I'm getting confused here. Let me list them out. For 4 in the units place: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times. Similarly, for 8 in the units place: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's also 9 numbers, so 9 times. Wait, but earlier I thought 4 appears 10 times in the units place. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, in the units place for two-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear 9 times each. Therefore, for two-digit pages, the number of 4's in the units place is 9, and in the tens place, it's 10, so total 4's in two-digit numbers are 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. Similarly, for 8's, it's 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. Wait, so in two-digit pages, both 4's and 8's appear 19 times each? That seems correct because each digit appears 10 times in the tens place and 9 times in the units place, adding up to 19 each.\n\nNow, moving on to the three-digit pages, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because each page number has hundreds, tens, and units places. I need to count the number of 4's and 8's in each of these places.\n\nLet me start by considering the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, since the book goes up to 488. So, from 100 to 399, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3, and from 400 to 488, it's 4.\n\nFirst, for the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the highest hundreds digit is 4, so 8 doesn't appear here.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers: I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place from 100 to 488.\n\nLet me break this down by each hundred. So, from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each ten. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.), and similarly for 8, it's 10 numbers (180-189, 280-289, etc.).\n\nBut wait, for the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, but the units digit goes up to 8 only in the case of 480-488. Hmm, maybe I should handle each hundred separately.\n\nFirst, 100-199: Tens digit cycles 0-9, so 4 appears 10 times (140-149), and 8 appears 10 times (180-189).\n\nSimilarly, 200-299: Tens digit 4 appears 10 times (240-249), and 8 appears 10 times (280-289).\n\n300-399: Same pattern, 4 appears 10 times (340-349), and 8 appears 10 times (380-389).\n\nNow, 400-488: The tens digit can go from 0 to 8, but since the hundreds digit is 4, we need to consider how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nFor the digit 4 in the tens place: It would be 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the tens place: It would be 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n\nSo, adding up across all hundreds:\n\nFor the digit 4 in the tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 times.\n\nWait, but in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 10 times. So total 4's in the tens place across all three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, that's 39 times. So, 8 appears 39 times in the tens place in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, I'll consider each hundred separately.\n\nStarting with 100-199: The units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, for each ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for 8.\n\nSimilarly, for each hundred, the units digit 4 appears 10 times (once per ten), same for 8.\n\nWait, no, actually, for each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the units place (e.g., 104,114,124,...,194), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (108,118,128,...,198).\n\nBut wait, in the last hundred, 400-488, the units digit goes up to 8, but since the hundreds digit is 4, we need to check if 488 is included. So, let's handle each hundred:\n\n100-199: Units digit 4 appears 10 times (104,114,...,194), and 8 appears 10 times (108,118,...,198).\n\n200-299: Similarly, 4 appears 10 times (204,214,...,294), and 8 appears 10 times (208,218,...,298).\n\n300-399: Same pattern, 4 appears 10 times (304,314,...,394), and 8 appears 10 times (308,318,...,398).\n\n400-488: Now, the units digit 4 appears in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 times because 484 is within 488, but 494 would be beyond 488. Wait, no, 484 is the last one because 484 +10 is 494, which is beyond 488. So, from 400-488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? Let's see: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place in 400-488: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, adding up across all hundreds:\n\nFor digit 4 in the units place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nFor digit 8 in the units place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 400-488, the units digit 4 appears 9 times, as we listed. So, total for 4's in units place: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me confirm with an example. In 100-199, units digit 4 appears in 104,114,...,194, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 8 appears in 108,118,...,198, which is 10 numbers. So yes, that's correct. So, for each hundred, it's 10 times for both 4 and 8 in the units place, except for the last hundred, 400-488, where it's 9 times each.\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n- Units place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's and 8's across all sections.\n\nStarting with single-digit pages:\n\n- 4's: 1\n- 8's: 1\n\nTwo-digit pages:\n\n- 4's: 19\n- 8's: 19\n\nThree-digit pages:\n\n- 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n- 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again. For three-digit pages, hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. Tens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times. Units place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit pages: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nTotal 8's in three-digit pages: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nNow, adding up all sections:\n\nTotal 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) = 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 = 90, which seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the three-digit pages, I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, which is correct. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the tens place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-199: 10 times 4, 10 times 8\n- 200-299: 10 times 4, 10 times 8\n- 300-399: 10 times 4, 10 times 8\n- 400-488: 10 times 4, 9 times 8\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 10+10+10+10=40\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 10+10+10+9=39\n\nSimilarly, for units place:\n\n- 100-199: 10 times 4, 10 times 8\n- 200-299: 10 times 4, 10 times 8\n- 300-399: 10 times 4, 10 times 8\n- 400-488: 9 times 4, 9 times 8\n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 10+10+10+9=39\n\nTotal 8's in units place: 10+10+10+9=39\n\nSo, that part seems correct.\n\nNow, total 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\nTotal 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a lot. Let me check if I didn't overcount somewhere.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, the hundreds place for 4 is 89, which is correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's, it's 40 times, which is 10 per hundred for four hundreds, but wait, 400-488 is only part of a hundred, so actually, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399 each have 10 4's in the tens place, and 400-488 has 10 4's in the tens place (440-449). So that's 4 times 10, which is 40. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399 each have 10 8's, and 400-488 has 9 8's in the tens place (480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSame for units place: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399 each have 10 4's and 10 8's in the units place, and 400-488 has 9 4's and 9 8's. So, 10+10+10+9=39 for both 4's and 8's in units place.\n\nSo, adding up, three-digit 4's: 89+40+39=168\n\nThree-digit 8's: 0+39+39=78\n\nThen, single and two-digit:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 each\n\nTwo-digit: 19 each\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each of these ranges and do the same for the digit 8, then subtract the two totals to find the difference. Let's start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the single-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears once (page 4), and the digit 8 appears once (page 8). So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear once each in the single-digit pages.\n\nNow, moving on to the two-digit numbers, which range from 10 to 99. In the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 9 times (since there are 9 decades: 10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99). So, the digit 4 appears 9 times in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears 9 times. \n\nIn the tens place for two-digit numbers, each digit from 1 to 9 appears 10 times. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (pages 40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (pages 80-89). \n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, in the units place, 4 and 8 each have 9 occurrences, and in the tens place, each has 10 occurrences. So total for two-digit numbers: 4 has 9 + 10 = 19 times, and 8 has 9 + 10 = 19 times as well.\n\nWait, but hold on, the two-digit numbers go up to 99, and our book goes up to 488, so we also have three-digit numbers. Let's now consider the three-digit numbers, which are from 100 to 488.\n\nIn the three-digit numbers, we have hundreds, tens, and units places. Let's break it down:\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, but not beyond.\n\nFor the digit 4 in the hundreds place: It appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the hundreds place: Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit can't be 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nNow, the tens place in three-digit numbers. Let's consider how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nIn the three-digit range, the tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So, from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nIn each hundred block, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each ten pages. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.), and similarly for 8.\n\nBut since the last block is only up to 488, we have to check if the tens digit goes up to 8 in that block.\n\nLet's calculate for each hundred:\n\n1. 100-199: The tens digit cycles 0-9, so 4 appears 10 times (140-149), 8 appears 10 times (180-189).\n2. 200-299: Similarly, 4 appears 10 times (240-249), 8 appears 10 times (280-289).\n3. 300-399: 4 appears 10 times (340-349), 8 appears 10 times (380-389).\n4. 400-488: Here, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 10 times (480-488). Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 pages (480,481,...,488), so actually, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place for this block.\n\nWait, no, let me correct that. The tens digit in 400-488 is 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place for this block. Similarly, the digit 4 in the tens place for 400-488 would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times for 4 and 9 times for 8 in the tens place for the 400-488 block.\n\nSo, adding up across all hundreds:\n\n- For 4 in the tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 times.\n- For 8 in the tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. Similarly, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in the units place for each hundred block, except possibly the last block if it's cut short.\n\nSo, in each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the units digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the units place, and the digit 8 appears 10 times.\n\nFor the last block, 400-488, the units digit goes from 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in the units place, how many times does 4 and 8 appear?\n\nIn 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens digit. But since the last number is 488, the units digit for the tens digit 8 only goes up to 8. So, for units digit 4, it appears once in each ten (e.g., 404, 414, ..., 484). There are 9 tens digits (0-8), so 9 times. Similarly, for units digit 8, it appears once in each ten (e.g., 408, 418, ..., 488). There are 9 tens digits, but the last one is 488, so 9 times as well.\n\nWait, but actually, in 400-488, each units digit from 0-9 appears the same number of times except for the last digit if the range isn't a full hundred. Wait, no, because 400-488 is 89 numbers. Let me think differently.\n\nIn the units place, for each hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times. But in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, how does that affect?\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to calculate how many times each digit appears in the units place across all three-digit numbers.\n\nFor each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each digit 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the units place. So, for each of these blocks, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the units place.\n\nNow, for the 400-488 block, which is 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, how many times does each digit appear in the units place?\n\nIn the 400-488 range, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens digit, but since the last tens digit is 8 (as 488 is the last page), the units digits go up to 8 for the tens digit 8.\n\nSo, for units digits:\n\n- For tens digits 0-7: each units digit 0-9 appears once, so 8 times 10 digits = 80 numbers, but wait, that's not quite right. Wait, no, each tens digit from 0-8 (since 400-488 is 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 8 tens digits (0-8) with 10 units each except the last one, which is only 9 units (0-8). Wait, no, 400-488 is 89 numbers. Let me see:\n\nFrom 400 to 488, the number of numbers is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nIn terms of units digits, for each tens digit from 0 to 8:\n\n- Tens digits 0-7: Each has 10 units digits (0-9), so 8 tens digits \u00d7 10 units = 80 numbers.\n- Tens digit 8: Units digits 0-8, so 9 numbers.\n\nSo, in total, 80 + 9 = 89 numbers, which checks out.\n\nNow, for units digits:\n\n- For tens digits 0-7: Each digit 0-9 appears once per tens digit. So, for each of these 8 tens digits, digit 4 appears once, so 8 times. Similarly, digit 8 appears 8 times.\n- For tens digit 8: Units digits 0-8, so digit 4 appears once (484) and digit 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo, in the 400-488 block, digit 4 appears 8 (from tens 0-7) + 1 (from tens 8) = 9 times in the units place. Similarly, digit 8 appears 8 (from tens 0-7) + 1 (from tens 8) = 9 times in the units place.\n\nTherefore, across all three-digit numbers:\n\n- Units place for 4: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n- Units place for 8: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 39 times in the three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Each of the first three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributes 10 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place, so that's 3\u00d710=30 each. Then, the 400-488 block contributes 9 each, so total 39 each. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's sum up all occurrences:\n\nFirst, single-digit numbers:\n\n- 4: 1 (units place)\n- 8: 1 (units place)\n\nTwo-digit numbers:\n\n- 4: 19 (units:9 + tens:10)\n- 8: 19 (units:9 + tens:10)\n\nThree-digit numbers:\n\n- 4: hundreds place:89, tens place:40, units place:39. Wait, wait, no, I think I might have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, earlier when I was considering three-digit numbers, I considered hundreds, tens, and units separately. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488). 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears 40 times (10 each in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 10 in 400-488, but wait, earlier I thought it was 10 in 400-488, but actually, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 10 times. So, 10\u00d74=40 for 4 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place: 10 in each of the first three hundreds, and 9 in the last hundred (400-488), so 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nIn the units place, as calculated, 39 each for 4 and 8.\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4: hundreds (89) + tens (40) + units (39) = 89+40+39 = 168\n- 8: hundreds (0) + tens (39) + units (39) = 0+39+39 = 78\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because earlier I thought in the units place, both 4 and 8 have 39 each, but in the hundreds place, 4 has 89 and 8 has 0.\n\nWait, let me recast this:\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me think again.\n\nIn the hundreds place, for three-digit numbers (100-488):\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 100-199, which is 100 numbers. So, digit 1 appears 100 times in the hundreds place.\n- Hundreds digit 2: 200-299, 100 numbers, digit 2 appears 100 times.\n- Hundreds digit 3: 300-399, 100 numbers, digit 3 appears 100 times.\n- Hundreds digit 4: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 never appears because there's no 800-899 block.\n\nIn the tens place, for three-digit numbers:\n\n- For each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles 0-9 for each ten numbers.\n\nSo, for each hundred block except the last one, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 and 8, each appears 10 times per hundred block.\n\nBut in the last block, 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so for the tens digit 8, there are only 9 numbers (480-488). So, in the tens place:\n\n- For 4: in each of the first three hundreds, 10 times, and in 400-488, 10 times (440-449). So, 10\u00d74=40 times.\n- For 8: in each of the first three hundreds, 10 times, and in 400-488, 9 times (480-488). So, 10\u00d73 +9=39 times.\n\nIn the units place:\n\n- For each hundred block, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the units place. So, for the first three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each digit appears 3\u00d710=30 times in the units place.\n- In the last block, 400-488, each digit 0-9 appears 9 times because there are only 89 numbers. Wait, no, that's not quite accurate.\n\nWait, in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9 for each tens digit, but the last tens digit (8) only goes up to 8. So, for each tens digit from 0-7, the units digit cycles 0-9, which is 8 tens digits \u00d710 units =80 numbers. Then, for tens digit 8, units digits go from 0-8, which is 9 numbers. So, total 89.\n\nTherefore, for units digits in 400-488:\n\n- Each digit from 0-9 appears 8 times in the tens digits 0-7, and 1 time in the tens digit 8 if the digit is \u22648.\n\nSo, for digit 4 in units place:\n\n- In tens digits 0-7: appears 8 times (404,414,...,474)\n- In tens digit 8: appears once (484)\n- Total: 8+1=9 times\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in units place:\n\n- In tens digits 0-7: appears 8 times (408,418,...,478)\n- In tens digit 8: appears once (488)\n- Total: 8+1=9 times\n\nTherefore, across all three-digit numbers:\n\n- Units place for 4: 3\u00d710 (from first three hundreds) +9=39\n- Units place for 8: 3\u00d710 +9=39\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4: hundreds (89) + tens (40) + units (39) = 89+40+39=168\n- 8: hundreds (0) + tens (39) + units (39)=0+39+39=78\n\nNow, let's add in the single-digit and two-digit numbers:\n\nSingle-digit (1-9):\n\n- 4:1\n- 8:1\n\nTwo-digit numbers (10-99):\n\n- 4:19 (as calculated earlier)\n- 8:19\n\nThree-digit numbers (100-488):\n\n- 4:168\n- 8:78\n\nSo, total occurrences:\n\n- 4:1+19+168=188\n- 8:1+19+78=98\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because 188-98=90, but I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in adding up.\n\nWait, single-digit: 4=1, 8=1\n\nTwo-digit: 4=19, 8=19\n\nThree-digit: 4=168, 8=78\n\nSo, total 4's:1+19=20 +168=188\n\nTotal 8's:1+19=20 +78=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the hundreds place for 4 was 89, tens 40, units 39, which adds up to 168. And for 8, tens 39, units 39, so 78. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify another way. Maybe calculate the total number of digits and see if the counts make sense.\n\nWait, from 1-9: 9 numbers, single-digit, 9 digits.\n\nFrom 10-99: 90 numbers, two-digit, 90\u00d72=180 digits.\n\nFrom 100-488: 488-99=389 numbers, three-digit, 389\u00d73=1167 digits.\n\nTotal digits:9+180+1167=1356 digits.\n\nWait, but 488 pages, each page has a page number, so total digits would be sum of digits from 1 to 488.\n\nBut maybe that's a side point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nWait, another approach: For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in units place? It's every 10 numbers, so floor(488/10)=48 full decades, each contributing one 4, so 48 times, plus if the last partial decade has a 4. The last number is 488, so the units digit goes up to 8, so the last 4 in units place is 484, which is within 480-488. So, total 49 times? Wait, no, wait: from 1-488, the number of times 4 appears in units place is floor(488/10)=48 full decades, each contributing one 4, and then check if the remaining numbers (488-480=8) include a 4. The remaining numbers are 481-488, which include 484, so that's one more. So, total 48+1=49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in units place: floor(488/10)=48 full decades, each contributing one 8, and the last partial decade (481-488) includes 488, so one more. So, 48+1=49 times.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier calculation, in three-digit numbers, units place for 4 was 39, but according to this, it's 49. There's a discrepancy here. So, I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated in the three-digit section. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, in the units place across all numbers from 1-488, 4 appears 49 times and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nBut according to my earlier calculation, in three-digit numbers, units place for 4 was 39, but if from 1-488, it's 49, then in single and two-digit numbers, units place for 4 is 1 (single-digit) +9 (two-digit)=10. So, 10+39=49, which matches. Similarly for 8: single-digit 1, two-digit 9, three-digit 39, total 1+9+39=49. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, so in two-digit numbers, units place for 4 is 9 times, which makes sense because from 10-99, the units digit cycles 0-9 ten times, so 10 times each digit, but wait, 10-99 is 90 numbers, so 9 decades, each contributing one 4 in units place, so 9 times for 4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in two-digit numbers, units place is 9 times.\n\nSo, in units place, total 49 each for 4 and 8.\n\nNow, tens place:\n\nFor 4 in tens place: from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn single-digit numbers, the tens place doesn't exist, so 0.\n\nIn two-digit numbers: 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nIn three-digit numbers: 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, 4 appears in the tens place 10 times per hundred block. There are four hundred blocks: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488.\n\nIn 100-199: 140-149:10\n200-299:240-249:10\n300-399:340-349:10\n400-488:440-449:10\nSo, total 40 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in tens place:\n\nIn two-digit numbers:80-89:10 times.\n\nIn three-digit numbers:\n\n180-189:10\n280-289:10\n380-389:10\n480-488: since 488 is the last page, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total for 8 in tens place:10 (two-digit) +10+10+10+9=49? Wait, no, let's see:\n\nWait, in three-digit numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39. Plus the two-digit 80-89:10, so total 39+10=49.\n\nWait, so in tens place, 4 appears 40 times and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier, in my detailed calculation, I had 4 appearing 40 times in the tens place and 8 appearing 39 times in the tens place. But now, using this method, 8 appears 49 times in the tens place. There's a conflict here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's clarify:\n\nIn two-digit numbers, 80-89:10 numbers, so 10 times for 8 in tens place.\n\nIn three-digit numbers:\n\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, total in three-digit tens place for 8:10+10+10+9=39\n\nAdding the two-digit 10, total 39+10=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 4 in tens place:\n\n- Two-digit:40-49:10\n- Three-digit:\n  - 140-149:10\n  - 240-249:10\n  - 340-349:10\n  - 440-449:10\nSo, total in three-digit tens place for 4:10\u00d74=40\nAdding two-digit 10: total 40+10=50? Wait, no, wait: in two-digit numbers, 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 times in tens place. In three-digit numbers, 140-149, etc., each is 10, so 10\u00d74=40. So, total 10+40=50 times for 4 in tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought 4 in tens place was 40, but now it's 50. That suggests an error in my previous calculation.\n\nWait, no, wait: in two-digit numbers, 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 times. In three-digit numbers, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: each is 10, so 4\u00d710=40. So, total 10+40=50 times for 4 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in tens place: two-digit 80-89:10, three-digit 180-189, etc., which is 10 each for the first three hundreds, and 9 for 480-488. So, 10\u00d73 +9=39 in three-digit, plus 10 in two-digit: total 49.\n\nSo, total 4 in tens place:50\n8 in tens place:49\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\n4 appears in 400-488:89 times.\n\n8 never appears in hundreds place.\n\nSo, total:\n\n4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50+89=188\n\n8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4 in tens place was 40, but now it's 50. I must have missed the two-digit numbers in the previous calculation. So, the correct total is 188 for 4's and 98 for 8's, difference 90.\n\nI think this is the correct answer. So, the final answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each digit place one by one for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, 4 and 8 each appear once every 10 numbers. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4) and 8 appears once (page 8). This pattern continues up to page 488. \n\nWait, but I should check if 488 is included. The last page is 488, which is a three-digit number. So, the units digit goes up to 8 in the last page. Let me calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place.\n\nFirst, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and an extra 8 numbers (481-488). In each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for 8. So, for 48 complete groups, that's 48 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\nNow, the remaining numbers from 481 to 488: the units digits here are 1 through 8. So, in this partial group, the units digit 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, adding these, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and similarly for 8's, it's 48 + 1 = 49. So, both have the same count in the units place. Hmm, interesting.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. In the tens place, 4 and 8 each appear in a block of 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 (10 times) and 8 for 80-89 (10 times). This pattern repeats every 100 numbers.\n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then the remaining 88 numbers (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49) and 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for both 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 numbers: 401-488. Let's break this down. The tens digit in 401-409 is 0, so no 4 or 8 there. Then, 410-419: tens digit is 1, so again no 4 or 8. Similarly, 420-429: tens digit is 2, 430-439: tens digit is 3, 440-449: tens digit is 4. Oh, wait, so from 440-449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 more 4's in the tens place.\n\nThen, 450-459: tens digit is 5, 460-469: 6, 470-479:7, and 480-488: tens digit is 8. From 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480-488), so the tens digit is 8 for all these, adding 9 more 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, in the remaining 88 numbers, we have 10 more 4's in the tens place (440-449) and 9 more 8's in the tens place (480-488). \n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 = 50. And the total number of 8's in the tens place is 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nSo far, for the tens place, 4's have 50 and 8's have 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 numbers (400-488 inclusive). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit cycles every 1000, and since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears zero times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's in the hundreds place: 89, and 8's: 0.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let me add 49 + 50 first, which is 99, then +89 is 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- From 1-480, 48 groups of 10, so 48 4's and 48 8's.\n- Then 481-488: 484 and 488, so 1 each. Total units: 49 each. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- 4 complete hundreds: 40 each.\n- Then 401-488:\n  - 440-449: 10 4's.\n  - 480-488: 9 8's.\nSo, 4's: 40 +10=50, 8's:40+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: 89 4's.\n- 8's: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89= 188. Yes, that's right.\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98. Correct.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. In the tens place, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 for each, so 9 8's. That's correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\nSo, yeah, the difference is 90. So, 4's are printed 90 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place. 488 - 400 +1 = 89. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: from 1-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. No 8's in hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, hold on, I think I might have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, in the tens place, for each hundred, 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place per hundred. There are 4 complete hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), 440-449 is another 10 4's in the tens place. So total 50 4's in the tens place. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: each hundred has 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, 4 complete hundreds give 40 8's. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, 49 total for 8's in the tens place. Correct.\n\nUnits place: as before, 49 each.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 4's. Correct.\n\nAnd in the hundreds place, 8 never appears because the book ends at 488, which is less than 800. So, 8's in hundreds place:0.\n\nYes, so 89 4's in hundreds place, and 0 8's. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to verify: total number of digits printed.\n\nWait, maybe not necessary, but just to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nBut I think my earlier approach is correct. So, I'm confident that the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 4 and 8 each appear once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 480: 48 groups of 10 \u2192 48 each.\n   - From 481-488: 1 each (484 and 488).\n   - Total 4's: 49, Total 8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 (e.g., 40-49) and 10 of 8 (e.g., 80-89).\n   - From 1-400: 4 hundreds \u2192 40 each.\n   - From 401-488: 440-449 adds 10 4's; 480-488 adds 9 8's.\n   - Total 4's: 50, Total 8's: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488 (89 times); 8 never appears.\n   - Total 4's: 89, Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI think the best approach is to count the number of 4's and 8's in each of these ranges separately and then compare them. Let me start by considering each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I'll calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the single-digit pages (1-9), the numbers 4 and 8 each appear once. So, units place contributes 1 to both 4's and 8's count.\n\nNext, for the two-digit numbers (10-99), each units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 9 times (since there are 9 sets of 10 in 90). Wait, no, actually, from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers, so each units digit (including 4 and 8) appears 9 times. So, in the units place for two-digit numbers, 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for two-digit numbers, each digit from 1 to 9 appears 10 times. So, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (from 40-49), and the same for 8 (from 80-89). So, tens place contributes 10 to both 4's and 8's count.\n\nNow, moving on to the three-digit numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Let's break this down into hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit 4 only goes up to 488, not 499. So, for the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400 to 488. Let's see how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, for the hundreds digit 8, but wait, 800 is beyond 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8 contributes 0 in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place for three-digit numbers. Let's consider each hundred block separately.\n\nFrom 100-199: The tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, each tens digit appears 10 times. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's from 140-149, which is 10 times. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place, it's from 180-189, which is 10 times.\n\nFrom 200-299: Same logic, 4 in tens place appears 10 times (240-249), and 8 appears 10 times (280-289).\n\nFrom 300-399: Again, 4 in tens place (340-349) and 8 in tens place (380-389), each 10 times.\n\nFrom 400-488: Now, this is a bit different because it doesn't go up to 499. Let's calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nFor 4 in the tens place: 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place: 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n\nSo, total for tens place in three-digit numbers:\n\n4 appears: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-449) = 40 times.\n\n8 appears: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nNow, the units place for three-digit numbers. Again, let's consider each hundred block.\n\nFrom 100-199: Each units digit from 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, from 200-299: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\nFrom 300-399: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\nFrom 400-488: Now, the units digit cycles from 0-9, but we only go up to 488. Let's see how many complete sets of 10 we have here.\n\nFrom 400-488, that's 89 numbers. So, how many complete decades are there? 89 divided by 10 is 8 with a remainder of 9. So, each digit from 0-9 appears 8 times, and then digits 0-8 appear one more time. So, for 4 and 8:\n\n4 appears 8 times in each of the 8 complete decades, and then one more time in the incomplete decade (since 488 ends with 8, but 4 is within 400-409, which is part of the first incomplete set? Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nActually, from 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 eight times (400-479), and then 480-488 is the ninth partial cycle, which goes up to 8.\n\nSo, for each digit, 0-9, they appear 8 times in the complete cycles, and then digits 0-8 appear one more time in the partial cycle. So, 4 appears 8 + 1 = 9 times, and 8 appears 8 + 1 = 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 400-479, that's 80 numbers, so 8 complete decades (each 10 numbers). So, each digit appears 8 times in the units place. Then, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the units digits here are 0-8, each appearing once. Therefore, 4 appears once more, and 8 appears once more. So, total for units place in 400-488: 8 + 1 = 9 for both 4 and 8.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so units digits are 0-8, so 4 appears once, and 8 appears once. So, total units digits in 400-488: 8 (from 400-479) +1 (from 480-488) = 9 for both 4 and 8.\n\nTherefore, units place in three-digit numbers:\n\n4 appears: 10 (100-199) +10 (200-299) +10 (300-399) +9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\n8 appears: 10 (100-199) +10 (200-299) +10 (300-399) +9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 480-488 would add 1 more for both 4 and 8, but actually, in 480-488, 4 is in 484, so only once, and 8 is in 488, so once. So, yes, 9 times each.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences for 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with 4:\n\n- Units place: 1 (single-digit) +9 (two-digit) +39 (three-digit) = 49 times.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me correct that. Wait, in two-digit numbers, the units place for 4 is 9 times, and the tens place is 10 times, so total for two-digit numbers is 19 times for 4.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me reorganize.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to separate each digit place across all page numbers.\n\nSo, let's calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n- Pages 1-9: 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\n- Pages 10-99: Each units digit 0-9 appears 9 times (since 90 numbers, 9 sets of 10). So, 4 appears 9 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n- Pages 100-488: Let's calculate how many times each units digit appears.\n\nFrom 100-488, the units digit cycles every 10 pages. The total number of pages is 488 - 100 + 1 = 389 pages.\n\nNumber of complete decades in 389 pages: 389 // 10 = 38 complete decades, and 9 extra pages.\n\nEach units digit (0-9) appears 38 times in the units place from 100-479, and then in 480-488, units digits are 0-8, so each appears once more.\n\nSo, for 4 and 8:\n\n- Units place in 100-479: 38 times each.\n- Units place in 480-488: 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488).\n- So total units place for 4: 38 +1 =39.\n- Similarly, 8:38 +1=39.\n\nSo, total units place across all pages:\n\n4: 1 (1-9) +9 (10-99) +39 (100-488) =49.\n8:1 +9 +39=49.\n\nWait, so both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nNow, moving to the tens place:\n\n- Pages 1-9: There is no tens digit, so 0 occurrences for both 4 and 8.\n- Pages 10-99: Each tens digit from 1-9 appears 10 times. So, 4 appears 10 times (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n- Pages 100-488: Let's calculate the tens digit.\n\nEach hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) contributes to the tens place.\n\nFor each hundred block except the last, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in 100-199, 200-299, and 300-399, each tens digit appears 10 times per hundred, so 3 hundreds *10=30 times for 4 and 30 times for 8.\n\nNow, for 400-488:\n\nThe tens digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for tens digit 4, it appears from 440-449, which is 10 times. For tens digit 8, it appears from 480-488, which is 9 times (since 488 is the last page).\n\nSo, in 400-488, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total tens place:\n\n4:10 (100-199) +10 (200-299) +10 (300-399) +10 (400-449) =40.\n8:10 (100-199) +10 (200-299) +10 (300-399) +9 (480-488)=39.\n\nSo, total tens place across all pages:\n\n4:40.\n8:39.\n\nNow, moving to the hundreds place:\n\n- Pages 1-99: No hundreds digit, so 0.\n- Pages 100-999: But our book ends at 488, so hundreds digits go up to 4.\n\nEach hundreds digit appears as follows:\n\n- 1: 100-199, which is 100 numbers, so hundreds digit 1 appears 100 times.\n- 2: 200-299, 100 times.\n- 3: 300-399, 100 times.\n- 4: 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488-400+1=89).\n\nSo, hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\n8 never appears in the hundreds place because 800 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, total hundreds place:\n\n4:89.\n8:0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all occurrences for 4 and 8.\n\nFor 4:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:40\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal 4's:49+40+89=178.\n\nFor 8:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:39\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal 8's:49+39+0=88.\n\nSo, the difference is 178 -88=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- 1-9:1 each.\n- 10-99:9 each.\n- 100-488:39 each.\nTotal:1+9+39=49 each. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- 1-99:10 each for 4 and 8 in two-digit numbers.\n- 100-199,200-299,300-399:10 each per hundred, so 3*10=30 each.\n- 400-488:10 for 4, 9 for 8.\nTotal 4's tens:10+30+10=50? Wait, no, earlier I thought it was 40, but now I'm confused.\n\nWait, no, earlier I considered that in two-digit numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89). Then, in three-digit numbers, for each hundred block except the last, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 3 hundreds *10=30. Plus, in 400-488, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total tens place for 4:10 (two-digit) +30 (three-digit hundreds 1-3) +10 (400-449)=50. Similarly, 8:10 (two-digit) +30 (three-digit hundreds 1-3) +9 (480-488)=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's tens place was 40. So, I must have made a mistake in the earlier calculation. Let me correct this.\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, tens place for 4:10 times (40-49), and 8:10 times (80-89).\n\nIn three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-199: tens digit 4 appears 10 times (140-149), same for 8 (180-189).\n- 200-299: same, 10 each.\n- 300-399: same, 10 each.\n- 400-488: tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, total tens place for 4:10 (two-digit) +10+10+10 (three-digit hundreds 1-3) +10 (400-449) =10+30+10=50.\n\nFor 8:10 (two-digit) +10+10+10 (three-digit hundreds 1-3) +9 (480-488)=10+30+9=49.\n\nSo, earlier I must have miscalculated, thinking it was 40, but it's actually 50 for 4 and 49 for 8 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, hundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n- 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total for 4:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 178-88=90, but that was due to a miscalculation in the tens place. So, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me confirm again.\n\nWait, units place:49 each.\n\nTens place:4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nHundreds place:4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0.\n\nSo, 4's total:49+50+89=188.\n\n8's total:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is that there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Pages 1-9: 1 occurrence each of 4 and 8.\n- Pages 10-99: Each digit 0-9 appears 9 times in the units place, so 9 each.\n- Pages 100-488: Each digit 0-9 appears 38 times in complete decades (100-479) and once more in the incomplete decade (480-488), totaling 39 each.\n- Total units place: 1 + 9 + 39 = 49 each.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Pages 1-99: 10 occurrences each of 4 and 8 in the tens place (40-49 and 80-89).\n- Pages 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred, so 30 each.\n- Pages 400-488: 10 occurrences of 4 (440-449) and 9 occurrences of 8 (480-488).\n- Total tens place: 10 + 30 + 10 = 50 for 4; 10 + 30 + 9 = 49 for 8.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- Pages 400-488: 89 occurrences of 4; no occurrences of 8.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Let me start by counting the number of 4's and 8's in each section separately.\n\nFirst, for the single-digit pages (1-9): The digits here are 1 through 9. So, the digit 4 appears once (page 4), and the digit 8 appears once (page 8). So, in single-digit pages, both 4 and 8 occur once each.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit pages (10-99). Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nStarting with the tens place for two-digit numbers:\n- For the tens digit, 4 appears from 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n- Similarly, 8 appears from 80 to 89, so that's another 10 times for the digit 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers:\n- The digit 4 appears once in every set of ten numbers, like 14, 24, 34, ..., 94. That's 9 times (since 44 is already counted in the tens place, but wait, no, actually, in the units place, 44 is counted once as the units digit and once as the tens digit, but when we're counting separately, we should consider each occurrence. So, from 10 to 99, the units digit 4 appears 9 times (14,24,...,94). Wait, actually, that's 9 times, because 44 is included, but we're only looking at the units place here. Similarly, the units digit 8 appears 9 times (18,28,...,98). \n\nWait, but 40-49 have 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, but the units digits go from 0-9, so in the units place, 4 appears once in each ten, including 44. So, actually, from 10 to 99, the units digit 4 appears 9 times (14,24,...,94), which is correct because 44 is the 4th occurrence in the 40s. Similarly, 8 appears 9 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. From 10 to 99, each ten (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.) has exactly one number where the units digit is 4. So, from 10 to 99, that's 9 tens (10-90), each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 9 times. Same for 8 in the units place: 9 times.\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 times. Similarly, the total number of 8's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 times. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought single-digit pages had 1 each, so maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, no, in two-digit numbers, the tens place for 4 is 10 times (40-49), and the units place for 4 is 9 times (14,24,...,94). So, 10 + 9 = 19 4's. Similarly, for 8's, it's 10 (80-89) + 9 (18,28,...,98) = 19 8's. So, in two-digit pages, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit pages, which are from 100 to 488. Here, each page number has a hundreds place, tens place, and units place. I need to count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n- When the hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3, the hundreds place doesn't contribute any 4's or 8's.\n- When the hundreds digit is 4, it contributes 4's in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. Let's see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 page numbers, contributing 89 4's.\n\nNow, for the tens place in three-digit numbers:\n- For each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.), and similarly for 8.\n\nBut let's break it down:\n\n- For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each of these groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 140-149). So, for each of these three groups, that's 10 4's in the tens place, totaling 3*10=30 4's. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place, each group has 10 numbers (180-189, etc.), so 3*10=30 8's.\n\n- For the hundreds digit 4 (400-488), the tens digit can go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8, which is 9 tens digits. The digit 4 appears once in the tens place (440-449), which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 4's. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488, which is 9 pages: 480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers, contributing 9 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check: From 400 to 488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, for tens digit 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For tens digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, the 8 in the tens place appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 40 4's.\n\nTotal 8's in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Similarly, for each hundreds group, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9.\n\nFor 4's in the units place:\n- In each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the units digit 4 appears once per ten, so 10 times per group. So, 3 groups * 10 = 30 4's.\n- In the 400-488 group, the units digit 4 appears in each ten, but the last group ends at 488. So, from 400 to 488, how many times does the units digit 4 appear? It's once every ten, so from 400 to 488, that's 9 full tens (400-409, 410-419,...,480-488). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so in 480-488, the units digit 4 appears at 484. So, in each ten, the units digit 4 appears once, so from 400-488, that's 9 tens (400-488 is 89 numbers, which is 9 full tens and a partial ten? Wait, no, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is 9 full tens (400-409, 410-419,...,480-488). Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is 9 full tens (each 10 numbers) and 9 extra numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is 8 full tens (400-409, 410-419,...,470-479) and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears once in each full ten, so 8 times, plus once in 484, so total 9 times.\n\nWait, but actually, from 400-488, the units digit 4 appears at 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 times. So, in the 400-488 group, units digit 4 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in the units place for three-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39 4's.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place:\n- In each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the units digit 8 appears once per ten, so 10 times per group. So, 3 groups * 10 = 30 8's.\n- In the 400-488 group, the units digit 8 appears at 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 times, as 488 is included.\n\nSo, total 8's in the units place for three-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's and 8's across all page numbers.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit:\n  - Hundreds place: 89\n  - Tens place: 40\n  - Units place: 39\nTotal 4's = 1 + 19 + (89 + 40 + 39) = 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168. Then 168 + 19 (two-digit) + 1 (single-digit) = 188. Hmm, that seems high. Let me see if I made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, the hundreds place for 4's is 89, which is correct because from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Then, in the tens place, I had 40 4's, which is 30 from 100-399 and 10 from 400-488. Wait, no, earlier I thought in the tens place, for three-digit numbers, 4's in the tens place were 30 (from 100-399) plus 10 (from 400-488) totaling 40. Similarly, units place for 4's were 30 (from 100-399) plus 9 (from 400-488) totaling 39. So, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168, which seems correct.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit:\n  - Hundreds place: 0 (since 800-899 isn't included, as the book ends at 488)\n  - Tens place: 39 (from earlier calculation)\n  - Units place: 39\nWait, no, in the three-digit numbers, for 8's in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the tens place in three-digit numbers, 8's were 39: 30 from 100-399 and 9 from 400-488. Wait, no, earlier I had 30 from 100-399 and 9 from 400-488, totaling 39.\n\nSimilarly, units place for 8's in three-digit numbers were 30 from 100-399 and 9 from 400-488, totaling 39.\n\nSo, total 8's: 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 1 + 19 + 39 + 39 = 98.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 1 + 19 = 20, 20 + 39 = 59, 59 + 39 = 98.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188 - 98 = 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 188 seems high for 4's.\n\nWait, let's go back to the three-digit numbers.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nTens place: For each of the first three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 3*10=30. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. So, 30 + 10 = 40 4's in the tens place. Correct.\n\nUnits place: For each of the first three hundreds, 10 numbers where the units digit is 4, so 3*10=30. In 400-488, units digit 4 appears 9 times (as 484 is included). So, 30 + 9 = 39. Correct.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 4's in three-digit numbers. Plus single-digit (1) and two-digit (19): 168 + 19 + 1 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nHundreds place: 0, as the book ends at 488, so no 800-899 pages.\n\nTens place: For 100-399, each hundreds group has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8, so 3*10=30. In 400-488, tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. Total 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nUnits place: For 100-399, each hundreds group has 10 numbers where units digit is 8, so 3*10=30. In 400-488, units digit 8 appears at 408,418,...,488, which is 9 numbers. So, 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, total 8's: 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 1 + 19 = 20, 20 + 39 = 59, 59 + 39 = 98.\n\nSo, 4's:188, 8's:98, difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again: Is there a possibility I overcounted in the three-digit numbers? For example, in the units place, when I count 4's in 400-488 as 9, but 488 is included, so 484 is the last one, which is correct. Similarly, for 8's in the units place, 488 is included, so that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a different approach, like considering each digit position separately across all page numbers.\n\nAnother way: For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nUnits digit:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIn each block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, in each block, 4 appears once. How many complete blocks are there in 488 numbers?\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48*1=48. Then, in the incomplete block (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 4 appears once at 484. So, total units digit 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8's: In each block of 10, 8 appears once, so 48 complete blocks give 48 8's. In the incomplete block (481-488), 8 appears at 488, so total 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but this contradicts my earlier count where units digit 4's were 39 and 8's were 39. Hmm, so which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the previous approach. Let me check this units digit method.\n\nWait, using this method, units digit 4's: 49, units digit 8's:49. So, same number.\n\nSimilarly, for tens digit:\n\nTens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), same for 8.\n\nSo, from 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each.\n\nNow, the remaining numbers from 401-488: 88 numbers. The tens digit here cycles from 0-8 (since 488 is the end). So, in the tens place, 4 appears once (440-449), which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. Similarly, 8 appears once in the tens place (480-488), which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's.\n\nSo, total tens digit 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal tens digit 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 40 4's and 39 8's in the tens place, which was part of the three-digit count. Hmm, maybe the discrepancy is because in the three-digit count, I considered 100-399 and 400-488 separately, but perhaps this method is more accurate.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nUsing this method:\n\nUnits digit 4's:49, units digit 8's:49.\n\nTens digit 4's:50, tens digit 8's:49.\n\nHundreds digit 4's: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nHundreds digit 8's: 0, as the book doesn't go beyond 488.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nSo, same as before, 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but in the units digit approach, I got 49 each for 4 and 8, which is different from my initial three-digit count where I had 39 each. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial three-digit count. Let me reconcile this.\n\nIn the three-digit count, I considered that from 100-399, units digit 4's were 30, but using the units digit method, it's 49. That suggests that perhaps my initial approach was wrong.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nWait, when I used the units digit method, I considered all page numbers from 1 to 488, so including single-digit and two-digit numbers. So, the total units digit 4's are 49, which includes single-digit (4), two-digit (14,24,...,94), and three-digit (104,114,...,484).\n\nSimilarly, in the initial three-digit count, I only considered 100-488, so perhaps I missed the single-digit and two-digit contributions. Wait, no, in the initial three-digit count, I added single-digit and two-digit separately.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the methods. Let me try to clarify.\n\nIn the initial approach, I separated single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers and counted 4's and 8's in each. Now, in the digit-by-digit approach, I'm considering all page numbers and counting each digit position separately.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is correct, but the digit-by-digit approach is also correct, and both lead to the same total.\n\nWait, in the initial approach, for three-digit numbers, units digit 4's were 39, but in the digit-by-digit approach, units digit 4's are 49, which includes single-digit and two-digit. So, that suggests that in the initial approach, I might have made a mistake by not including single-digit and two-digit in the three-digit count.\n\nWait, no, in the initial approach, I treated single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit separately, so the 49 units digit 4's would include single-digit (1), two-digit (9), and three-digit (39), totaling 49. So, 1 + 9 + 39 =49, which matches the digit-by-digit approach.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: single-digit (1) + two-digit (9) + three-digit (39) =49.\n\nSo, in the initial approach, when I calculated three-digit units digit 4's as 39, that was correct because I was only considering 100-488. Then, adding single-digit and two-digit, I had 1 + 9 + 39 =49, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for tens digit 4's: in the initial approach, I had 40 in three-digit numbers, which includes 100-488. But in the digit-by-digit approach, I had 50 4's in the tens place, which includes single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit. Wait, but single-digit and two-digit don't have a hundreds digit, so perhaps I'm conflating things.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust the initial approach to include all digit positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the digit-by-digit approach is more straightforward.\n\nSo, using the digit-by-digit approach:\n\nFor each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits digit:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nAs calculated, 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nTens digit:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nEach hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0-8. So, the tens digit 4 appears once (440-449), which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nSo, total tens digit 4's: 40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\nEach complete hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4*10=40.\n\nIn the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears once, from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens digit 8's:40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds digit:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place?\n\nOnly from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nHow many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? 0, since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, hundreds digit 4's:89, hundreds digit 8's:0.\n\nNow, summing up all 4's and 8's:\n\n4's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal 4's=49+50+89=188.\n\n8's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal 8's=49+49+0=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. \n\nFirst, for single-digit page numbers (1-9), the only 4 is on page 4. So that's one 4.\n\nNext, for two-digit page numbers (10-99), I need to consider both the tens and units place. \n\nIn the tens place, the numbers from 40 to 49 will have a 4 in the tens digit. That's 10 pages (40, 41, ..., 49), so that's 10 fours.\n\nIn the units place, the 4 appears once every ten numbers. So from 10 to 99, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 ten times. So in each ten, there's one 4. That would be 9 times (since 10-99 is nine tens), but wait, no, actually, from 10-99, it's 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of ten. So each set contributes one 4 in the units place. So that's 9 fours. Wait, but wait, 10-19: 14, 20-29:24, ..., 90-99:94. That's 9 fours. So in the units place, 9 fours.\n\nSo for two-digit numbers, total fours are 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 fours.\n\nNow, for three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Let's break this down into hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nFirst, hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But when the hundreds digit is 4, the numbers go up to 488, so we have to be careful.\n\nBut let's first count the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only for pages 400 to 488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since our book ends at 488, it's 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, the tens place for three-digit numbers. Let's think about how often 4 appears in the tens digit. For each hundred block, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So in 100-199, the tens digit is 4 for 140-149, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 200-299, it's 240-249, another 10. In 300-399, it's 340-349, another 10. And in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So total in the tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 fours.\n\nWait, but wait, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So total tens place fours: 40.\n\nNow, the units place for three-digit numbers. Similarly, in each hundred block, the units digit cycles 0-9. So in each hundred, the units digit is 4 once every ten numbers. So for 100-199, units digit 4 occurs 10 times (104, 114, ..., 194). Similarly for 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. \n\nWait, but for 400-488, how many times does the units digit 4 occur? Let's see: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times because 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last one with units digit 4. So for 400-488, units digit 4 occurs 9 times.\n\nSo total units digit fours in three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 fours.\n\nSo total fours in three-digit numbers: hundreds (89) + tens (40) + units (39) = 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 fours.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Hundreds place: 89 fours. Tens place: 40 fours. Units place: 39 fours. So total fours: 89 + 40 = 129, plus 39 is 168.\n\nNow, let's check if that makes sense. From 100-488, that's 389 numbers (488 - 100 + 1 = 389). But the count for fours is 168. Hmm, seems plausible.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's using the same method.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9): the only 8 is on page 8. So that's one 8.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers (10-99):\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 for numbers 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 eights.\n\nUnits place: The units digit is 8 once every ten numbers. So from 10-99, that's 9 sets of ten, each contributing one 8. So 9 eights.\n\nSo total eights in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 eights.\n\nThree-digit page numbers (100-488):\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: Let's see how many times 8 appears in the tens digit. For each hundred block, the tens digit cycles 0-9. So in 100-199, the tens digit is 8 for 180-189, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 200-299: 280-289, another 10. In 300-399: 380-389, another 10. In 400-488: the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page. So from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So in the tens place, for 400-488, it's 9 eights.\n\nSo total tens place eights: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 eights.\n\nUnits place: Similarly, in each hundred block, the units digit is 8 once every ten numbers. So for 100-199: 108, 118, ..., 198: 10 eights. For 200-299: 208, 218, ..., 298: 10 eights. For 300-399: 308, 318, ..., 398: 10 eights. For 400-488: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 eights because 488 is included, so 488 is the last one, making it 9 eights.\n\nSo total units place eights: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 eights.\n\nSo total eights in three-digit numbers: tens (39) + units (39) = 78 eights.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Tens place: 39 eights, units place: 39 eights, so total 78.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the eights:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\nTwo-digit: 19\nThree-digit: 78\nTotal eights: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98 eights.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait, I think I made a mistake. Let me recount.\n\nWait, for two-digit numbers, I had 10 eights in tens place and 9 in units place, totaling 19. That's correct. For three-digit numbers, hundreds place: 0, tens place: 39, units place: 39, so 78. So total eights: 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98 eights.\n\nWait, but let me check three-digit numbers again. For tens place, in 100-199, 180-189: 10 eights. Similarly for 200-299, 300-399, each has 10 eights in the tens place. So that's 3*10=30. Then, in 400-488, tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So total tens place eights: 30 + 9 = 39. Correct.\n\nFor units place, in 100-199: 10 eights, same for 200-299, 300-399, each 10. So 3*10=30. In 400-488: 408, 418, ..., 488. Let's count: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 eights. So total units place eights: 30 + 9 = 39. So yes, 39.\n\nSo three-digit eights: 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78. Correct.\n\nSo total eights: 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98 eights.\n\nNow, let's recount the fours:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\nTwo-digit: 19\nThree-digit: 168\nTotal fours: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188 fours.\n\nWait, 1 + 19 is 20, plus 168 is 188.\n\nSo the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems high, but maybe it's correct.\n\nWait, let me go through the counts again.\n\nFours:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 4)\nTwo-digit:\n- Tens place: 40-49: 10 fours\n- Units place: 14,24,...,94: 9 fours\nTotal two-digit fours: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 fours\n- Tens place: 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: 10 each, so 40 fours\n- Units place: 104,114,...,194 (10), 204,...,294 (10), 304,...,394 (10), 404,...,484 (9). So 10+10+10+9=39 fours\nTotal three-digit fours: 89+40+39=168\n\nTotal fours: 1+19+168=188\n\nEights:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 8)\nTwo-digit:\n- Tens place: 80-89: 10 eights\n- Units place: 18,28,...,98: 9 eights\nTotal two-digit eights: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488: 10+10+10+9=39 eights\n- Units place: 108,118,...,198 (10), 208,...,298 (10), 308,...,398 (10), 408,...,488 (9). So 10+10+10+9=39 eights\nTotal three-digit eights: 39+39=78\n\nTotal eights: 1+19+78=98\n\nDifference: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.\n\nHmm, so the answer would be 90 more fours than eights. That seems correct based on the calculations. I think I've double-checked each part, so I'm confident.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I'll calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place. In the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each set of ten numbers. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers. \n\nSo, for the units place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Each group of 10 numbers has one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a digit, I think it's actually 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4, and then in the last partial group, from 481 to 488, the units digits go up to 8, so 484 would be the next 4. So, that's one more 4. So, total 4's in units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that. From 1 to 488, how many complete decades are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then in the 49th decade, which is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 is in this range, so that's one more 4. So, total 49 4's in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, it's the same logic. Each decade has one 8, so 48 complete decades give 48 8's, and in the last partial decade, 488 is included, which is an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more 8, making it 49 8's in the units place.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so in the last partial decade, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 488 is the last number, which is an 8 in the units place. So, yes, that's one more 8. So, total 49 8's in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers.\n\nSo, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see. From 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4 times 10 is 40.\n\nNow, in the incomplete hundred, which is 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last number). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 40-49, but wait, in this case, it's 400-409, right? Because the tens digit is 0 for 400-409, then 1 for 410-419, up to 8 for 480-488. Wait, no, actually, in the 400-488 range, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, the digit 4 in the tens place would be from 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last number, so 480-488 is the last set. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 = 50 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, let's see. In each complete hundred, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4 complete hundreds would give 4*10=40 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, in the incomplete hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last one. So, that's 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 8's in the tens place in the incomplete hundred. So, total 8's in the tens place would be 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but hold on. In the complete hundreds, each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds would be 40. Then in the incomplete hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so that's correct. So, total 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0. From 100-488, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAs for 8's in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. The highest hundreds digit is 4, so there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's tally up all the 4's and 8's.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 49\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nAdding up 4's: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct.\n\nAdding up 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 4's. Let me recheck that.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's:\n- Each complete hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 4's in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4 hundreds give 4*10=40.\n\nIn the incomplete hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place:\n- Each complete hundred gives 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nIn the incomplete hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, I'm counting 89 4's because from 400-488, that's 89 numbers. Let me confirm: 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place. Let me check again.\n\nFor units place:\n- Each group of 10 numbers has one 4 and one 8.\n\nTotal page numbers: 488.\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: 48 (since 48*10=480), and then 8 remaining numbers (481-488).\n\nIn each complete group, one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 groups give 48 4's and 48 8's.\n\nIn the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, that's one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488).\n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 48 +1=49.\n\nTotal 8's in units place: 48 +1=49.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place, as checked earlier, 4's have 50 and 8's have 49.\n\nHundreds place: 4's have 89, 8's have 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be different. Let me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units place:\n- For each digit from 0-9, the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor(N/10)*1 + min(max(N%10, digit), digit) if digit < (N%10) else 0. Hmm, maybe that's more complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that in each position, each digit appears approximately the same number of times, except for the last partial group.\n\nSo, for units place, the number of times 4 appears is (488 // 10) + (1 if 4 <= (488 % 10) else 0). Wait, 488 //10 is 48, and 488 %10 is 8. Since 4 <=8, we add 1, so 49. Similarly for 8, it's 48 + (1 if 8 <=8 else 0)=49.\n\nSame for tens place: For 4, it's (488 // 100)*10 + (10 if 4 <= (488 //10) %10 else 0). Wait, 488//100=4, so 4*10=40. Then, 488//10=48, so 48%10=8. Since 4<=8, we add 10, making it 50. For 8, it's (488//100)*10=40, plus (10 if 8 <= (488//10)%10 else 0). 48//10=4, 4%10=4. Since 8>4, we don't add anything, but wait, that's not correct because in the tens place, the digit 8 can appear in the incomplete group.\n\nWait, perhaps a better formula is needed. Let me think.\n\nIn the tens place, the number of times a digit d appears is:\n\n- For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, digit d appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\n- Then, for the incomplete hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 up to (N//10)%10. So, if the incomplete hundred has numbers up to (N//10)%10, then digit d appears once for each occurrence in that range.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to calculate it as:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to N is:\n\ncomplete_hundreds = N // 100\n\npartial_tens = (N // 10) % 10\n\ncount = complete_hundreds * 10\n\nif d < partial_tens:\n    count += 10\nelif d == partial_tens:\n    count += (N % 10) + 1\nelse:\n    pass\n\nWait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me try with d=4 and N=488.\n\ncomplete_hundreds = 488 // 100 =4\n\npartial_tens = (488 //10) %10 =48%10=8\n\nSo, for d=4:\n\nif 4 <8, then count +=10. So, total count=4*10 +10=50. That's correct.\n\nFor d=8:\n\nif 8<8? No. So, if d=8, since 8==partial_tens=8, then count += (488%10)+1=8+1=9. So, total count=4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, using this formula, for d=4 in tens place:50, d=8:49.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds place:\n\nNumber of times d appears in hundreds place is:\n\nif d < (N//100 +1), then count += (min(d, N//100)) *100.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, etc.\n\nSo, for d=4, it's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nFor d=8, since N=488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0 times.\n\nSo, yes, hundreds place:4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: units 49 + tens 50 + hundreds 89=188.\n\nTotal 8's: units 49 + tens 49 + hundreds 0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me confirm.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488-400+1=89. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 times. Correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 4's would be 90, but no, it's 89. Hmm.\n\nWait, 400 is the first page with hundreds digit 4, and 488 is the last. So, 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check once more by considering each position again.\n\nUnits place:\n- 4's:49\n- 8's:49\n\nTens place:\n- 4's:50\n- 8's:49\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's:89\n- 8's:0\n\nAdding up:\n4's:49+50=99; 99+89=188\n8's:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI remember that when counting digits, it's often helpful to break the problem down by the number of digits. So, I'll start by calculating how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers, and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. \n\nFirst, I'll consider the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many such blocks are there?\n\nThe total number of page numbers is 488, so the number of complete blocks of 10 is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a block, we'll take the integer part, which is 48 complete blocks. Each block contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, the last partial block is from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers. In this partial block, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (at 484). So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let me figure out how many such blocks there are.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the hundreds digits go up to 4 (since 488 is 400-something). So, we have the 40-49 block in the first hundred, 140-149 in the second, 240-249 in the third, and 340-349 in the fourth. Each of these contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So that's 4 blocks times 10, which is 40. Now, wait, the last hundred is 400-488, which is only 89 numbers (since 488 is the last). But the tens digit in this block would go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is 488, so 480-488 is part of this). Wait, no, the tens digit in 400-488 would be 0 (for 400-409), 1 (410-419), ..., up to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is a full block. So, that's another 10. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is a full block of 10, so that's 10 more 4's in the tens place. So, total tens place 4's are 4 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349) times 10, which is 40, plus the 440-449 block, which is another 10, so 50 in total. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 1-488, the tens digit 4 appears in the following ranges: 40-49 (10 times), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. In each of these, the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's are units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's are 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's. Starting with the units place. Similar to 4's, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers in the units place. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then, the last partial block is 481-488, which includes 488. The units digits here go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more (at 488). So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 in the tens place appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, we have 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), and 380-389 (10). That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Now, does 480-488 include another block where the tens digit is 8? Yes, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 in all these numbers, so that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89 (10 times), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 times). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's are 0.\n\nSo, total 8's are units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems a bit low. Let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 1-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's are 188 and total 8's are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: Let's think about how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units place:\n\n- For 4's: Each 10 numbers contribute 1, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the last partial ten (481-488) which has one 4 at 484. So, 49.\n\n- For 8's: Similarly, 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the last partial ten (481-488) which has one 8 at 488. So, 49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 4's: Each hundred has one block of 10 where tens digit is 4, so 4 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10, so 40. Plus the 440-449 block in the 400s, which is another 10, so total 50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 440-449 is within 488, which it is, so that's correct.\n\n- For 8's: Each hundred has one block of 10 where tens digit is 8, so 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10, so 40. Plus the 480-488 block, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more. Total 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- For 4's: Only from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\n- For 8's: None, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I thought about the 4's in the tens place, I considered 440-449 as another block, making it 5 blocks in total, each contributing 10, so 50. But earlier, I thought it was 5 blocks, but in the 400s, it's only one block, 440-449, so that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: Let's calculate the total number of page numbers. 488 pages, so 488 page numbers. The total number of digits printed would be:\n\n- Pages 1-9: 9 pages, 1 digit each: 9 digits.\n\n- Pages 10-99: 90 pages, 2 digits each: 180 digits.\n\n- Pages 100-488: 389 pages, 3 digits each: 1167 digits.\n\nTotal digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits.\n\nNow, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90. Let me see if that makes sense in terms of the total digits.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to stick with the initial calculation. So, I think my answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's in each range. \n\nFirst, the single-digit pages: from 1 to 9. The only single-digit number that has a 4 is page 4 itself. So that's 1 occurrence of the digit 4.\n\nNext, the two-digit pages: from 10 to 99. Here, the 4 can appear in the tens place or the units place. \n\nFor the tens place: The tens digit is 4, so the numbers would be 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place.\n\nFor the units place: The units digit is 4, and this can happen in every set of ten numbers. So from 10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99. In each of these sets, the units digit 4 appears once. There are 9 such sets (10-19 up to 90-99), so that's 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 times.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit pages: from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because now we have hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit 4 will only go up to 488, not 499. So, we need to be careful with the hundreds digit 4.\n\nBut wait, actually, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for each of these, we can count how many times 4 appears in each place.\n\nLet me separate this into hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\n1. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, for the tens digit being 4 in three-digit numbers. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 100-199, the tens digit 4 occurs in 140-149, which is 10 times. Similarly, in 200-299, it's 240-249, another 10 times. In 300-399, it's 340-349, another 10 times. And in 400-488, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but hold on, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, right? So, that's correct.\n\n3. Units place: Similarly, for the units digit being 4 in three-digit numbers. In each hundred, the units digit 4 occurs once every ten numbers. So, in 100-199, it's 104, 114, 124, ..., 194. That's 10 times. Similarly, in 200-299, it's 204, 214, ..., 294, another 10 times. In 300-399, it's 304, 314, ..., 394, another 10 times. In 400-488, it's 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, let's count that. From 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs at 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times because 484 is the last one before 488. Wait, but 484 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 9 times in the units place for the 400-488 range.\n\nWait, but in the previous hundreds, like 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has 10 occurrences. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 100-199: 104, 114, 124, 134, 144, 154, 164, 174, 184, 194: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 200-299: 204, ..., 294: 10 numbers. 300-399: 304, ..., 394: 10 numbers. Now, 400-488: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. So, yes, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total units place 4's in three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as for each hundred, the units digit cycles 1-10, so 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, for 100-199: 10 numbers. 200-299: 10, 300-399:10, 400-488: from 400 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see: 400-488 is 89 numbers. The units digit cycles every 10, so 89 / 10 = 8 full cycles, each contributing 1 occurrence, so 8, and then the remaining 9 numbers (480-488) would have 484 as the next occurrence. So, total 8 + 1 = 9. So, yes, 9 in 400-488. So, total 39 in units place.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times (from 400-488)\n- Tens place: 40 times\n- Units place: 39 times\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Single-digit: 1, two-digit: 19, three-digit: 168. So, 1 + 19 is 20, plus 168 is 188. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nAgain, I'll break it down into single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nSingle-digit: from 1-9. The only single-digit number with an 8 is page 8. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: from 10-99.\n\nFor the tens place: The tens digit is 8, so numbers 80-89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nFor the units place: The units digit is 8, which occurs once in each ten numbers. So, from 10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99. That's 9 sets, each contributing one 8, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, the digit 8 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times.\n\nThree-digit numbers: from 100-488.\n\nAgain, let's check hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\n1. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8? Wait, no, because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place in three-digit numbers here. So, 0 occurrences.\n\n2. Tens place: The tens digit is 8. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 8 occurs in 80-89, but in three-digit numbers, it's 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count each:\n\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last)\n\nSo, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9, so yes, 39.\n\n3. Units place: The units digit is 8. Again, in each hundred, the units digit 8 occurs once every 10 numbers. So:\n\n- 100-199: 108, 118, ..., 198: 10 times\n- 200-299: 208, 218, ..., 298: 10 times\n- 300-399: 308, 318, ..., 398: 10 times\n- 400-488: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488: 9 times (since 488 is included)\n\nSo, total units place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, but let me check the 400-488 range for units digit 8. From 400-488, the units digit 8 occurs at 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, the digit 8 appears:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 39\n- Units place: 39\nTotal: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that: 1 + 19 is 20, plus 78 is 98. Yes.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98.\n\nThe question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1 (correct)\n- Two-digit: 10 (tens place) + 9 (units) = 19 (correct)\n- Three-digit: hundreds place 89, tens 40, units 39. 89+40=129, +39=168. 1+19+168=188. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 10 + 9 = 19\n- Three-digit: tens 39, units 39. 39+39=78. 1+19+78=98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the three-digit numbers, especially the units place for 4's. I had 10 in 100-199, 10 in 200-299, 10 in 300-399, and 9 in 400-488, totaling 39. That seems correct because 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488, so only 9 in the last set.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in three-digit numbers, the tens place: 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first three contributes 10, and the last contributes 9, totaling 39. Units place: same logic, 10 in each hundred except the last, which has 9, so 39.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 4, so 1 occurrence.\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 40-49 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: 4 appears once in each ten (14, 24, ..., 94) \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total in two-digit: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n     - Tens place: 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 10 each, totaling 40.\n     - Units place: 104, 114, ..., 194; 204, ..., 294; 304, ..., 394; 404, 414, ..., 484 \u2192 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n     - Total in three-digit: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n   - **Total '4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 8, so 1 occurrence.\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 80-89 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: 8 appears once in each ten (18, 28, ..., 98) \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total in two-digit: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Tens place: 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 10 each for first three, 9 for last \u2192 39.\n     - Units place: 108, 118, ..., 198; 208, ..., 298; 308, ..., 398; 408, 418, ..., 488 \u2192 10 each for first three, 9 for last \u2192 39.\n     - Total in three-digit: 39 + 39 = 78.\n   - **Total '8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' appears 90 times more than the digit '8' in the page numbers.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in each of these ranges and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are. That makes sense. \n\nLet me start with the single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears exactly once, on page 4. Similarly, the digit 8 also appears once, on page 8. So, in single-digit pages, both 4 and 8 appear once each. That means the count for both is equal here, so no difference yet.\n\nNext, I'll move on to the two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Now, in two-digit numbers, digits can appear in the tens place or the units place. I should count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each position separately.\n\nStarting with the tens place for two-digit numbers. The tens digit can be from 1 to 9, and for each tens digit, there are 10 possible units digits (0-9). So, for the tens place, the digit 4 appears in the numbers 40-49. That's 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the numbers 80-89, which is also 10 times. So, in the tens place, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times each.\n\nNow, looking at the units place for two-digit numbers. For each group of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group, the digit 4 appears once (e.g., 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8 (e.g., 18, 28, etc.). There are 9 such groups (10-19 up to 90-99). Therefore, the digit 4 appears 9 times in the units place, and the same for 8. \n\nWait, hold on, actually, from 10-99, there are 90 numbers, which is 9 groups of 10. So, for each digit in the units place, it appears 9 times. So, yes, 9 times for 4 and 9 times for 8 in the units place.\n\nAdding up the counts for two-digit numbers: in the tens place, 10 each, and in the units place, 9 each. So total for two-digit numbers, 4 appears 10 + 9 = 19 times, and 8 also appears 19 times. So again, equal counts in two-digit numbers.\n\nSo, so far, in single and two-digit pages, both 4 and 8 have appeared 1 + 19 = 20 times each. So, no difference yet.\n\nNow, moving on to the three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because now we have hundreds, tens, and units places. Let me break it down by each digit position.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, for the hundreds place:\n\n- When the hundreds digit is 1, the numbers range from 100 to 199. In this range, how many times does 4 appear? Well, 4 doesn't appear in the hundreds place here. Similarly, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place here either.\n\n- When the hundreds digit is 2, the numbers are 200-299. Again, neither 4 nor 8 appears in the hundreds place here.\n\n- When the hundreds digit is 3, the numbers are 300-399. Same thing, 4 and 8 don't appear in the hundreds place.\n\n- When the hundreds digit is 4, the numbers are 400-488. Here, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? Let's see, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place here because the hundreds digit is always 4.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be from 0 to 9, and the units digit can also be from 0 to 9. Let's consider each possible hundreds digit and see how often 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nFirst, hundreds digit is 1 (100-199). The tens digit can be 0-9, and for each tens digit, there are 10 units digits. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? It appears in 140-149, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in 180-189, which is 10 times.\n\nSame goes for hundreds digit 2 (200-299): tens digit 4 appears in 240-249 (10 times), and 8 appears in 280-289 (10 times).\n\nFor hundreds digit 3 (300-399): tens digit 4 appears in 340-349 (10 times), and 8 appears in 380-389 (10 times).\n\nNow, for hundreds digit 4 (400-488). Here, the tens digit can go from 0 to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, let's see:\n\n- When the tens digit is 4, the numbers are 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\n- When the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-488. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so how many numbers are there from 480-488? Let's calculate: 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, meaning the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n\nWait, but I thought for hundreds digit 4, the tens digit can go up to 8. So, for tens digit 8, the numbers are 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, adding up for the tens place across all hundreds digits:\n\n- Hundreds 1: 10 each for 4 and 8.\n\n- Hundreds 2: 10 each.\n\n- Hundreds 3: 10 each.\n\n- Hundreds 4: 10 for 4, 9 for 8.\n\nSo, total for the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 for 4, and 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 for 8.\n\nWait, let me check that again. For hundreds 1, 2, 3, each contributes 10 for both 4 and 8 in the tens place. That's 3*10=30 each. Then, for hundreds 4, 4 contributes 10 for 4 and 9 for 8. So total for 4 in tens place: 30 + 10 = 40, and for 8: 30 + 9 = 39. So, yes, 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times in the tens place across all three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, considering each hundreds digit and the possible tens digits.\n\nFor units digit 4: in each group of ten numbers, the units digit cycles from 0-9, so 4 appears once every ten numbers. Similarly, 8 appears once every ten numbers.\n\nLet's break it down by hundreds digit:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1 (100-199): For each tens group (10-19, 20-29, etc.), 4 appears once in the units place. There are 10 tens groups (0-9), so 10 times for 4. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the units place.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2 (200-299): Same as above, 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3 (300-399): Again, 10 times each.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4 (400-488): Now, here, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, but the units digit still cycles 0-9 for each tens group. However, the last group is 480-488, which only goes up to 8. Wait, no, actually, in the units place, each tens group still goes from 0-9, but in the case of 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the last group is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so units digits 0-8. Hmm, but wait, in the units place, for each tens group, regardless of the hundreds digit, the units digit cycles through 0-9 unless restricted by the total number of pages.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to be careful here. Let me think.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4, the page numbers go up to 488. So, the three-digit numbers are from 400 to 488. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, the units digit can go from 0 to 9, except when the tens digit is 8, where the units digit only goes up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). \n\nWait, no, actually, the tens digit is 8 only for 480-488. So, for tens digits 0-7, the units digits go from 0-9, which is 10 numbers each. For tens digit 8, units digits go from 0-8, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, for the units place in hundreds digit 4:\n\n- For tens digits 0-7: each has 10 units digits, so 4 appears once per tens group, so 8 tens groups (0-7) * 1 = 8 times for 4.\n\n- For tens digit 8: units digits 0-8, so 4 appears once if 4 is within 0-8, which it is. So, 4 appears once here.\n\nWait, but wait, the units digit for 480-488 is 0-8. So, 484 is included, so 4 appears once in the units place for tens digit 8.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place:\n\n- For tens digits 0-7: each has 10 units digits, so 8 appears once per tens group, so 8 times.\n\n- For tens digit 8: units digits 0-8, so 8 appears once (at 488).\n\nSo, total for 4 in units place for hundreds digit 4: 8 (from tens 0-7) + 1 (from tens 8) = 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in units place: 8 (from tens 0-7) + 1 (from tens 8) = 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. For hundreds digit 4:\n\n- Tens digits 0-7: each has 10 units digits, so 4 appears once in each, so 8 times.\n\n- Tens digit 8: units digits 0-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo, yes, 4 appears 8 + 1 = 9 times in the units place for hundreds digit 4, and 8 appears 8 + 1 = 9 times as well.\n\nTherefore, for the units place across all hundreds digits:\n\n- Hundreds 1, 2, 3: each contributes 10 times for both 4 and 8.\n\n- Hundreds 4: contributes 9 times for both 4 and 8.\n\nSo, total for units place:\n\n- 4: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\n- 8: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, but hold on, that can't be right because earlier, in the tens place, 4 had 40 and 8 had 39. So, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, let me think again. For units place, in hundreds digits 1,2,3, each has 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8. So, 3*10=30 each. Then, for hundreds digit 4, units place: 9 times for 4 and 9 times for 8. So, total for 4: 30 + 9 = 39, and for 8: 30 + 9 = 39. So, yes, both 4 and 8 appear 39 times in the units place across all three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but earlier, in the tens place, 4 had 40 and 8 had 39. So, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the counts for three-digit numbers.\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\n- Units place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 times.\n\n- 8: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 times.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check the calculations again.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, correct.\n\nTens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nUnits place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\nFor 4: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 89 + 40 = 129, plus 39 is 168. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78. That's correct.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, 4 appears 168 times, and 8 appears 78 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the counts from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nSingle-digit:\n\n- 4: 1\n\n- 8: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- 4: 19\n\n- 8: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- 4: 168\n\n- 8: 78\n\nTotal:\n\n- 4: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\n- 8: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nSo, total number of 4's printed is 188, and total number of 8's is 98.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188 - 98 = 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with single-digit: both 4 and 8 appear once. Correct.\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place: 10 each.\n\n- Units place: 9 each.\n\nTotal: 19 each. Correct.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0.\n\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40, 8 appears 39.\n\n- Units place: 4 appears 39, 8 appears 39.\n\nTotal for 4: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nTotal for 8: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nAdding up all digits:\n\n4: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n8: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out the difference. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4). In 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. \n\nNow, how many such sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, I think we have 48 full sets and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). So, in each of the 48 full sets, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. That's 48 times. \n\nBut wait, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, does the digit 4 appear in the units place here? Yes, at page 484. So that's one more occurrence. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for every block of 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Then, this pattern repeats every 100 numbers. \n\nHow many full hundreds are there in 488? Well, 400-488 is the last partial hundred. Let's see: from 1-99, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 times. From 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10 times. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's another 10. \n\nWait, but hold on, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 times. But from 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and then 480-488 would have 480-488, but the tens digit here is 8, not 4. So, actually, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears only in 440-449, which is 10 times. \n\nSo, let me count: 1-99: 10 times, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:10. Wait, that's 5 sets of 10 each, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, 400-488 is only 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89), but the tens digit 4 only appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's okay. So, total tens place 4's are 50.\n\nWait, but let me check: 1-99: 40-49:10, 100-199:140-149:10, 200-299:240-249:10, 300-399:340-349:10, 400-488:440-449:10. So yes, that's 5*10=50. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Hmm, that seems high. Let me check my math again.\n\nWait, units place: 48 full sets of 10, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the extra 8 pages where 484 is included, so 48+1=49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10, and there are 4 full hundreds (1-400), but wait, 1-99 is the first hundred, 100-199 second, 200-299 third, 300-399 fourth, and 400-488 is the fifth partial hundred. So, 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. So, total 49+50+89=188. Hmm, that's a lot, but maybe it's correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with units place: Similar to 4, in each set of 10, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 48 full sets of 10, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the last partial set 481-488, which includes 488, so that's one more. So, units place 8's: 48+1=49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, each hundred contributes 10 times, except maybe the last one.\n\nFrom 1-99: 80-89:10, 100-199:180-189:10, 200-299:280-289:10, 300-399:380-389:10, 400-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 488-480+1=9). Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, right? Because 488-480=8, so 8+1=9. So, in the last partial hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4 full hundreds (1-399) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus the last partial hundred contributing 9. So, 40+9=49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 1-99:10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, that's 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place 8's:49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's:0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8. From 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. The difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but that seems like a big difference. Let me check my counting again.\n\nWait, for the 4's: units place 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor the 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nFor the tens place in 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 full sets of 10 (1-480), each contributing 1, so 48, plus 484 in 481-488, so 49. Correct.\n\nFor 8's: units place 49, correct. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each of the first four is 10, last is 9, so 4*10+9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot. Let me think differently. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a different approach to verify.\n\nAnother way to calculate the number of times a digit appears in a certain position is:\n\nFor units digit: total numbers / 10.\n\nFor tens digit: total numbers / 100 * 10.\n\nFor hundreds digit: total numbers / 1000 * 100, but adjusted for the actual range.\n\nWait, but maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, let's consider each digit place separately.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place: For each 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, total units 4's = floor(488/10) + (if the last partial set includes 4, add 1). Wait, floor(488/10)=48, and 488 mod 10=8, which is less than 4? No, 8 is greater than 4, so we have an extra 4 in the units place at 484. So, units 4's=48+1=49.\n\nTens place: For each 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, total tens 4's = floor(488/100)*10 + (if the last partial hundred has tens digit >=4, add the count). Wait, floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. Now, the last partial hundred is 400-488. In this range, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, add 10. So, total tens 4's=40+10=50.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's=49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly for 8's:\n\nUnits place: floor(488/10)=48, and 488 mod 10=8, which is equal to 8, so units 8's=48+1=49.\n\nTens place: floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. The last partial hundred is 400-488. The tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens 8's=40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: As before, 0.\n\nSo, total 8's=49+49=98.\n\nThus, difference=188-98=90.\n\nWait, so that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, I just thought of something. When counting the tens place for 8's, from 400-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, 488 is included, so that's why units 8's are 49.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many such blocks are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, we'll take 48 full blocks and then handle the remaining 8 pages (481-488). \n\nSo, in each of these 48 blocks, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484). So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, in each block of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each hundred, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place, so 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. Let's see: 401-409: tens digit is 0, 410-419: tens digit is 1, ..., 440-449: tens digit is 4. So, from 401-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's 10 times. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, inclusive. So, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 49 units, 50 tens, 89 hundreds. 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems correct. So, 188 4's.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: For every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full tens are there? 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place: In each block of 100, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. Let's see: 401-409: tens 0, 410-419: tens 1, ..., 480-489: tens 8. But since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nTherefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, so number of 4's is 188, and number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full decades (1-480) give 48 4's. Then, 481-488: 484 is the only one, so 1 more, total 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 4's in the tens place. 4 hundreds (1-400) give 40. Then, 401-488: 440-449 is 10, so total 50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each has a 4 in hundreds place. So, 89. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full decades, each with one 8, so 48. Then, 488 is the 8th in the last partial decade, so 1 more. Total 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, 9. Total 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a big difference. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: for each digit place, count the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) = 48, plus if the last digit is >=4, add 1. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly for 8's: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488 mod10 >=8, add 1, so 48+1=49.\n\nFor the tens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)=4, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, the remaining pages are 488 - 400 =88. So, in the tens place, how many 4's are there? The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 10. So total 40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly for 8's: floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. Remaining pages: 488-400=88. The tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the end). So, 40+9=49.\n\nFor the hundreds digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/1000)=0, but since 400-488 is within 400-999, the hundreds digit is 4 for 488-400+1=89 numbers.\n\nNumber of 8's: hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, which is beyond 488, so 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, so I think that's correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full decades (1-480) give 48 occurrences. The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add 1 more, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences, so 4 hundreds give 40. The remaining pages (401-488) add 10 more, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 contribute 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full decades give 48 occurrences. The remaining 8 pages add 1 more, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences, so 4 hundreds give 40. The remaining pages add 9 more, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the first thing I should do is count how many times the digit 4 appears in each of these ranges and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have the counts for both digits, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering the single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears exactly once, on page 4. Similarly, the digit 8 also appears once, on page 8. So, in the single-digit pages, both digits 4 and 8 appear once each. That means the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, I'll move on to the two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should count the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each of these places separately.\n\nStarting with the tens place for two-digit numbers: For the digit 4 in the tens place, the numbers would be 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place, the numbers would be 80-89, which is another 10 numbers, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers: The digit 4 can appear in the units place for each set of ten, like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 times, but wait, when we get to 44, the digit 4 appears twice, but I think I'm only counting the units place here, so it's still 9 times. Similarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, the numbers would be 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. Again, that's 9 times, with 88 having two 8's, but I'm only considering the units place, so it's 9 times.\n\nWait, no, actually, I think I made a mistake here. Let me correct that. For each ten's group, like 10-19, 20-29, etc., the units digit cycles through 0-9. So for each ten's group, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 ten's groups from 10-99, so 9 times for 4 in the units place. Similarly, for 8 in the units place, it's also 9 times. But wait, when we reach 40-49, the units digit still goes from 0-9, so 44 would have two 4's, but in the units place, it's just one occurrence. So, I think my initial count is correct: 9 times for each digit in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 10-99, there are 90 numbers. Each digit in the units place appears 9 times for each digit from 0-9, except that 0 appears 9 times as well, but in the units place, 0 isn't counted as a digit, right? Wait, no, 0 does appear in the units place, but in page numbers, 0 isn't used except in the tens place for numbers like 10, 20, etc. But when considering digits, 0 is a digit, but in the context of counting digits printed, 0 doesn't count as a digit we're interested in here, but for the count of 4 and 8, we should consider how often they appear in the units and tens places.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49) and 9 times in the units place (14,24,...,94). So total for 4 is 10 + 9 = 19 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8, it's 10 times in the tens place (80-89) and 9 times in the units place (18,28,...,98). So total for 8 is 10 + 9 = 19 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in the units place, 4 appears 9 times, but in reality, from 10-99, each units digit from 0-9 appears exactly 9 times, except for the tens digit, which is fixed for each group. So, yes, 4 appears 9 times in the units place, and 8 also appears 9 times. So total for two-digit numbers, 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times, and 8 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. So, in two-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each, so the difference is still zero.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because each page number now has a hundreds place, a tens place, and a units place. So, I need to consider each place separately for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, pages 100-199 have 1 in the hundreds place, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place, how many times does 4 appear? It's from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in the range 100-488, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place in the three-digit numbers. The tens digit can range from 0-9, and for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each ten. So, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. Wait, no, for each hundred, there are 100 numbers, so for each ten's group, like 100-109, 110-119, etc., the tens digit is fixed for each group. So, for each hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, for the digit 4 in the tens place: In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). But wait, in the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, that's 4 hundreds, but wait, 400-488 is only part of the fourth hundred. So, in 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0-8, so 440-449 is included, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in 400-488 as well.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit still cycles through 0-8, so each digit from 0-8 appears 10 times in the tens place, right? Because 400-409 is 10 numbers, 410-419 is another 10, and so on up to 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, actually, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 pages, but the tens digit in 400-488 goes from 0-8, but for tens digit 8, the units digit only goes up to 8, making it 9 numbers instead of 10. Hmm, this complicates things a bit.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. For each hundred, except the last one, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, so each digit appears 10 times. But in the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0-8, and for each tens digit, except 8, it's 10 numbers. For tens digit 8, it's only 9 numbers (480-488). So, for the digit 4 in the tens place in 400-488, it's 10 numbers (440-449). So, in each of the first three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. In the last hundred (400-488), it's also 10 times because 440-449 is within 400-488. So, total for the tens place across all three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds 100-199: 10 times\n- Hundreds 200-299: 10 times\n- Hundreds 300-399: 10 times\n- Hundreds 400-488: 10 times\nTotal: 40 times for 4 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place: In each hundred except the last, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, 380-389). In the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the first three hundreds, 10 times each, and in the last hundred, 9 times. So total for 8 in the tens place: 3*10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. For 100-199, the tens digit 8 is from 180-189: 10 numbers. Similarly, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10. In 400-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488: that's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So yes, 3*10 + 9 = 39 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in the three-digit numbers. The units digit cycles through 0-9 for each tens group. So, for each hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the units place, except in the last hundred where the units digit might be cut short if the last page doesn't complete the full ten.\n\nWait, in the last hundred, 400-488, the units digit for each tens group from 400-479 would go up to 9, but for the tens group 480-488, the units digit only goes up to 8. So, in the units place for 400-488, digits 0-8 appear 10 times each, except for 9, which appears 9 times. Wait, no, actually, for each tens group, the units digit cycles through 0-9, but in 480-488, the units digit only goes up to 8, so for the tens group 480-488, the units digits are 0-8, which is 9 numbers. So, for each hundred except the last, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the units place. In the last hundred, digits 0-8 appear 10 times each, and digit 9 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, no, let me correct that. For each hundred, like 100-199, each tens group (100-109, 110-119, etc.) has 10 numbers, so each units digit 0-9 appears exactly 10 times per hundred. But in the last hundred, 400-488, the tens group 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so the units digits go from 0-8, which is 9 digits. So, for the units place in 400-488, each digit from 0-8 appears 9 times, and digit 9 appears 9 times as well because the last page is 488, which doesn't include 489-499. Wait, no, 488 is the last page, so the units digits in 480-488 are 0-8, which is 9 digits, each appearing once. So, for each tens group in 400-488, the units digits are 0-8, except for the last tens group, which is only 480-488, so units digits 0-8, each appearing once.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the units digits separately for each hundred.\n\nFor hundreds 100-199, 200-299, and 300-399: Each has 100 numbers, so each digit 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the units place. So, for each of these hundreds, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the units place, and the digit 8 appears 10 times as well.\n\nFor the last hundred, 400-488: There are 89 numbers. The units digits here: For each tens group from 400-479, each tens group has 10 numbers, so units digits 0-9 appear 10 times each. But the last tens group is 480-488, which has 9 numbers, so units digits 0-8 appear once each, and 9 doesn't appear. So, in the units place for 400-488:\n\n- Digits 0-8: Each appears 10 times (from 400-479) plus 1 time in 480-488, so 11 times each? Wait, no, that's not correct because in 400-479, each units digit 0-9 appears 10 times across the 10 tens groups (400-409, 410-419, etc.), so each digit appears 10 times. Then, in 480-488, units digits 0-8 each appear once. So, total for units digits in 400-488:\n\n- For digits 0-8: 10 (from 400-479) + 1 (from 480-488) = 11 times each.\n- For digit 9: Only appears 10 times in 400-479, and doesn't appear in 480-488, so 10 times.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 400-488 is 89 numbers, and 11 times each for digits 0-8 would be 9 digits * 11 = 99, plus 10 times for 9, which would be 109, but 89 is less than 100. Hmm, I think I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me try a different approach. For the units place in 400-488:\n\n- From 400-479: There are 80 numbers, which is 8 tens groups (400-409 to 470-479). Each tens group has 10 numbers, so each units digit 0-9 appears exactly 8 times in the units place? Wait, no, because each tens group contributes one occurrence of each units digit. So, 8 tens groups mean each units digit appears 8 times in the units place from 400-479.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Each tens group (like 400-409) has 10 numbers, so each units digit 0-9 appears once in each tens group. Since there are 8 tens groups from 400-479, each units digit appears 8 times in the units place from 400-479.\n\nThen, from 480-488: There are 9 numbers, so units digits 0-8 each appear once, and 9 doesn't appear. So, for units digits:\n\n- Digits 0-8: 8 times from 400-479 + 1 time from 480-488 = 9 times each.\n- Digit 9: Only 8 times from 400-479, as it doesn't appear in 480-488.\n\nWait, but 400-479 is 80 numbers, which is 8 tens groups (400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479). Each tens group has 10 numbers, so each units digit appears 8 times in the units place from 400-479. Then, in 480-488, each units digit from 0-8 appears once, so total for units digits:\n\n- 0-8: 8 + 1 = 9 times each.\n- 9: 8 times.\n\nSo, for the digit 4 in the units place in 400-488: 9 times.\nFor the digit 8 in the units place in 400-488: 9 times.\n\nBut wait, in 400-488, the units digit 4 appears 9 times, and 8 appears 9 times as well.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in 400-479, each units digit appears 8 times, and in 480-488, each units digit 0-8 appears once, so total 9 times each. So, yes, both 4 and 8 appear 9 times in the units place in 400-488.\n\nNow, combining this with the other hundreds:\n\n- For 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: Each has 10 occurrences of 4 and 8 in the units place.\n- For 400-488: 9 occurrences of 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\nSo, total for the units place across all three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4: 3 hundreds * 10 + 9 = 30 + 9 = 39 times.\n- 8: 3 hundreds * 10 + 9 = 30 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, but that seems contradictory because in 400-488, both 4 and 8 appear 9 times in the units place, but in the other hundreds, they each appear 10 times. So, total for 4 in units place: 3*10 + 9 = 39, and same for 8: 3*10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in the units place, for each hundred except the last, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times, and in the last hundred, they appear 9 times each. So, yes, 3*10 + 9 = 39 for both 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was considering the tens place, I had 40 times for 4 and 39 times for 8 in the tens place. Now, in the units place, both have 39 times. So, let me summarize:\n\nFor three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n  - 8 appears 0 times.\n- Tens place:\n  - 4 appears 40 times.\n  - 8 appears 39 times.\n- Units place:\n  - 4 appears 39 times.\n  - 8 appears 39 times.\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168 times.\n- 8: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. For the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times because pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, which is 89 pages. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all because the highest hundreds digit is 4.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears 40 times: 10 times in each of the first three hundreds and 10 times in the last hundred (440-449). For 8 in the tens place, it's 10 times in each of the first three hundreds, and 9 times in the last hundred (480-488), so 3*10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nIn the units place, 4 appears 39 times: 10 times in each of the first three hundreds and 9 times in the last hundred. Similarly, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n- 4: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n- 8: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, 4 appears 168 times and 8 appears 78 times.\n\nNow, let's add up the counts from all ranges:\n\n- Single-digit (1-9):\n  - 4: 1\n  - 8: 1\n- Two-digit (10-99):\n  - 4: 19\n  - 8: 19\n- Three-digit (100-488):\n  - 4: 168\n  - 8: 78\n\nTotal for 4: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\nTotal for 8: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems off because 188 - 98 = 90, but I think I might have made a mistake in the three-digit counts.\n\nWait, let me double-check the three-digit counts.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4: 89 times (from 400-488)\n- 8: 0 times\n\nTens place:\n- 4: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-449) = 40 times\n- 8: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (480-488) = 39 times\n\nUnits place:\n- 4: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times\n- 8: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n- 4: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n- 8: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nNow, adding single-digit and two-digit:\n\n- 4: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188\n- 8: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier that in the units place for three-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appeared 39 times each, but when I added up, it came to 39 each, which seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the counts again because 188 - 98 = 90 seems a bit high. Let me see:\n\nSingle-digit:\n- 4: 1\n- 8: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n- 4: 19\n- 8: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n- 4: 168\n- 8: 78\n\nAdding up:\n\n4: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n8: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit's occurrence in the units, tens, and hundreds places across all page ranges.\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - 8 appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units place:** Each digit appears 9 times (14, 24, ..., 94 for 4; 18, 28, ..., 98 for 8).\n   - **Total for two-digit:** 19 times each.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n   - **Total for three-digit:** 168 times for 4, 78 times for 8.\n\n**Total counts:**\n- **4's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n- **8's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each place for both 4 and 8 and sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's:\n\n1. Units place: For every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many such blocks are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks and then 8 extra numbers. Each block contributes 1 four in the units place, so that's 48 fours. Plus, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So total units place fours: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but actually, let me check that. For units place, from 1-488, each ten's place has exactly one 4 in the units. So from 1-480, that's 48 sets of ten, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours. Then from 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units. So total units fours: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, for the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of ten numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So how many such blocks are there up to 488?\n\nLet's see, the first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each contributes 10 fours, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nBut wait, 488 is the last page, so does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So yes, five blocks, each with 10 fours in the tens place. So that's 50 fours.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So how many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nSo total number of fours is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's:\n\n1. Units place: Similar to 4's, each block of ten numbers contributes one 8 in the units place. From 1-480, that's 48 blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. Then from 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 488 is the only one with an 8 in the units place. So total units eights: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So how many such blocks are there?\n\nFrom 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: which is 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, not 10). Wait, no, actually, from 480 to 489 would be 10 numbers, but our book stops at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So in the tens place, the digit 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last one contributes 9 eights because it only goes up to 488.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the tens place, the 8 is in the tens digit. So for example, 80-89: tens digit is 8 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, 180-189: tens digit is 8 for all 10, and so on. Now, for 480-488: the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, right? Because 480 is 4 8 0, 481 is 4 8 1, up to 488, which is 4 8 8. So the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers from 480 to 488. So each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights.\n\nSo total eights in the tens place: 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, there are zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of eights is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98 eights.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting.\n\nWait, when counting the tens place for 4's, I considered five blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50. That seems right.\n\nFor the units place of 4's, from 1-488, each ten contributes one 4, so 48 full tens, plus one more in 484, so 49. Correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place of 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct.\n\nFor the eights, units place: same as fours, 49. Tens place: four full blocks of ten (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 10 each, so 40, plus the 480-488 block contributing 9, totaling 49. So total eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nThus, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90 more fours. So the answer should be 90.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me recount the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours. Correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place of fours, five blocks each with 10 fours: 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, plus one more in 484, so 49. Correct.\n\nEights: Units place, same as fours, 49. Tens place: four blocks of 10, each contributing 10 eights, and one block of 9, so 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nSo total eights: 49 + 49 = 98. Fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the approach here is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each of these ranges and do the same for the digit 8, then subtract the two totals to find the difference. That makes sense. Let me start by counting the number of 4's first.\n\nStarting with single-digit pages (1-9). The only single-digit number with a 4 is page 4. So that's one 4. Now, moving on to two-digit pages (10-99). Here, 4 can appear in the tens place or the units place. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers from 40 to 49 all have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 pages, so 10 fours. \n\nFor the units place: The numbers 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, but I'm only counting the units place here. So from 10 to 99, in the units place, how many 4's are there? Let's see, every 10 numbers, there's a 4 in the units place. So from 10-19: 14, 20-29:24, 30-39:34, 40-49:44, 50-59:54, 60-69:64, 70-79:74, 80-89:84, 90-99:94. That's 9 instances. Wait, but 44 is included in both the tens and units place counts. But since I'm only counting the units place here, I think it's 9 times. Wait, no, from 10 to 99, that's 9 decades (10-19 up to 90-99), each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 9 fours. But wait, 40-49 is the tens place, so units place would be 44, which is one of those. So yeah, 9 fours in the units place for two-digit numbers.\n\nSo for two-digit numbers, the number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19.\n\nNow, for three-digit pages, which are from 100 to 488. Let's break this down further. The three-digit numbers can be thought of as having hundreds, tens, and units places. So, 4 can appear in the hundreds, tens, or units place. But since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But 4 in the hundreds place would only go up to 499, but since we stop at 488, the hundreds digit 4 only goes up to 488. Hmm, this might complicate things a bit, but let's proceed.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in the hundreds place. Pages 400 to 488 have 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive). Each of these contributes one 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. For the tens digit being 4, we have numbers like 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since we're only going up to 488, the last one would be 440-449. Let me check how many full decades that is. From 100 to 399, each hundred has a 40-49 in the tens place, so that's 3 sets of 10 numbers each, so 3*10=30 fours in the tens place from 100-399. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 fours. So total in the tens place for three-digit numbers is 30 +10=40 fours.\n\nWait, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's 10 pages. So 30 from 100-399 and 10 from 400-488, totaling 40 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. For each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9, so in each hundred, there are 10 numbers where the units digit is 4. So from 100-199: 104,114,...,194. That's 10 numbers. Similarly, 200-299: 204,214,...,294: 10 numbers. 300-399: 304,...,394: 10 numbers. And 400-488: 404,414,...,484. Wait, how many are there? From 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs every 10 numbers. So starting at 404, then 414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. Wait, let me count: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, right? Because 484 +10 would be 494, which is beyond 488. So, in the 400-488 range, units digit 4 occurs 9 times.\n\nSo total units digit 4's in three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) +10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+9 (400-488) = 39 fours.\n\nWait, but wait, in 400-488, units digit 4 occurs at 404,414,...,484, which is 9 numbers, as I thought. So 39 in total.\n\nSo, for three-digit numbers, the number of 4's is hundreds place:89, tens place:40, units place:39. So total 89+40+39=168 fours in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1+19=20, 20+168=188. So total 4's printed: 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's. Starting with single-digit pages (1-9). The only single-digit number with an 8 is page 8. So that's one 8.\n\nTwo-digit pages (10-99). 8 can appear in the tens place or the units place.\n\nTens place: 80-89, which is 10 pages, so 10 eights.\n\nUnits place: For each ten, like 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the units place. So 9 eights.\n\nSo, two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) +9 (units)=19 eights.\n\nNow, three-digit numbers (100-488). Let's break it down.\n\nHundreds place: Only 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: Let's see. In three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 8. So, for each hundred, the tens digit 8 occurs in 80-89 in that hundred. So from 100-199: 180-189, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 200-299:280-289:10, 300-399:380-389:10, and 400-488:480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, 8's occur as:\n\n100-199:10\n200-299:10\n300-399:10\n400-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers)\n\nSo total tens place 8's:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nUnits place: For each hundred, the units digit 8 occurs every 10 numbers. So from 100-199: 108,118,...,198:10 numbers. Similarly, 200-299:208,...,298:10, 300-399:308,...,398:10, and 400-488:408,418,...,488. Wait, 488 is included, so how many are there? Let's see, starting at 408, each 10 numbers:408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so 488 is included, making it 9 instances.\n\nSo units place 8's:10 (100-199)+10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+9 (400-488)=39.\n\nSo, for three-digit numbers, the number of 8's is tens place:39 + units place:39=78 eights.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) =1+19=20, 20+78=98. So total 8's printed:98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1 (correct).\n\nTwo-digit: tens place 40-49:10 fours. Units place:14,24,...,94:9 fours. So 10+9=19 (correct).\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place:400-488:89 pages, so 89 fours (correct).\n\nTens place:140-149,240-249,340-349:3*10=30. Plus 440-449:10. So 40 fours (correct).\n\nUnits place:104,114,...,194:10; 204,...,294:10;304,...,394:10;404,...,484:9. So 10+10+10+9=39 (correct).\n\nTotal three-digit fours:89+40+39=168 (correct).\n\nTotal 4's:1+19+168=188 (correct).\n\nNow for 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1 (correct).\n\nTwo-digit:80-89:10, units place:18,28,...,98:9. So 19 (correct).\n\nThree-digit:\n\nTens place:180-189,280-289,380-389:3*10=30; 480-488:9. So 39 (correct).\n\nUnits place:108,...,198:10;208,...,298:10;308,...,398:10;408,...,488:9. So 10+10+10+9=39 (correct).\n\nTotal three-digit 8's:39+39=78 (correct).\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98 (correct).\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I calculated the units place for three-digit numbers for 4's, I had 39, and for 8's, also 39. That seems consistent. But let me check if in the three-digit numbers, the units digit 8 in 400-488 is indeed 9. From 408,418,...,488: that's 9 numbers because 408 is the first, then adding 10 each time up to 488. So 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488: yes, 9 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place in three-digit 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers:480,481,...,488. But wait, in the tens place, we're only considering the tens digit being 8, so 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So that's correct.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the calculations are correct. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check the three-digit hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 +1 =89. So that's correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place in three-digit 4's, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked all parts. So the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit page numbers.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - Only one 4: page 4.\n   - Total: 1\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** Pages 40-49 (10 numbers).\n   - **Units place:** Pages 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94 (9 numbers).\n   - Total: 10 + 9 = 19\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 (89 numbers).\n   - **Tens place:** Pages 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 (30 + 10 = 40).\n   - **Units place:** Pages 104, 114, ..., 194, 204, ..., 294, 304, ..., 394, 404, ..., 484 (10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39).\n   - Total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n\n**Total 4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - Only one 8: page 8.\n   - Total: 1\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** Pages 80-89 (10 numbers).\n   - **Units place:** Pages 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98 (9 numbers).\n   - Total: 10 + 9 = 19\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488.\n   - **Tens place:** Pages 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 (10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39).\n   - **Units place:** Pages 108, 118, ..., 198, 208, ..., 298, 308, ..., 398, 408, ..., 488 (10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39).\n   - Total: 39 + 39 = 78\n\n**Total 8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the first thing I need to do is count how many times the digit 4 appears in each of these ranges and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I think that's a good approach because each position contributes independently to the count of digits.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the single-digit numbers (1-9), the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once. So, in the units place, both digits appear the same number of times here. But when we move to two-digit numbers, the units place cycles every 10 numbers. For example, from 10-19, the units digits are 0-9, so 4 appears once (at 14) and 8 appears once (at 18). This pattern continues for each set of ten. So, for two-digit numbers (10-99), how many sets of ten do we have? Well, 99 - 10 + 1 = 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of ten. So, in each set, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. Therefore, for two-digit numbers, the units place contributes 9 times for 4 and 9 times for 8.\n\nWait, but that doesn't sound right. Wait, no, actually, each set of ten contributes once for each digit. So, for each digit, in the units place, from 10-99, it's 9 times. So, for 4, that's 9 times in the units place, and same for 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. For three-digit numbers, the hundreds digit goes from 1 to 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. \n\nLet me calculate how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. \n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. \n\nNow, let's move to the tens place. For the tens place, I think we can consider each hundred separately. For example, in the 100-199 range, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 100 numbers. So, for each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 140-149), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 180-189). \n\nWait, but let me check. For each hundred, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well. \n\nNow, considering the hundreds from 100-399, that's three hundreds: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399. So, for each of these, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. So, 3 hundreds x 10 = 30 times for 4 and 30 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nBut wait, what about the last hundred, 400-488? Here, the hundreds digit is 4, so the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit cycles from 0-8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Let's see: 400-488 is 89 numbers. The tens digit cycles every 10 numbers, so 4 appears in the tens place for 440-449, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place for 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, meaning 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here. \n\nWait, but let me confirm. From 400 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit, there are 10 numbers except for the last one, which might be shorter. So, for tens digit 0: 400-409 (10 numbers), 1: 410-419 (10), 2: 420-429 (10), 3: 430-439 (10), 4: 440-449 (10), 5: 450-459 (10), 6: 460-469 (10), 7: 470-479 (10), and 8: 480-488 (9 numbers). So, yes, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in 400-488.\n\nSo, in the tens place, for 400-488, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times. \n\nTherefore, in the tens place overall, from 100-399, 4 appears 30 times, and 8 appears 30 times. Then, in 400-488, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times. So, total in the tens place: 4 appears 30 + 10 = 40 times, and 8 appears 30 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not double-counting. Because when I considered 100-399, I included all the tens digits, and then 400-488 adds more. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let me sum up all the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each digit position.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n- Single-digit numbers (1-9): 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\n- Two-digit numbers (10-99): For each ten, 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. There are 9 tens (10-99), so 9 times each.\n- Three-digit numbers (100-488): The units digit cycles 0-9 for each hundred. So, in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has 10 numbers where the units digit is 4 and 10 where it's 8. Then, in 400-488, the units digit goes from 0 to 8, so 4 appears 9 times (404, 414, ..., 484) and 8 appears 9 times (408, 418, ..., 488). Wait, but 488 is included, so from 400-488, the units digit for 4 is 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484: that's 9 times. Similarly, 8 appears at 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488: also 9 times.\n\nWait, but in 400-488, how many units digits are there? From 400 to 488, the units digits go from 0 to 8, but each ten has 10 units digits, except the last one which is 480-488, which is 9 units digits. Wait, no, actually, in each hundred, the units digits cycle through 0-9 for each ten. So, in 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digits go up to 8, but the units digits go up to 8 as well. So, for each ten in 400-488, the units digits go from 0-9 except for the last ten, which only goes up to 8. So, in 400-488, the units digits for 4 and 8 would be as follows:\n\nFor each ten from 400-409, 410-419, etc., up to 480-488, the units digit 4 appears once per ten, except maybe the last one. Wait, no, in each ten, the units digit 4 appears once, regardless of the tens digit. So, in 400-488, how many tens are there? From 400-409 (tens digit 0), 410-419 (tens 1), up to 480-488 (tens 8). So, that's 9 tens. In each of these, the units digit 4 appears once, so 9 times in total. Similarly, units digit 8 appears once per ten, so 9 times as well.\n\nWait, but in the last ten, 480-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, yes, 9 times each.\n\nSo, for the units place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-199: 10 times 4, 10 times 8.\n- 200-299: 10 times 4, 10 times 8.\n- 300-399: 10 times 4, 10 times 8.\n- 400-488: 9 times 4, 9 times 8.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n- 100-399: 3 x 10 = 30 times 4, 30 times 8.\n- 400-488: 9 times 4, 9 times 8.\nTotal units place: 30 + 9 = 39 times 4, 30 + 9 = 39 times 8.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought in two-digit numbers, the units place contributed 9 times each. Let me check that again.\n\nIn two-digit numbers (10-99), each ten contributes once for 4 and once for 8 in the units place. There are 9 tens (10-99), so 9 times each. So, units place:\n\n- Single-digit: 1 each.\n- Two-digit: 9 each.\n- Three-digit: 39 each.\n\nWait, that can't be right because in three-digit numbers, the units place is part of the hundreds and tens as well. Wait, no, I think I'm confusing units, tens, and hundreds. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, no, in the units place, for each page number, regardless of how many digits, the units digit is just the last digit. So, for 1-9, units digits are 1-9. For 10-99, units digits cycle 0-9 for each ten. For 100-488, units digits cycle 0-9 for each ten in each hundred.\n\nSo, perhaps a better way is to calculate the units digits across all page numbers.\n\nSo, for units digits:\n\n- Pages 1-9: units digits 1-9. So, 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\n- Pages 10-99: each ten contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. There are 9 tens (10-99), so 9 times each.\n- Pages 100-488: For each hundred, the units digits cycle 0-9 for each ten. So, in each hundred, 10 times 4 and 10 times 8. There are four hundreds: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, 400-488 is not a full hundred, it's 89 pages. So, in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has 90 pages, so 9 tens, each contributing 10 units digits. So, in each of these, 10 times 4 and 10 times 8. So, 3 x 10 = 30 times each. Then, in 400-488, which is 89 pages, how many times do 4 and 8 appear in the units place? Well, in each ten, the units digit cycles 0-9, so in 400-488, the tens digits go up to 8, so the units digits go up to 8 as well. So, in each ten, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. There are 9 tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488). In each ten, 4 appears once in the units place, so 9 times. Similarly, 8 appears once per ten, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total units digits:\n\n- 1-9: 1 each.\n- 10-99: 9 each.\n- 100-199: 10 each.\n- 200-299: 10 each.\n- 300-399: 10 each.\n- 400-488: 9 each.\n\nAdding these up:\n\nFor 4: 1 (1-9) + 9 (10-99) + 10 +10 +10 (100-399) +9 (400-488) = 1 +9=10, 10+10+10=30, 30+9=39. So, 39 times 4 in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8: 1 +9 +10+10+10 +9 = same as above, 39 times.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 39 times each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nFor the tens place, we need to consider each hundred and how many times 4 and 8 appear there.\n\n- Pages 1-9: There's no tens digit, so 0 times.\n- Pages 10-99: The tens digit cycles from 1-9. For each ten, the tens digit is the same for all 10 numbers. So, in 10-19, tens digit is 1; 20-29, tens digit is 2, etc. So, 4 appears once in the tens place (40-49), which is 10 times, and 8 appears once in the tens place (80-89), which is 10 times.\n- Pages 100-488: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 for each hundred. So, in 100-199, the tens digit 4 appears in 140-149, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 180-189, which is 10 times. Similarly, in 200-299, 240-249 (10 times) and 280-289 (10 times). Same for 300-399: 340-349 (10 times) and 380-389 (10 times). Now, for 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nSo, let's break it down:\n\n- 10-99: 10 times 4, 10 times 8.\n- 100-199: 10 times 4, 10 times 8.\n- 200-299: 10 times 4, 10 times 8.\n- 300-399: 10 times 4, 10 times 8.\n- 400-488: 10 times 4 (440-449), 9 times 8 (480-488).\n\nSo, adding these up:\n\nFor 4 in tens place:\n\n- 10 (10-99) +10 +10 +10 (100-399) +10 (400-488) = 10+10+10+10+10=50 times.\n\nFor 8 in tens place:\n\n- 10 (10-99) +10 +10 +10 (100-399) +9 (400-488) = 10+10+10+10+9=49 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\n- Pages 1-99: No hundreds digit, so 0 times.\n- Pages 100-199: Hundreds digit is 1, so 4 and 8 don't appear here.\n- Pages 200-299: Hundreds digit is 2, same thing.\n- Pages 300-399: Hundreds digit is 3.\n- Pages 400-488: Hundreds digit is 4.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears in pages 400-488. How many times? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with hundreds digit 4. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 4: 89 times\n- 8: 0 times\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences of 4 and 8 across units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nFor 4:\n\n- Units place: 39\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 39 + 50 + 89 = 178 times.\n\nFor 8:\n\n- Units place: 39\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 39 + 49 + 0 = 88 times.\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 178, and the number of 8's is 88. The difference is 178 - 88 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- 1-9: 1 each\n- 10-99: 9 each\n- 100-199: 10 each\n- 200-299: 10 each\n- 300-399: 10 each\n- 400-488: 9 each\nTotal for 4: 1 +9 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 39\nSame for 8: 39\n\nTens place:\n\n- 10-99: 10 each\n- 100-199: 10 each\n- 200-299: 10 each\n- 300-399: 10 each\n- 400-488: 10 for 4, 9 for 8\nTotal for 4: 10*4 +10 = 50\nTotal for 8: 10*4 +9 = 49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 400-488: 89 for 4\n- 8: 0\n\nAdding up:\n\n4: 39 +50 +89 = 178\n8: 39 +49 +0 = 88\n\nDifference: 178 -88 =90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 488 -400 +1 =89 pages, each with hundreds digit 4, so 89 times. That seems right.\n\nIn the tens place, for 400-488, I counted 10 times for 4 (440-449) and 9 times for 8 (480-488). That seems correct because 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place there.\n\nIn the units place, for 400-488, both 4 and 8 appear 9 times each in the units place, which I think is correct because each ten contributes once, and there are 9 tens.\n\nSo, yes, I think the calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is 178, and the digit 8 appears 88 times. The difference is 178 - 88 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the approach here is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. \n\nFirst, the single-digit pages: from 1 to 9. The digit 4 appears once here, which is on page 4. \n\nNext, the two-digit pages: from 10 to 99. I need to consider both the tens place and the units place. \n\nIn the tens place, the digit 4 appears from 40 to 49. That's 10 pages. So, that's 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. \n\nIn the units place, the digit 4 appears once every ten numbers, like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but since we're only going up to 99, that's 9 occurrences. But wait, from 10 to 99, that's 9 decades, so 9 times, but in each decade, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so the 4 appears once per decade. So that's 9 times. But wait, from 10 to 99, how many two-digit numbers have 4 in the units place? Let me count: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. But wait, 44 has two 4's, so does that count as two? Hmm, no, I think I'm counting the number of times 4 appears in the units place, regardless of how many digits are in the number. So each of these numbers contributes one 4 in the units place, so 9 times.\n\nWait, but from 10 to 99, that's 90 numbers, and for each ten's place, the units digit cycles 0-9. So for each ten's place (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the units digit 4 appears once. There are 9 ten's places (1-9), so 9 times. So, 9 occurrences of 4 in the units place for two-digit numbers.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, total 4's are 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit pages: from 100 to 488.\n\nFirst, let's break it down into hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nIn the hundreds place: The three-digit numbers go from 100 to 488. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears from 400 to 488. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place: For three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be from 0 to 9, and the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. We need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nFor each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundreds group, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). \n\nBut wait, for the 400-488 group, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 400-488. So, in each of the hundreds groups 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. However, 400-488 only goes up to 488, but since 440-449 is within that range, it's 10 numbers. So, 4 times 10 is 40, but wait, 400-488 is a partial group. Wait, no, 400-488 is the hundreds group where hundreds digit is 4, and within that, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times as 440-449. So, for the three-digit numbers, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times in each hundreds group, and there are 4 hundreds groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 isn't a complete hundreds group; it only goes up to 488, but since 440-449 is within 400-488, the tens digit 4 still appears 10 times there. So, total tens digit 4's in three-digit numbers: 4 groups \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\nWait, but actually, from 100-999, each hundreds group has 100 numbers, so for the tens digit, 4 appears 10 times per hundreds group. But in our case, we only go up to 488, so the 400-488 group is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit 4 still appears 10 times in 440-449. So, yes, 40 times in total for the tens place in three-digit numbers.\n\nIn the units place: Similarly, for three-digit numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, for each hundreds group, the units digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. \n\nSo, for each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), how many times does the units digit 4 appear? \n\nIn 100-199: The units digit 4 appears in 104,114,124,...,194. That's 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, in 200-299: 204,214,...,294: 10 times.\n\nIn 300-399: 304,314,...,394: 10 times.\n\nIn 400-488: The units digit 4 appears in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Wait, but 484 is within 488, so that's 9 times? Wait, let me count: starting from 404, each 10 numbers, so 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the 9th occurrence (since 404 is the first, and each step is +10, so 404 + 10*8 = 484). So, that's 9 times.\n\nWait, but in 400-488, the units digit 4 appears 9 times because the last number with units digit 4 is 484, which is within 488. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total units digit 4's in three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 100-199, 10 times. 200-299, 10. 300-399, 10. 400-488, 9. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, the units digit 4 appears 39 times.\n\nWait, but let me think again. For each hundreds group, the units digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so for 100-199, that's 10 times. Similarly for 200-299 and 300-399. But for 400-488, how many times does the units digit 4 appear? The first occurrence is 404, then 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times because 484 is the last one before 488. So yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, total units digit 4's in three-digit numbers: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89+40=129+39=168.\n\nWait, but let me add that again: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) = 129, plus 39 (units) = 168.\n\nSo, total 4's in all page numbers: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1+19=20+168=188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check the three-digit numbers again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nIn the tens place, for three-digit numbers, each hundreds group (100-199, etc.) has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place, so 4 groups \u00d710=40.\n\nIn the units place, three-digit numbers: 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 39.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168.\n\nAdding single-digit and two-digit: 1+19=20. So total 4's: 20+168=188.\n\nHmm, okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nStarting with single-digit pages: 1-9. The digit 8 appears once, on page 8.\n\nTwo-digit pages: 10-99.\n\nIn the tens place: The digit 8 appears from 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nIn the units place: The digit 8 appears once every ten numbers, like 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. Wait, but 88 has two 8's, but I'm only counting the units place, so each of these contributes one 8 in the units place. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) +9 (units)=19.\n\nNow, three-digit pages: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nTens place: For three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 8. So, let's see:\n\nIn each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit 8 appears in the range x80-x89, where x is the hundreds digit.\n\nSo, for 100-199: 180-189: 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nSimilarly, 200-299: 280-289:10.\n\n300-399:380-389:10.\n\n400-488:480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the 400-488 group, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, total tens digit 8's: 10 (100-199) +10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+9 (400-488)=39.\n\nUnits place: For three-digit numbers, the units digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers in each hundreds group.\n\nSo, for each hundreds group:\n\n100-199: 108,118,128,...,198. That's 10 numbers.\n\n200-299:208,218,...,298:10.\n\n300-399:308,318,...,398:10.\n\n400-488:408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included.\n\nSo, units digit 8's:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place (39) + units place (39)=78.\n\nAdding single-digit and two-digit: single-digit 8's (1) + two-digit 8's (19) + three-digit 8's (78)=1+19=20+78=98.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, total 8's:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1 (page 4).\n\nTwo-digit:\n\nTens place:40-49:10 numbers, so 10.\n\nUnits place:14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94:9 numbers, so 9.\n\nTotal two-digit 4's:10+9=19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place:400-488:89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTens place:10 (100-199) +10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+10 (400-488)=40.\n\nWait, no, earlier I thought 400-488 only had 9 in units, but in tens place, it's 10 because 440-449 is 10 numbers. So, yes, 40.\n\nUnits place:10 (100-199)+10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+9 (400-488)=39.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168.\n\nTotal 4's:1+19+168=188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1 (page 8).\n\nTwo-digit:\n\nTens place:80-89:10.\n\nUnits place:18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98:9.\n\nTotal two-digit 8's:19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nTens place:10 (100-199)+10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+9 (400-488)=39.\n\nUnits place:10 (100-199)+10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+9 (400-488)=39.\n\nTotal three-digit 8's:39+39=78.\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about another approach. Maybe using a formula or a different counting method.\n\nAnother way is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor single-digit numbers (1-9):\n\n- 4 appears once.\n- 8 appears once.\n\nFor two-digit numbers (10-99):\n\n- Tens place: For 4, it's 10 times (40-49).\n- Units place: For 4, it's 9 times (14,24,...,94).\n- Tens place: For 8, it's 10 times (80-89).\n- Units place: For 8, it's 9 times (18,28,...,98).\n\nFor three-digit numbers (100-488):\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n- Tens place: For 4, each hundreds group (100-199, etc.) has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, so 4 groups \u00d710=40.\n- Units place: For 4, each hundreds group has 10 numbers except the last group, which has 9 (since 488 is the end), so 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSimilarly for 8's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n- Tens place: Each hundreds group has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last group which has 9 (480-488), so 10+10+10+9=39.\n- Units place: Each hundreds group has 10 numbers with 8 in the units place, except the last group which has 9 (408,418,...,488), so 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nAdding these up, as before, gives 188 4's and 98 8's, so the difference is 90.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. \n\nFirst, in the single-digit page numbers (1-9), the digit 4 appears only once, on page 4. So that's one 4.\n\nNext, in the two-digit page numbers (10-99), I need to consider both the tens place and the units place. \n\nFor the tens place: The pages from 40-49 all have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 pages, so 10 4's.\n\nFor the units place: The digit 4 appears every 10 pages, so in 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but 44 has a 4 in both tens and units place, but I'm only counting the units place here. So that's 9 times, right? Because from 10-99, the units digit cycles every 10, so 14,24,...,94, which is 9 numbers. Wait, actually, 44 is included, so that's 9 instances. Hmm, but wait, 14 is the first, then 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 times. So 9 4's in the units place.\n\nSo total two-digit 4's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because in the two-digit numbers, the tens place from 40-49 gives 10 4's, and the units place for 4's in two-digit numbers would be from 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94, which is 9 numbers, so 9 4's. So total 10 + 9 = 19 4's in two-digit pages.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488.\n\nIn three-digit numbers, we have hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for 4 in the hundreds place, it's from 400-488. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nNext, the tens place: We need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit page numbers. The three-digit numbers go from 100-488, so let's break it down:\n\n- For hundreds digit 1: The tens digit cycles from 0-9, so 4 in tens place would be from 140-149, which is 10 pages. So 10 4's.\n\n- For hundreds digit 2: Similarly, 240-249, another 10 4's.\n\n- For hundreds digit 3: 340-349, another 10 4's.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4: Now, from 400-488, the tens digit can go up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit 4 would be from 440-449, which is 10 pages. So 10 4's.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so does 449 exist? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 440-449 is 10 pages. So, in total, for the tens place, we have 10 (hundreds=1) + 10 (hundreds=2) + 10 (hundreds=3) + 10 (hundreds=4) = 40 4's.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For hundreds digits 1,2,3, each contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So 3*10=30. Then for hundreds digit 4, it's another 10, so total 40. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the units place: Counting how many times 4 appears in the units place across all three-digit pages. Let's consider each hundreds group:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: From 100-199. The units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 pages. So, for each ten, there's a 4 in the units place. So from 100-199, how many 4's in units place? 10 per hundred, so 10.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2: Similarly, 200-299, another 10 4's.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3: 300-399, another 10 4's.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: Now, 400-488. The units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten, but we have to stop at 488. So, from 400-488, how many complete tens are there? Let's see, 400-488 is 89 pages. The units digit cycles every 10, so 8 full cycles (400-409, 410-419,...,480-489, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 pages. Hmm, so in 400-488, how many times does the units digit 4 appear? Let's see:\n\nFrom 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, but 484 is within 488, so that's 9 instances. Wait, but from 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs every 10 pages, starting at 404, then 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times. So, in hundreds digit 4, units place 4 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total units place 4's: 10 (hundreds=1) + 10 (hundreds=2) + 10 (hundreds=3) + 9 (hundreds=4) = 39.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 10 per hundred, but for hundreds=4, it's only 9 because we stop at 488. So total units place 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For hundreds digits 1,2,3, each contributes 10 units place 4's, so 3*10=30. For hundreds=4, it's 9, so total 39.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, the number of 4's is:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 40\n- Units place: 39\nTotal 4's in three-digit pages: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. So, 168 4's in three-digit pages.\n\nNow, let's total all the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, 1 + 19 is 20, plus 168 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit pages (1-9): The digit 8 appears once, on page 8.\n\nIn two-digit pages (10-99):\n\nTens place: The pages from 80-89 have 8 in the tens place, which is 10 pages, so 10 8's.\n\nUnits place: The digit 8 appears in 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 times, right? Because 88 has an 8 in both tens and units, but we're only counting the units place here. So 9 8's.\n\nSo, two-digit 8's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nNow, three-digit pages (100-488):\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1,2,3,4. So, 8 can't be in the hundreds place because the highest hundreds digit is 4. So, 0 8's in hundreds place.\n\nTens place: Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: Pages 180-189, which is 10 pages, so 10 8's.\n- Hundreds digit 2: Pages 280-289, another 10 8's.\n- Hundreds digit 3: Pages 380-389, another 10 8's.\n- Hundreds digit 4: Pages 480-488. The tens digit is 8, so from 480-488, that's 9 pages (since 488 is the last). So, 9 8's.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nUnits place: Now, counting how many times 8 appears in the units place across all three-digit pages.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: From 100-199. The units digit 8 occurs every 10 pages: 108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198. That's 10 times.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2: Similarly, 208,218,...,298. That's 10 times.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3: 308,318,...,398. That's 10 times.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: From 400-488. The units digit 8 occurs in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 times because 488 is included.\n\nSo, units place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nTherefore, in three-digit pages, the number of 8's is:\n\n- Tens place: 39\n- Units place: 39\nTotal 8's in three-digit pages: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nNow, total 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, 1 + 19 is 20, plus 78 is 98. So, 98 8's in total.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from total 4's:\n\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1 (page 4)\n- Two-digit: 10 (40-49) + 9 (14,24,...,94) = 19\n- Three-digit: 89 (400-488) + 40 (tens place across 100-488) + 39 (units place across 100-488) = 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\nCounting 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1 (page 8)\n- Two-digit: 10 (80-89) + 9 (18,28,...,98) = 19\n- Three-digit: 39 (tens place across 100-488) + 39 (units place across 100-488) = 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I counted the units place 4's in three-digit numbers, I got 39, but let me check again. For hundreds digits 1,2,3, each contributes 10 units place 4's, so 3*10=30. For hundreds=4, units place 4's are 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484, which is 9 times, so 30+9=39. That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, in the units place, hundreds=4 gives 408,418,...,488, which is 9 times. So, 39 in units place for 8's.\n\nWait, but when I counted the tens place for 8's in three-digit numbers, I had 39 as well. So, 39+39=78 for three-digit 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. For hundreds=1,2,3, each contributes 10, so 3*10=30, and for hundreds=4, it's 9, so 30+9=39. That seems correct.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 188, and 8's are 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe total number of 4's printed is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, the first page is 1, so the first block is 1-10, the next is 11-20, and so on until 481-490. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 481-488, which is a partial block of 8 numbers. \n\nWait, but actually, each full block of 10 contributes one 4 in the units place. Let me calculate how many full blocks there are. From page 1 to 488, the number of full tens is 48 (since 48*10=480), and then the last 8 pages (481-488) form a partial block. So, in each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial block, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once in 484. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check again. From 1-10: 4 appears once. 11-20: once, and so on. So, up to 480, which is 48 blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, 481-488: the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total 49. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for the entire block of 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are.\n\nFrom 1-488, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears in the blocks 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is a full block except maybe the last one. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's a full block. So, how many blocks is that? 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5*10 = 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. From 40-49: 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place. Similarly for 140-149, etc. So yes, 5 blocks, 10 each, 50 total.\n\nNow, what about the hundreds place? The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89). Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's. So, I need to count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places from 1 to 488.\n\nStarting with units place: Similar to 4's, in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full blocks of 10 are there? 48 full blocks (since 48*10=480), and then 8 more pages (481-488). Each full block contributes one 8, so 48 times. In the last partial block, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for the blocks 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many full blocks are there?\n\nFirst, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers. So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the last block contributes 9. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me confirm. 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, yes, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems like a big difference.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's. Units place: 48 full blocks (1-480) with one 4 each, so 48, plus 484, so 49. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's: Units place: 48 full blocks, each with one 8, so 48, plus 488, so 49. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 4*10=40 +9=49. So, 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full blocks (1-480) and one more in 484, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear, so 0.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
