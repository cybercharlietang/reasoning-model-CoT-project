    "text": " Maybe I should handle each case separately.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of times the digit 4 appears in each position: units, tens, and hundreds. Similarly, I'll count the number of times the digit 8 appears in each position. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears once and the digit 8 appears once. Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then a partial set of 8 numbers (481-488). \n\nSo, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 (from each complete set) plus one more if the partial set includes a 4. Wait, the partial set is 481-488, so the units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, there's a 4 in 484. So, total 4's in units place: 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: 48 complete sets give 48 eights, and in the partial set, 488 has an 8, so that's one more. So total 8's in units place: 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, that seems like the same number. So, in units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, no difference there.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, ..., 9 for 90-99. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8.\n\nSo, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then a partial hundred from 401-488.\n\nSo, for each complete hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well. So, 4 complete hundreds give 4*10=40 for 4's and 4*10=40 for 8's.\n\nNow, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 480-488). Let me check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for the tens digit being 4: that would be 440-449, but wait, our range is 401-488, so 440-449 is within this range. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens digit being 8: that would be 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n\nWait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 480, 481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the partial hundred.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) +10 (from 440-449) =50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) +9 (from 480-488) =49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 49 times. So, 4's are more by 1 here.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, in 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, which we can ignore. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit goes up to 4 in this book, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place:89, and 8's:0. So, 4's are way more here by 89.\n\nNow, let me sum up the totals for each digit.\n\nTotal 4's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's =49 +50 +89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's=49 +49 +0=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems quite a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nUnits place: Each 10 numbers, 4 and 8 appear once each. 488 pages mean 48 full tens and 8 extra. For 4's: 48 +1=49. For 8's:48 +1=49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. 4 complete hundreds:4*10=40 for each. Then, in 401-488, 440-449 gives 10 times 4 in tens place, and 480-488 gives 9 times 8 in tens place. So, 4's:40+10=50, 8's:40+9=49. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place. So, 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's.\n\nAdding up: 49+50+89=188 for 4's, 49+49+0=98 for 8's. Difference is 90. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 -400 +1=89. So, yes, 89 times. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all in this book, so that's correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90. So, 4's are printed 90 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when I added up the 4's, I included units, tens, and hundreds. Similarly for 8's. So, 4's:49+50+89=188, 8's:49+49+0=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each 10 numbers contribute one 4 and one 8.\n   - 488 pages have 48 full sets of 10, plus a partial set of 8 (481-488).\n   - 4's: 48 + 1 (from 484) = 49\n   - 8's: 48 + 1 (from 488) = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each 100 numbers contribute 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n   - 488 pages have 4 full hundreds, contributing 40 each for 4 and 8.\n   - In the partial hundred (401-488), 440-449 adds 10 more 4's, and 480-488 adds 9 more 8's.\n   - 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 400-488 contributes 89 occurrences of 4.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - 4's: 89\n   - 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place one by one. For the units place, I can count how many times 4 and 8 appear. Similarly, for the tens place, and then the hundreds place. But wait, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds place can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for the hundreds place, 4 can appear, but 8 can't because 800 is beyond 488. So, in the hundreds place, 8 doesn't appear at all, but 4 does. That might give me some difference right there.\n\nLet me try to formalize this. For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), I can calculate the number of times 4 appears and the number of times 8 appears, then subtract the two totals to find how many more 4's there are.\n\nStarting with the units place. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each block of 10, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. How many such blocks are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). In each complete block, 4 and 8 each appear once, so that's 48 times each. Now, in the partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, they are equal, so no difference there.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the tens digit goes from 0-9 for each ten numbers. So, for each ten block (e.g., 00-09, 10-19, ..., 90-99), the tens digit is the same for 10 numbers. So, in each block of 100, 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (e.g., 40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89). Now, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, from 1 to 400, there are 4 complete hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so that's 4*10 = 40 each. Then, from 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in the tens place, we have 400-409 (tens digit 0), 410-419 (tens 1), ..., 480-488 (tens 8). So, for the tens digit, 4 appears once in the 440-449 range, which is 10 times, but wait, 488 is only up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. Wait, no, I'm talking about the tens digit. Let me clarify: the tens digit for 400-488 is from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but since 488 is the end, that's okay. Similarly, tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480 is the start and 488 is the end, so that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so 9 times. Wait, but in the tens place, each occurrence is for 10 numbers, except maybe the last one. Wait, 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times in the tens place in this last partial hundred.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's. But in the last partial hundred, from 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except for the last one, which is 8 and appears only 9 times. Hmm, so for the tens place in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (440-449), and the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times (480-488). So, adding up:\n\nFrom 1-400: 4*10=40 4's and 4*10=40 8's in the tens place.\n\nFrom 401-488: 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times, so 4's are more by 1.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. Each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, etc.) has the same hundreds digit for 100 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no: 400-488 is 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive), so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. The hundreds digit 8 never appears because the book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit can't be 8. So, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, and 8's appear 0 times.\n\nSo, summing up:\n\nUnits place: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nTens place: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nHundreds place: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nNow, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, and then in the partial block (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, units 4's: 48 +1=49, units 8's:48 +1=49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 for 4's and 40 for 8's. Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. The tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, total tens 4's:40 +10=50, tens 8's:40 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 1-399, the hundreds digit is 1,2,3, so 4 doesn't appear. From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). So, 89 4's. 8's never appear in hundreds place. So, hundreds 4's:89, hundreds 8's:0.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I feel like I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me think again: from 1-99, hundreds digit is 0 (since we're considering three-digit numbers, but actually, page numbers 1-99 are two-digit, so the hundreds digit is 0 for them. So, in the hundreds place, 4's only appear from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. 8's never appear in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so 800-899 isn't included. So, that part is correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, when I'm calculating from 401-488, I considered the tens digit 4 as 10 times and 8 as 9 times. But wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for each of those, so that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, the 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place.\n\nSo, the total 4's in the tens place is 50, and 8's is 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, adding up, the total 4's are 188, and 8's are 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to double-count or miss some ranges. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears: floor(488/10)*1 + (if the last partial block has a units digit >=4, add 1). So, floor(488/10)=48, and since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so units 4's:48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, units 8's: floor(488/10)*1 + (if last digit >=8, add 1). So, 48 +1=49.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in tens place: floor(488/100)*10 + (if the last partial hundred has tens digit >=4, add the extra). So, floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. Now, the last partial hundred is 400-488, so the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, tens 8's: floor(488/100)*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 40 +9=49.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears: floor(488/1000)=0, but since 400-488 is part of the book, the hundreds digit 4 occurs from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89.\n\nNumber of times 8 appears in hundreds place: since 800 is beyond 488, it's 0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me just check with a smaller example to see if my method works. Suppose we have a 40-page book. Let's count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFrom 1-40, 4 appears in 4,14,24,34: 4 times.\n\n8 appears in 8,18,28,38: 4 times.\n\nTens place:\n\n4 appears in 40-49, but since we only go up to 40, it's 1 number (40). So, 1 time.\n\n8 appears in 80-89, which isn't in 40, so 0 times.\n\nHundreds place: 0 times for both.\n\nTotal 4's:4+1=5.\n\nTotal 8's:4+0=4.\n\nDifference:1. Which is correct because in 1-40, 4's are 5 and 8's are 4.\n\nWait, but according to my method:\n\nUnits place: floor(40/10)=4, so 4+1 if last digit >=4. Last digit is 0, so no. So, units 4's:4.\n\nUnits 8's: floor(40/10)=4, last digit >=8? 40 mod 10=0, which is <8, so units 8's:4.\n\nTens place:\n\n4's: floor(40/100)=0, but in the last partial hundred (1-40), the tens digit 4 occurs once (40). So, 1.\n\n8's: floor(40/100)=0, and in the last partial hundred, tens digit 8 occurs 0 times.\n\nHundreds place:0 for both.\n\nSo, total 4's:4+1=5.\n\nTotal 8's:4+0=4.\n\nDifference:1. Which matches.\n\nSo, my method works for this small example. Therefore, I think my calculation for 488 pages is correct, giving a difference of 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Range:** The book has pages from 1 to 488.\n\n2. **Analyze Each Digit Place:**\n   - **Units Place:** \n     - Each 10 numbers, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place.\n     - Total complete blocks of 10: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n     - In the partial block (481-488), 4 and 8 each appear once.\n     - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n     - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each 100 numbers, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place.\n     - Complete hundreds: 4 (1-400).\n     - In 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n     - Total 4's in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 10 = 50.\n     - Total 8's in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n     - 8 never appears as the hundreds digit.\n     - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n     - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n3. **Sum Up Occurrences:**\n   - Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by considering each digit place one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the units place and how many times 8 appears there. For the units digit, every 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. Now, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). Wait, no, actually, 488 is the last page, so from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. That would give 48 4's and 48 8's from the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, in these, the units digit 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, adding that, the total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), ..., 9 (90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers. So, in 488 pages, how many complete hundreds do we have? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). Wait, no, actually, 401-488 is 88 pages, but in terms of hundreds, each hundred block is 100 pages. So, from 1 to 400, there are four complete hundreds, and then 88 more pages. So, in each of the four hundreds, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for each hundred, 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. Since there are four hundreds, that's 4*10=40 4's and 4*10=40 8's. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), let's look at the tens place. The tens digits here range from 0 to 8, as 401-409 have tens digit 0, 410-419 have tens digit 1, up to 480-488 having tens digit 8. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in 401-488? Let's see. The tens digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449. Wait, but 401-488 includes 440-449, right? So, from 440 to 449, that's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 10 more 4's in the tens place. Similarly, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but since 488 is the end, it's 9 numbers. Wait, 480 is the first, so 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. So, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens place contributes 10 4's and 9 8's. So, adding to the previous counts: 40 + 10 = 50 4's in the tens place, and 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. So, the difference here is 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is the third digit in the page numbers, but since we're dealing with a 488-page book, the hundreds digit can only be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, no, actually, for page numbers 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, but since we're only considering printed page numbers, maybe we don't count leading zeros. So, the hundreds digit is only present when the page number is 100 or more. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so we don't count anything there. From 100 onwards, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, let's see how many times each digit appears in the hundreds place. For 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, so 100 times. Similarly, 200-299: hundreds digit 2, 100 times. 300-399: hundreds digit 3, 100 times. 400-488: hundreds digit 4, 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times, and 8 does not appear in the hundreds place at all because 800 would be beyond 488. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts from each digit place:\n\n- Units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49 \u2192 difference 0\n- Tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49 \u2192 difference +1\n- Hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0 \u2192 difference +89\n\nSo, total difference is 0 + 1 + 89 = 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place: 488 pages. For units digits, every 10 pages, each digit 0-9 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48*1=48 for each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units 4's: 48+1=49, same for 8's. So, units place difference is 0.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 10 4's and 10 8's. There are four complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). So, 4*10=40 each. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). The tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more 4's. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more 8's. So, total tens 4's: 40 +10=50, tens 8's:40 +9=49. So, difference +1.\n\nHundreds place: From 100-199, hundreds digit 1: 100 times. 200-299: hundreds digit 2: 100 times. 300-399: hundreds digit 3: 100 times. 400-488: hundreds digit 4: 89 times. So, 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. So, difference +89.\n\nAdding up the differences: 0 (units) +1 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I accounted for all page numbers correctly. For example, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, which is correct. So, 89 times.\n\nWait, but when I was calculating the tens place for 401-488, I considered 440-449 as 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. Similarly, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nAnother way to think about it: For each digit place, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula for each digit place.\n\nFor the units digit: The number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is given by:\n\ncount = (N + 1) // 10 * 1 + (1 if (N + 1) % 10 > d else 0) if d != 0 else ((N + 1) // 10) * 1\n\nWait, maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, for units digit, the count is (N // 10) + (1 if (N % 10 >= d) else 0) for d != 0.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use a more systematic approach.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears: floor(488 / 10) + (1 if (488 % 10 >= 4) else 0) = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly for 8: floor(488 / 10) + (1 if (488 % 10 >= 8) else 0) = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSo, units digit: 49 each.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears: floor(488 / 100) * 10 + (if (488 % 100 >= 40) then (488 % 100 - 40 + 1) else 0).\n\nWait, floor(488 / 100) = 4, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nThen, 488 % 100 = 88. Since 88 >= 40, the extra is 88 - 40 +1 = 49. Wait, but that can't be right because in the tens place, each block of 100 contributes 10 times for each digit. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, the number of times a digit d appears in the tens place is:\n\ncount = (N // 100) * 10 + (if (N % 100 >= d*10) then (N % 100 - d*10 + 1) else 0).\n\nSo, for 4 in the tens place:\n\ncount = (488 // 100) * 10 + (if 488 % 100 >= 40 then (488 % 100 - 40 +1) else 0).\n\n488 // 100 = 4, so 4*10=40.\n\n488 % 100 =88 >=40, so 88 -40 +1=49. So, total 40 +49=89? Wait, that can't be right because from 1-488, the tens digit 4 appears more than 40 times. Wait, no, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nFor a digit d in the tens place, the count is:\n\ncount = (N // 100) * 10 + min(max(N % 100 - d*10 +1, 0), 10).\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nFor d=4:\n\nN=488.\n\nN // 100 =4, so 4*10=40.\n\nN % 100=88.\n\n88 - 40=48.\n\nSo, min(48 +1,10)=9? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\ncount = (N // 100) * 10 + (if (N % 100 >= d*10) then (N % 100 - d*10 +1) else 0).\n\nBut if N % 100 - d*10 +1 could be more than 10, but in reality, the tens digit cycles every 100, so it's either 10 times per hundred, plus the remainder.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of:\n\nFor the tens digit, the number of times 4 appears is:\n\nIn each hundred, 10 times. So, 4 hundreds give 40 times. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 440-449, that's 10 times. So, total 40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place: each hundred gives 10 times, so 4*10=40. In the last partial hundred, 480-488: 9 times. So, total 40 +9=49.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nSimilarly, for the hundreds digit:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears: from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nNumber of times 8 appears: zero, since 800 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\nUnits: 49 4's, 49 8's.\n\nTens:50 4's,49 8's.\n\nHundreds:89 4's,0 8's.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me cross-verify. Maybe I can calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately and then find the difference.\n\nCalculating total 4's:\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nTens place:50.\n\nHundreds place:89.\n\nTotal:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nTens place:49.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. We analyze each digit place (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total complete blocks of 10 in 488 pages: 48.\n   - 48 occurrences of each digit in the units place.\n   - Remaining 8 numbers (481-488) add 1 more 4 and 1 more 8.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - Four complete hundreds (1-400) give 40 occurrences of each digit.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n     - Tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - Tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, 488 is a three-digit number, so all pages from 100 to 488 are three digits. \n\nI think the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start with the digit 4. I'll consider each position separately.\n\nFirst, the units place. For the units digit to be 4, the page numbers would be 4, 14, 24, 34, ..., up to the largest number less than or equal to 488. To find how many such numbers there are, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 times. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, the last group would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the 488 is part of this group. So, does that mean there are 49 numbers ending with 4? Wait, no, because 488 is 488, which is 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but the 48th group would be 480-489, but since we stop at 488, the number 488 has 8 in the units place, so maybe the units digit 4 occurs 48 times? Hmm, maybe I should think differently. For each group of ten numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so in each group, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, does the last partial group (481-488) include a number ending with 4? 484 is in that group, so that's an additional 4 in the units place. So, total units digit 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, that makes sense because from 1-480, there are 48 groups, each contributing one 4, and then 484 is the 49th occurrence. \n\nWait, but 488 is 488, so 480 is the start of the 48th group, so 480-489 would be the 48th group, but since we only go up to 488, the 484 is within that group, so yes, that adds one more. So, units digit 4's: 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. For the tens digit to be 4, the page numbers would be 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, the tens digit 4 appears 50 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 40-49: 10 numbers, 40-49. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on up to 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. So, yes, 50 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. For the hundreds digit to be 4, the page numbers would be 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times.\n\nWait, but wait, 400 is the first number with hundreds digit 4, and 488 is the last. So, the count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's are 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. The units digit is 8 in page numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to the 4's, each group of ten contributes one 8. From 1 to 488, how many complete groups of ten are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. But, does the last group (481-488) include an 8 in the units place? 488 is the last page, which ends with 8, so that's an additional occurrence. So, units digit 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in page numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 group, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 in 480-488 is still 8, so each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers except maybe the last one. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total tens digit 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in page numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, hundreds digit 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's are 188, total 8's are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49 (from 4,14,...,484)\n- Tens: 50 (from 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449)\n- Hundreds: 89 (from 400-488)\nTotal: 49+50+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49 (from 8,18,...,488)\n- Tens: 49 (from 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488)\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49+49=98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90. So, the final answer is \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each case separately because the number of digits affects how often each digit appears.\n\nLet me start by calculating how many times the digit 4 appears in each position: units, tens, and hundreds. Then I'll do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and a partial block of 8 (since 488 = 48*10 + 8). In each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the partial block from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once here as well (at 484). So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, actually, let me check that. The first page is 1, so the first block is 1-10, then 11-20, etc., up to 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the last block is 481-488. So, in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear?\n\nEach 10 pages contribute one 4 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, and then in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 484 is within this range, so that's one more 4. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens digit. The digit 4 in the tens place occurs in blocks of 100. Specifically, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 consecutive numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n\nWait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last block for the tens place being 4 is 440-449, because 450-459 would be 5 in the tens place, and 460-469 is 6, etc., up to 488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nEach occurrence is 10 numbers, and how many such blocks are there?\n\nFrom 0-99: 40-49 is one block, that's 10 numbers.\n\nFrom 100-199: 140-149, another 10 numbers.\n\nFrom 200-299: 240-249, another 10.\n\nFrom 300-399: 340-349, another 10.\n\nFrom 400-488: 440-449, which is another 10 numbers (440-449). But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10.\n\nSo, total blocks where tens digit is 4: 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 * 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check the last block. From 400-488, 440-449 is within that range, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50 4's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The digit 4 in the hundreds place occurs from 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's.\n\nWait, but wait, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, in each block of 10, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full blocks of 10 are there? 48 full blocks (since 48*10=480), and then 8 more pages (481-488). So, in each full block, one 8, so 48 times. In the partial block, units digits go from 1-8, so 488 is included, which is an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check: from 1-480, that's 48 blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then from 481-488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, so 488 has an 8, so that's one more. So, total units 8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit being 8. This occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488.\n\nSo, each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except possibly the last block if it's cut short.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nWait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the tens place, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's, and the last block contributes 9 8's.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4 * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check again. From 400-488, the tens digit being 8 is in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit being 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), or 4 (400-488). So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 full blocks (1-480) each contribute one 4, so 48. Then 481-488, which has 484, so one more. So, 49.\n\n- Tens: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 full blocks (1-480), each contributing one 8, so 48. Then 481-488 has 488, so one more. Total 49.\n\n- Tens: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks each contribute 10, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, is 9 numbers, so 9. Total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds: None, since the book ends at 488, so hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about the hundreds place for 4's, I counted 89 numbers from 400 to 488 inclusive. Let me confirm that: 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place in 8's, I considered that 480-488 is 9 numbers, which is correct because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** \n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4. \n   - There are 48 full blocks (480 pages) and one partial block (481-488), contributing 1 more 4.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** \n   - Each occurrence (e.g., 40-49) contributes 10 4's.\n   - There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** \n   - Pages 400-488 each have 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 numbers.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** \n   - Each block of 10 contributes one 8.\n   - 48 full blocks and one partial block (481-488) with 488.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** \n   - Each occurrence (e.g., 80-89) contributes 10 8's.\n   - There are 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial block (480-488) contributing 9 8's.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** \n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately\u2014units, tens, hundreds. That might make it easier to count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For each group of ten pages, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for every ten pages, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Now, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, we'll have 48 full groups and then 8 more pages (481-488). In each of these 48 groups, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so that's 48 4's and 48 8's from the units place.\n\nBut wait, we also have those last 8 pages: 481-488. The units digits here are 1 through 8. So, in the units place, there's one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, that adds 1 more 4 and 1 more 8. Therefore, in the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, 48 + 1 = 49. So, so far, units place gives us 49 each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place within each hundred. So, in each hundred, there's 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. Now, since the book is 488 pages, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each of these 4 hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, that's 4 * 10 = 40 4's and 40 8's from the tens place in the first 400 pages.\n\nNow, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here? Let's see:\n\n- The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 401-488. So, that's 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n- The tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 pages (480-488). So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 pages, right? So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times. So, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, adding to the previous counts:\n\nTotal 4's in tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49\n\nWait, but wait, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit goes up to 8, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 pages, as I thought. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, which we can ignore. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299 is 2; 300-399 is 3; and 400-488 is 4. So, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place?\n\nWell, 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488. So, how many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nBut wait, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all, so the count for 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's and 8's:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, but let me double-check the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 in all of them, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier, in the tens place, I had 50 4's and 49 8's. So, total 4's are 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. And 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place. I had 40 4's and 40 8's from the first 400 pages, then in 401-488, 10 4's and 9 8's, so total 50 and 49. That seems correct.\n\nAnother way to check: Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nUnits place:\n- For each 10 pages, one 4 and one 8. There are 48 full tens (1-480), which gives 48 each, and then 481-488: units digits 1-8, so one 4 and one 8. So total 49 each. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) give 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digits go up to 8. The tens digit is 4 in 440-449 (10 times) and 8 in 480-488 (9 times). So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 never appears. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each group of ten pages (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) has exactly one '4' and one '8' in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full groups of ten in 480 pages, contributing 48 '4's and 48 '8's.\n   - The remaining pages (481-488) add one more '4' (484) and one more '8' (488).\n   - **Total in units place:** 49 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred (e.g., 1-100) has ten occurrences of '4' and ten of '8' in the tens place.\n   - For the first 400 pages, there are four hundreds, contributing 40 '4's and 40 '8's.\n   - In pages 401-488, the tens digit '4' appears in 440-449 (10 times), and '8' appears in 480-488 (9 times).\n   - **Total in tens place:** 50 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is '4' from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages.\n   - '8' never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89 '4's and 0 '8's.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **'4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - **'8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 '4's - 98 '8's = 90 more '4's.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately in each digit place and then compare them.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each place separately for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, every 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once. So, for example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit appears once every 10 numbers. Now, how many times does 4 appear in the units place from 1 to 488?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 pages, and then 8 extra pages (481-488). In each full set of 10, 4 appears once in the units place. So that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, in each set of 10, 8 appears once. So 48 sets give 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 pages, 8 appears once (on page 488). So total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so for the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. So, so far, they're equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place from 1 to 488? Let's see.\n\nFirst, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds, and then 88 pages into the fifth hundred. Wait, no, actually, 488 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. So, in each full hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but we only go up to 488). So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, that's another 10 times. So total 4's in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place. In each full hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 40 times. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 pages (480-488). So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the partial hundred. So total 8's in the tens place would be 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. So, 4 is ahead by 1 so far.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place here. So, 8's in the hundreds place are 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up all the digits:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 = 90, but I think I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. So, 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, in the partial hundred, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 49 each, so correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the units place, from 1-488, how many 4's? Every 10 pages, so 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last 8 pages, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: same, 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place: For 4's, in each hundred, 10 times. So 4 hundreds: 40. Then in 401-488, the tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10. So, 40 +10=50. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: Each hundred, 10 times, so 40. Then in 401-488, 480-488: 9 pages, so 9. So, 40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I thought maybe the answer would be 90, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot. Let me check if I counted correctly.\n\nWait, another way: Maybe I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position and sum them up.\n\nWait, another approach: For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), count how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in units place? As before, 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490), but since we only go up to 488, the last decade is 481-490, but we stop at 488. So, in each decade, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 decades, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus, in the last partial decade (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once. So, total 49.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: same logic, 48 full decades, each contributing 1, and in the last partial decade, 8 appears once (on page 488). So, 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's in tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449). So, in each hundred, 10 times. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). So, 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the fifth hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 +10=50.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-489). But since we only go up to 488, in the fifth hundred, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 4 full hundreds give 4 *10=40. Then, in the fifth hundred, 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4's: The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488. That's 488 -400 +1=89 numbers.\n\nFor 8's: The hundreds digit is 8 from 800-899, but since the book only has 488 pages, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so that's 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, that seems correct based on my calculations.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe I'm overcounting somewhere. For example, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is correct because from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 pages. Each of those has a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's, I have 50, which includes 40 from the first four hundreds and 10 from 440-449 in the fifth hundred. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, 49, which is 40 from the first four hundreds and 9 from 480-488. That's correct.\n\nUnits place: both 49, which is correct.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting '4's:**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers, '4' appears once. There are 48 full decades (1-480) and 8 extra pages (481-488). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** Each hundred has 10 occurrences of '4' in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds (1-400) contributing 40, plus 10 in 440-449. Total: 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, '4' appears 89 times.\n\n   Total '4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting '8's:**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to '4's, '8' appears 49 times.\n   - **Tens Place:** Each hundred has 10 '8's in the tens place. 4 full hundreds give 40, plus 9 in 480-488. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** '8' never appears in the hundreds place here.\n\n   Total '8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nLet me start by thinking about the units place. For every 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10 pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. That means for the units digit, the number of 4's and 8's should be the same, right? So, if I can figure out how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488 pages, I can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place. \n\nWait, but 488 isn't a multiple of 10. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra pages. In each complete block, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place. Now, the extra 8 pages (481 to 488) will have units digits from 1 to 8. So, in these, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8. So, units place contributes equally, no difference there.\n\nNext, let me consider the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well. Now, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each of the 4 complete hundreds, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times, so each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4's in tens place: 4 * 10 = 40. Similarly, 8's in tens place: 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the remaining 88 pages (401-488) have tens digits from 0 to 8. Wait, let me think: 401-410: tens digit is 0, 411-420: 1, ..., 481-488: 8. So, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except for the last one, which only goes up to 8 pages. \n\nWait, no, actually, 401-488 is 88 pages. Let's see: 401-410 is 10 pages, 411-420 is another 10, and so on up to 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, the tens digits in this partial hundred are 0 (10 times), 1 (10), ..., 8 (8 times). So, for the tens digit in 401-488, 4 appears once in the tens place (440-449), which is 10 pages, so 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears once in the tens place (480-489), but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 pages (480-488). Wait, no: 480-489 would be 10 pages, but we only have up to 488, so 9 pages. Wait, but 480 is included, so from 480 to 488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. Wait, but in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here. So, total for the tens digit in the partial hundred: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. From 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). Each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times because 481-488 is 8 pages. Wait, no, 481-488 is 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages, not 9. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 8 times (480-488). So, in the partial hundred, 4's in tens place: 10, 8's: 8. \n\nSo, total for tens place across all pages: 4's = 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from partial) = 50. 8's = 40 + 8 = 48. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, 8's 48 times. So, 4's have 2 more in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit cycles 1, 2, 3, and then 4. Now, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no contribution.\n\n100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so 100 times.\n\n200-299: hundreds digit is 2, 100 times.\n\n300-399: hundreds digit is 3, 100 times.\n\n400-488: hundreds digit is 4, 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nWait, 400 to 488 is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place:\n\n4 appears 89 times.\n\n8 appears 0 times because the hundreds digits are 1,2,3,4, and 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but 888 is beyond 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place in this book.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, that's a difference of 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each digit place.\n\nUnits place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49. Difference: 0.\n\nTens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 48. Difference: +2.\n\nHundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0. Difference: +89.\n\nSo, total difference: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have 484 and 488, so 4 and 8 each once. So, total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: Each complete hundred (4 of them) contributes 10 4's and 10 8's. So, 4*10=40 each. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. Tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages? Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, 9 times. So, 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50, 8's: 40 +9=49. Wait, earlier I thought 8's were 48, but now I'm getting 49. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me recount the partial hundred:\n\n401-488: 88 pages.\n\nThe tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n\nEach tens digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times each (e.g., 401-410: tens digit 0, 411-420: 1, ..., 471-480:7). That's 8 digits (0-7), each appearing 10 times, so 8*10=80 pages. Then, the remaining 8 pages are 481-488, which have tens digit 8, so 8 times.\n\nWait, but 80 +8=88, which is correct. So, in the tens place:\n\n- 4 appears in the tens place when the tens digit is 4, which is 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times.\n\n- 8 appears in the tens place when the tens digit is 8, which is 480-488, which is 9 pages (480 to 488 inclusive). So, 9 times.\n\nSo, in the partial hundred, 4's in tens place:10, 8's:9.\n\nThus, total in tens place:\n\n4's: 40 (from complete hundreds) +10=50.\n\n8's:40 +9=49.\n\nSo, difference in tens place:50-49=+1.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was +2. So, I must have miscalculated before.\n\nThen, moving on to hundreds place:\n\n4's:89, 8's:0. So, difference: +89.\n\nSo, total differences:\n\nUnits:0, Tens:+1, Hundreds:+89. Total difference:90.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial calculation. So, where did I go wrong earlier?\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake in the tens place earlier when I thought 8's were 48. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's:50, 8's:49. So, 50-49=+1.\n\nThen, hundreds place: +89.\n\nSo, total difference:1+89=90.\n\nWait, but let me check again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, that's 89 more 4's.\n\nIn the tens place, 4's are 50, 8's are 49, so 1 more 4.\n\nUnits place: equal, so 0.\n\nSo, total more 4's than 8's:89 +1=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything else.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to calculate the total number of 4's and 8's across all digit places.\n\nSo, total 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n\n- Tens:50\n\n- Hundreds:89\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n\n- Tens:49\n\n- Hundreds:0\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 91, but after correcting the tens place, it's 90. So, the correct answer should be 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these pages, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, 4's in tens place:10, 8's:9. So, 4's have 1 more in tens place.\n\nUnits place: equal.\n\nSo, total difference:89 (hundreds) +1 (tens)=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) has one '4' and one '8' in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks of 10 in 488 pages, contributing 48 '4's and 48 '8's.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one '4' (484) and one '8' (488).\n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Difference in units place:** 49 - 49 = 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred (e.g., 1-100) has 10 occurrences of '4' and '8' in the tens place.\n   - With 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 '4's and 40 '8's.\n   - In the partial hundred (401-488), '4' appears 10 times (440-449), and '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Difference in tens place:** 50 - 49 = +1.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - '4' appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place within 488 pages.\n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89.\n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0.\n   - **Difference in hundreds place:** 89 - 0 = +89.\n\n4. **Total Difference:**\n   - Summing the differences from each place: 0 (units) + 1 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 90.\n   - Therefore, 90 more '4's are printed than '8's.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nLet me start by considering how often the digit 4 and 8 appear in each place. I'll need to count the number of times 4 appears in the units place, tens place, and hundreds place, and do the same for 8. Then, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.) and the digit 8 appears once (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). \n\nNow, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups and a partial group of 8 pages (481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete group of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 complete groups, that's 48 times each. So, 48 fours and 48 eights from the units place. \n\nNow, the partial group is from 481 to 488, which is 8 pages. Let's list them: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Looking at the units digits, we have 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in the units place, there's one 4 and one 8 in this partial group. \n\nSo, total units place: 48 (complete) + 1 (partial) = 49 fours, and 48 +1 = 49 eights. So, units place contributes equally to both digits. Hmm, that's interesting. So, in the units place, 4 and 8 appear the same number of times. \n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit goes 0 (10 times), 1 (10 times), ..., 9 (10 times). So, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89). \n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred from 401-488. \n\nEach complete hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 fours and 4*10=40 eights. \n\nNow, the partial hundred is from 401-488. Let's look at the tens digits here. From 401-409, the tens digit is 0. From 410-419, it's 1. From 420-429, it's 2. From 430-439, it's 3. From 440-449, it's 4. From 450-459, it's 5. From 460-469, it's 6. From 470-479, it's 7. From 480-488, it's 8. \n\nSo, in the partial hundred, the tens digit is 8 in the range 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. \n\nWait, but in the tens place, the digit is 8 for 9 numbers, so that's 9 eights. However, for fours, in the range 440-449, the tens digit is 4. How many numbers is that? From 440 to 449, that's 10 numbers. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, right? So, 10 fours in the tens place from 440-449. \n\nSo, in the partial hundred, tens place: 10 fours and 9 eights. \n\nSo, total tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) +10 =50 fours, and 40 +9=49 eights. So, tens place contributes 50 fours and 49 eights. \n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for numbers from 100 onwards. So, in the hundreds place, the digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\nLet me think about how many times each digit appears in the hundreds place. \n\nFor numbers 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1. From 200-299, it's 2. From 300-399, it's 3. From 400-488, it's 4. \n\nSo, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place? \n\n- 1 appears 100 times (100-199)\n- 2 appears 100 times (200-299)\n- 3 appears 100 times (300-399)\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488, which is 89 numbers: 400 is the first, 488 is the last, so 488-400+1=89)\n\nWait, let me check that: 400 to 488 inclusive is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. \n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears... Wait, 8 in the hundreds place doesn't appear at all because the book only goes up to 488. The hundreds digit can only be 1,2,3,4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. \n\nSo, hundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights. \n\nNow, let me sum up the totals for each digit.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor eights:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal eights = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- Each group of 10 has one 4 and one 8. 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48 fours and 48 eights. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, units: 49 fours, 49 eights. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred has 10 fours and 10 eights. 4 full hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40 fours, 4*10=40 eights.\n- Partial hundred (401-488): in tens place, 4 appears in 440-449 (10 times), and 8 appears in 480-488 (9 times). So, tens: 40+10=50 fours, 40+9=49 eights. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 never appears. So, hundreds: 89 fours, 0 eights. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 49 +50 +89 = 188\nTotal eights:49 +49 +0=98\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place in the partial hundred. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-409), 1 (410-419), ..., up to 8 (480-488). So, for the tens digit being 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For the tens digit being 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: For the tens digit, in each hundred, the digits 0-9 each appear 10 times. So, in the partial hundred, how many times does each tens digit appear? From 401-488, that's 88 numbers. Wait, no, 488 -400 =88, but 401-488 is 88 numbers, right? Wait, 488 -400 =88, but 401 is the first, so 488 -401 +1=88 numbers. So, 88 numbers in the partial hundred. \n\nBut in the tens place, each digit from 0-8 appears how many times? Let's see:\n\nFrom 401-409: tens digit 0 (9 numbers)\n410-419: tens digit 1 (10 numbers)\n420-429: tens digit 2 (10 numbers)\n430-439: tens digit 3 (10 numbers)\n440-449: tens digit 4 (10 numbers)\n450-459: tens digit 5 (10 numbers)\n460-469: tens digit 6 (10 numbers)\n470-479: tens digit 7 (10 numbers)\n480-488: tens digit 8 (9 numbers)\n\nAdding up: 9 +10+10+10+10+10+10+10+9= 88, which matches. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times. So, correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. The difference is 90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by calculating how many times the digit 4 appears in each place. Then I'll do the same for the digit 8 and find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles through 0-9. So, in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. Similarly, the digit 8 also appears once. So, for the units place, I can calculate how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488 pages and then multiply by 1 for each digit.\n\nBut wait, 488 isn't a multiple of 10, so there's a partial block at the end. Let me see, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each complete block, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place, so that's 48 times each. Now, in the partial block from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (at 484), and 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, the count is equal here.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit goes from 0-9 ten times each. So, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). \n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401-488. \n\nIn each complete block, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place, so that's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 times each. Now, the partial block is 401-488. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. \n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's 10 times. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 9 times (480-488). Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 from 480-489, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times? Wait, no, actually, each number from 480-489 has 8 in the tens place, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, 9 times for 8 in the tens place in the partial block.\n\nWait, but 480 is included in the partial block, so let me check: 401-488. So, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For 8 in the tens place, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, in the partial block, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, total for the tens place: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 for 4, plus 10 in the partial block, so 50 times for 4. For 8, it's 4 blocks \u00d710=40 plus 9 in the partial block, so 49 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. So, 4 has one more in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 89 times for 4 in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4. Therefore, 8 in the hundreds place appears 0 times.\n\nSo, summing up for each place:\n\nUnits place:\n- 4: 49 times\n- 8: 49 times\n\nTens place:\n- 4: 50 times\n- 8: 49 times\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4: 89 times\n- 8: 0 times\n\nNow, total for each digit:\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nTotal pages: 488.\n\nNumber of complete blocks of 10: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 with remainder 8.\n\nSo, 48 blocks \u00d7 1 each = 48 for units place for both 4 and 8.\n\nThen, the remaining 8 numbers: 481-488. The units digits here are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both digits. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach block of 100 contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place.\n\nNumber of complete blocks of 100: 4 (since 4\u00d7100=400, and 488 is beyond that).\n\nSo, 4\u00d710=40 for both digits in the tens place.\n\nNow, the partial block from 401-488.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449: 10 times.\n\n8 appears in 480-488: 9 times (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place).\n\nSo, total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4; 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, so 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n\n8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, correct. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the hundreds digit being 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nAnd 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 90. Therefore, 4's are printed 90 times more than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n1. **Units Place Analysis:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks (488 \u00f7 10 = 48 with a remainder of 8).\n   - In the partial block (481-488), 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place Analysis:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 complete blocks (488 \u00f7 100 = 4 with a remainder of 88).\n   - In the partial block (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place Analysis:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, contributing 89 4's.\n   - The hundreds digit is never 8, contributing 0 8's.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 times more than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I might need to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by thinking about how often each digit appears in each place. For the units place, in every block of 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once. So, for example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit appears once every 10 numbers. Similarly, in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in a block of 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each (from 1-10, 11-20, ..., 91-100). The same logic applies to the hundreds place, but each digit appears 100 times in a block of 1000 numbers.\n\nWait, but in this case, the book only goes up to 488, so I need to adjust for that. Let me think about each digit place separately.\n\nStarting with the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears once. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, for the units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times, plus in the last partial block, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, digits 1-8 appear once more, and 9 and 0 don't appear in this partial block. Therefore, for the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and the digit 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times as well. Wait, but let me check: in the last 8 numbers, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 and 8 each appear once more. So, yes, units place: 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 extra numbers (401-488). So, in each of the 4 complete blocks, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for digits 4 and 8, each appears 4*10 = 40 times in the tens place from the complete blocks.\n\nNow, let's look at the partial block from 401-488. The tens digit here cycles through 0-8. Let me see: from 401-410, tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit is 1; ... up to 481-490, but wait, the book only goes up to 488. So, actually, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but only up to 488). So, in the tens place, for each digit from 0 to 8, how many times do they appear? From 401-488, the tens digits go through 0 (10 times: 401-410), 1 (10 times: 411-420), ..., up to 8 (9 times: 481-488). Wait, because 488 is the last page, so 481-488 is only 8 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times, not 10. Wait, no, 481-490 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 numbers. So, in the tens place, from 401-488, each digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it appears 10 times (from 441-450, but wait, no, wait: in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in the range 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in the partial block. Similarly, digit 8 in the tens place appears 8 times (from 481-488). Therefore, in the tens place, digit 4 appears 40 (from complete blocks) + 10 = 50 times, and digit 8 appears 40 + 8 = 48 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Each complete block of 100 contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, 4 blocks give 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, in the partial block, for digit 4 in the tens place, it's from 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. For digit 8, it's from 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times. So, yes, tens place: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, but since we're only considering page numbers, 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit, so we can ignore that. So, from 100-488, the hundreds digit cycles through 1, 2, 3, and 4. Let's see: 100-199: hundreds digit is 1 (100 times), 200-299: hundreds digit is 2 (100 times), 300-399: hundreds digit is 3 (100 times), and 400-488: hundreds digit is 4 (89 times, since 488-400+1=89). Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, for the hundreds place, digit 4 appears 89 times, and digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each digit place.\n\nFor digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91. So, there are 91 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- 488 pages, so units digit cycles every 10 pages. 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, each contributing 1 occurrence of each digit 0-9. So, 48 times for each digit. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so each of 1-8 gets one more, making it 48 + 1 = 49 for 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each 100 pages contribute 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. 4 full hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. For digit 4 in the tens place, it's from 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 more, making 50. For digit 8, it's from 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 more, making 48. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- From 100-199: 100 pages, hundreds digit 1\n- 200-299: 100 pages, hundreds digit 2\n- 300-399: 100 pages, hundreds digit 3\n- 400-488: 89 pages, hundreds digit 4\nSo, 4 appears 89 times, 8 never appears. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n- 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n- 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place Analysis:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete blocks of 10 in 488 pages: 48 blocks.\n   - Each digit appears 48 times in the units place.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one more occurrence for digits 1-8.\n   - **Total for 4:** 48 + 1 = 49\n   - **Total for 8:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place Analysis:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete blocks of 100: 4 blocks (1-400), contributing 40 times for each digit.\n   - From 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8.\n     - Digit '4' appears 10 times (441-450).\n     - Digit '8' appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - **Total for 4:** 40 + 10 = 50\n   - **Total for 8:** 40 + 8 = 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place Analysis:**\n   - Pages 1-99: No hundreds digit.\n   - Pages 100-199: Hundreds digit '1' (100 times).\n   - Pages 200-299: Hundreds digit '2' (100 times).\n   - Pages 300-399: Hundreds digit '3' (100 times).\n   - Pages 400-488: Hundreds digit '4' (89 times).\n   - **Total for 4:** 89\n   - **Total for 8:** 0\n\n4. **Total Occurrences:**\n   - **Digit '4':** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - **Digit '8':** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for the digit 8. So, in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 pages. In each block, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, 48 blocks would give 48 fours and 48 eights. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does a 4 appear in the units place here? Yes, at 484. So that's one more 4. But 8 doesn't appear in the units place in this last partial block because 488 is the last page, and 488's units digit is 8, but that's in the tens place, right? Wait, no, 488 is 4-8-8, so the units digit is 8. So in the extra 8 pages, the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once. So, units place total: 48 + 1 = 49 fours, and 48 + 1 = 49 eights. So, in the units place, they are equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in every block of 100 numbers. So, for example, in 0-99, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times in 40-49, and similarly, 8 appears 10 times in 80-89. Now, how many full hundreds do we have in 488? Well, 400-488 is the last set. So, let's see:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each hundred. So, for each hundred, 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. How many full hundreds are there? 4 hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and then 400-488. Wait, that's five segments, but the first segment is 1-99, right? Wait, no, actually, 0 isn't used here because page numbers start at 1. So, maybe it's better to think of it as 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nSo, in each of the first four hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, for four hundreds, that's 4*10=40 fours and 40 eights. Now, the last segment is 400-488. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nIn 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for the tens digit, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. Wait, but 488 is the end, so does 488 include the 480-489 range? Well, 488 is within 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 times (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, actually, 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for each of these, so that's 9 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, each with tens digit 8. But in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times because 440 to 449 is 10 numbers. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, adding that to the previous 40 fours and 40 eights, we have 40+10=50 fours in the tens place, and 40+9=49 eights in the tens place. So, in the tens place, fours are more by 1.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears only in 400-488, which is 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? 89 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with hundreds digit 4. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total for hundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences:\n\n- Units place: 49 fours, 49 eights.\n- Tens place: 50 fours, 49 eights.\n- Hundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nAdding them up:\n\nTotal fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal eights = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nIn the units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48 each. Then, the last partial ten is 481-488, which includes 484, so one more 4, and 488 has an 8 in the units place, so one more 8. So, units: 48+1=49 fours, 48+1=49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. For the first four hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), that's 4*10=40 each. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, tens place: 40+10=50 fours, 40+9=49 eights. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly in 400-488, so 89 fours, 0 eights. Correct.\n\nSo, total fours: 49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal eights: 49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I feel like that might be too high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place, in 400-488, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 10 fours, 9 eights. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1 four and 1 eight, so 48 each. Then, the last partial ten, 481-488, includes 484 (units digit 4) and 488 (units digit 8). So, 1 more four and 1 more eight. So, units: 49 each. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\nFours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nEights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so 400 to 488 is 89 pages. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, the total fours are indeed 188, and eights are 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nBut let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the number of fours and eights separately and see if the difference is 90.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider each digit place separately and sum them up.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nUnits place:\n\nTotal numbers: 488.\n\nNumber of times each digit appears in units place: For each digit 0-9, it appears floor(488/10) = 48 times, plus an extra for the remaining 8 pages if the digit is <=8. Wait, no, actually, it's a bit different.\n\nWait, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(N/10).\n\nIf d <= (N % 10), then add 1, else add 0.\n\nBut since we're starting from 1, not 0, the formula is a bit different. Wait, maybe it's better to calculate it as:\n\nFor units digit, the number of times digit d appears from 1 to N is:\n\nIf N >= 10, then:\n\nNumber of complete decades: floor((N)/10).\n\nEach decade contributes 1 occurrence of d in the units place.\n\nThen, in the incomplete decade (if any), check if d is <= (N % 10). If yes, add 1.\n\nBut since we're starting from 1, the first number is 1, not 0, so the first decade is 1-10, which is a bit different.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to think that from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers, but starting from 1, so 1-10 has units digits 1-0.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to adjust the formula.\n\nThe formula for the number of times digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is:\n\ncount = (N // 10) * 1 + min(max(d - (N % 10), 0), 1)\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's take N=488.\n\nNumber of complete decades: 488 // 10 = 48.\n\nIn each complete decade, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. But since we start counting from 1, the first decade (1-10) has units digits 1-0, so digit 0 appears once, and digits 1-9 appear once each. Similarly, each subsequent decade will have each digit 0-9 once in the units place.\n\nBut wait, when N=488, the last incomplete decade is 481-488, which has units digits 1-8. So, for digit 4, in the incomplete decade, does 4 appear? Yes, at 484. So, in the incomplete decade, digit 4 appears once. Similarly, digit 8 appears once at 488.\n\nSo, for digit 4 in units place:\n\nComplete decades: 48, each contributing 1, so 48.\n\nIncomplete decade: 1 occurrence.\n\nTotal: 49.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8:\n\nComplete decades: 48, each contributing 1, so 48.\n\nIncomplete decade: 1 occurrence (at 488).\n\nTotal: 49.\n\nSame as before.\n\nNow, for the tens place:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to N can be calculated as:\n\ncount = (N // 100) * 10 + something.\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to think that for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, digit d appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many full hundreds? 4 full hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399). Each contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 each.\n\nThen, the last partial hundred is 400-488. In this range, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for digit 4 in the tens place, it appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 fours.\n\nFor digit 8 in the tens place, it appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 eights.\n\nSo, total tens place:\n\nFours: 40 +10=50.\n\nEights:40 +9=49.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nDigit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). So, 89 fours.\n\nDigit 8 never appears in the hundreds place in this range, so 0 eights.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\nFours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nEights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, so the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not missing something. For example, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with hundreds digit 4, so 89 fours. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 440-449 is 10 fours, and 480-488 is 9 eights. So, 10 fours, 9 eights. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 49 each. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete decades (480 numbers) and a partial decade (481-488).\n   - Each complete decade contributes 1 four and 1 eight in the units place: 48 each.\n   - In the partial decade (481-488), the units digits include 4 (at 484) and 8 (at 488): 1 each.\n   - **Total in units place:** 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred.\n   - For the first four hundreds (1-399), each contributes 10 fours and 10 eights: 40 each.\n   - In 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - **Total in tens place:** 50 fours, 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **Fours:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Eights:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, 488 is a three-digit number, so maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nLet me start by calculating how many times the digit 4 appears in each place. \n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks and a partial block of 8 pages (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8). In each full block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial block from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. Here, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, specifically from 40 to 49, and then every 100 numbers after that. So, in each 100-number block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 consecutive numbers. Let's see how many such blocks there are in 488. \n\nFrom 1 to 100: 40-49 is one block, so that's 10 times.\nFrom 101 to 200: 140-149 is another block, another 10 times.\nFrom 201 to 300: 240-249, another 10 times.\nFrom 301 to 400: 340-349, another 10 times.\nFrom 401 to 488: Now, 440-449 would be the next block, but 488 is less than 500, so 440-449 is within 401-488. That's another 10 times.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's 10 times. So, in total, how many blocks? Let's count: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 times. So 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, from 401-488, the block 440-449 is included, but 488 is beyond 449, so that's fine. So, total 50 times for the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so that's 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Again, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, similar to 4, in 488 pages, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? \n\nNumber of full blocks of 10: 48, as before. Each contributes one 8, so 48 times. Then, the partial block from 481 to 488: the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once here. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's calculate how many times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nFrom 1-100: 80-89 is one block, 10 times.\nFrom 101-200: 180-189, another 10.\nFrom 201-300: 280-289, another 10.\nFrom 301-400: 380-389, another 10.\nFrom 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 =9).\n\nWait, let me check: 480,481,...,488. So that's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 (first block) + 10 + 10 +10 +9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, 4's total 187, and 8's total 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 times. Correct because 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, and the last partial block (481-488) doesn't have a 4 in units, so 48.\n\nTens place: From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct because 488-400+1=89.\n\nSo, 48+50+89=187.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so that's one more 8. So, 48+1=49.\n\nTens place: From 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 10 each, and 480-488 contributing 9. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, as 800 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, 49+49=98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 187 -98=89.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. From 1-100: 80-89 is 10 numbers, correct. 101-200: 180-189, another 10. 201-300:280-289, another 10. 301-400:380-389, another 10. Then 401-488:480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 49. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, we have 5 blocks of 10, so 50, correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place, correct.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - In every block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.  \n   - There are 48 full blocks of 10 in 488 pages, contributing 48 occurrences.  \n   - The last partial block (481-488) doesn't include a 4 in the units place.  \n   - Total: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.  \n   - There are 5 such blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488), each contributing 10 occurrences.  \n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 numbers.  \n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Similar to 4, 8 appears once every 10 numbers.  \n   - 48 full blocks contribute 48 occurrences.  \n   - The last partial block (481-488) includes 8 in the units place.  \n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.  \n   - There are 4 full blocks contributing 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.  \n   - Total: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.  \n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**  \n187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nLet me start by calculating how many times the digit 4 appears in each place. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). In each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial block, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the tens digit is 4 for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many such blocks are there in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full blocks and then 88 extra numbers. Each full block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 times 10 is 40. Now, in the last partial block, from 400 to 488, the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 440-449. That's another 10 numbers, so adding 10 more. So, total 4's in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nAdding them up: Units (48) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's printed are 187.\n\nNow, I need to do the same for the digit 8. Let's go through each place again.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks and 8 extra numbers. Each full block gives one 8, so 48. In the last partial block, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (at 488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block contributes 10 8's. How many full blocks of 100 are there? 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial block from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, it's from 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), so 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nAdding them up: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed are 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to miscount, especially in the partial blocks.\n\nFor 4's in the units place: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), units digits go from 1-8, so no 4. So, 48 units 4's.\n\nTens place for 4's: Each hundred block has 10 4's in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full blocks (each 10 numbers) contribute 48 8's. Then, in 481-488, the units digit 8 appears at 488, so one more, total 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred block contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 8's. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** Every 10 numbers have one 4. There are 48 full blocks of 10, contributing 48 4's. The last 8 numbers (481-488) don't add any, so total 48.\n- **Tens place:** Every 100 numbers have 10 4's in the tens place. Four full blocks (1-400) contribute 40.

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. So, for example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit appears once every 10 numbers. Now, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, in each set of 10, it's once. So, I can calculate how many full sets of 10 there are in 488 and then see how many 4's are in the units place.\n\nWait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, in each of the 48 full sets, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, there's one more 4 in the units place, making it 49 times total for 4's in the units place.\n\nNow, for the 8's in the units place. Similarly, each set of 10 has one 8 in the units place. So, that's 48 times from the full sets. In the last partial set, 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so there's one 8 in the units place, making it 49 times total for 8's in the units place. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for 488 pages, how does this break down? Let's see, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. So, for 4 full hundreds, that's 4 times 10, which is 40 for each digit. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Let's see, from 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; and so on up to 481-490, which is 8, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit in 481-488 is 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Wait, in 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; 421-430, 2; 431-440, 3; 441-450, 4; 451-460, 5; 461-470, 6; 471-480, 7; and 481-488, 8. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 488 is less than 490, so 481-488 is only 8 numbers, right? So, does that affect the count? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the tens place, for the range 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except for the last one, which might be cut short. But actually, 401-488 is 88 numbers. So, 88 divided by 10 is 8 full sets, so each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times except for the last one, which is 8, but since we're only going up to 488, the 8 in the tens place appears 9 times? Wait, no, let me check. \n\nWait, 401-410: 10 numbers, tens digit 0\n411-420: 10 numbers, tens digit 1\n421-430: 10 numbers, tens digit 2\n431-440: 10 numbers, tens digit 3\n441-450: 10 numbers, tens digit 4\n451-460: 10 numbers, tens digit 5\n461-470: 10 numbers, tens digit 6\n471-480: 10 numbers, tens digit 7\n481-488: 8 numbers, tens digit 8\n\nWait, so the tens digit 8 appears only 8 times in 481-488, right? Because from 481 to 488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for each of those. So, for the tens digit in the partial hundred (401-488), the digit 4 appears 10 times (in 441-450), and the digit 8 appears 8 times (in 481-488). \n\nSo, adding that to the full hundreds: for 4's in the tens place, it's 4 full hundreds times 10 each, which is 40, plus 10 in the partial hundred, making 50 times. For 8's in the tens place, it's 4 full hundreds times 10 each, which is 40, plus 8 in the partial hundred, making 48 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 48 times. So, the difference here is 50 - 48 = 2 more 4's than 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4. \n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. \n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each digit place:\n\n- Units place: 49 - 49 = 0\n- Tens place: 50 - 48 = +2\n- Hundreds place: 89 - 0 = +89\n\nSo, total difference is 0 + 2 + 89 = 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere.\n\nStarting with the units place: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, the last 8 numbers (481-488) have 4 and 8 each once, so 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For full hundreds (1-400), each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place, so 4 times 10 is 40 for each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (441-450) and 8 occurs 8 times (481-488). So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 8 = 48 for 8's. So, difference is +2.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0. Difference is +89.\n\nAdding up the differences: 0 (units) + 2 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 91. So, 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just check if there's another way to approach this, maybe by counting the total number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtracting.\n\nTotal number of 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal number of 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full sets (480 pages) + 8 extra pages (481-488).\n   - 4's in units place: 48 (from full sets) + 1 (from 484) = 49.\n   - 8's in units place: 48 (from full sets) + 1 (from 488) = 49.\n   - Difference: 49 - 49 = 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - Full hundreds (1-400): 4 sets, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's \u2192 40 each.\n   - Partial hundred (401-488): \n     - 4's in tens place: 10 times (441-450).\n     - 8's in tens place: 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n   - Difference: 50 - 48 = +2.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488: 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Difference: 89 - 0 = +89.\n\n4. **Total Difference:**\n   - Units: 0\n   - Tens: +2\n   - Hundreds: +89\n   - Total: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{91}"

    "text": " I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all positions (units, tens, hundreds) and how many times 8 appears, then subtract the two counts to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit position separately.\n\nFirst, the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? That's 488 divided by 10, which is 48 full sets, with 8 remaining numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times, plus one more in the remaining 8 numbers (which is 484). So, total 49 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place: The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 40-49. Similarly, from 101-200, it's 140-149, and so on. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? That's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place, so 4*10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). The tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, but wait, 401-488 includes 440-449 as part of it. So, that's another 10 occurrences. So, total in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., up to 8 for 481-490, but since we stop at 488, it's 481-488. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is within 401-488, so that's 10 more. So, total 50 in tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place.\n\nUnits place: Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and then in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 for numbers like x80-x89. Each hundred contributes one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4*10=40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me see. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 8, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems right.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 49 + 49 is 98, but I thought maybe the hundreds place would have some, but no, since 488 is less than 800. So, total 8's are 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, as I thought. So, 40 + 9 = 49 in tens place. Units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus 488, which is one more, so 49. So, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but in the units place, from 1-488, how many times does 8 appear? Let's see: every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus the last partial set from 481-488, which includes 488, so that's one more 8 in the units place. So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, from 1-400, each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 8, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49 in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full tens (1-480), each contributing one 4, so 48. Then from 481-488, the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: From 1-400, each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct.\n\nCounting 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full tens (1-480), each contributing one 8, so 48. Then from 481-488, the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: From 1-400, each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 8, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: No 8's, as the book ends at 488. So, 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** For every 10 numbers, '4' appears once. There are 48 full sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 '4's. The last partial set (481-488) adds one more '4' (484). Total: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** In each hundred, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). With 4 full hundreds, that's 40 '4's. The last partial hundred (401-488) includes 440-449, adding 10 more. Total: 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, '4' appears in the hundreds place for 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to '4', '8' appears once every 10 numbers. 48 full sets give 48, plus one in 488. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** Each hundred has 10 '8's in the tens place. 4 full hundreds contribute 40. The last partial hundred (401-488) includes 480-488, adding 9 '8's. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No '8's since the book ends at 488. Total: 0.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by considering each digit place one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, in pages 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each 10-page block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once as well. So, for the units place, the count of 4's and 8's should be the same, right? But wait, maybe not exactly, because the total number of pages isn't a multiple of 10. Let me check that later. For now, let me think about the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times, and the digit 8 appears 10 times as well. But again, since the total pages are 488, which is less than 500, I might have a partial hundred. Let me think about that.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: For pages 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so it doesn't contribute to any 4's or 8's. Starting from page 100, the hundreds digit becomes 1, so it's 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times, and 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, which is less than 500. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all.\n\nWait, so let me summarize:\n\n- Units place: For each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, total number of 10-page blocks in 488 pages is 48 full blocks (since 48*10=480) and then 8 extra pages (481-488). So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times (once per each block) plus maybe once more if 481-488 includes a 4 in the units place. Wait, 481-488: the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once more in the units place. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, 8's in units place: 48 times plus one more in 488, so 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nWait, but hold on, 488 is the last page, so the units digit is 8. So, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, yes, units place: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\n- Tens place: Each 100 pages, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, from 1-400, how many times do 4 and 8 appear in the tens place? Let's see, 1-400 is 4 hundreds. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40 times each. But wait, 400 is the last page of the 400s, so from 400-488, how does that affect the tens place? Let me think. From 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears in the 440-449 block, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in the 480-488 block, but only 9 times because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 pages. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the 480-488 range. But wait, that's only in the 400s. But earlier, from 1-400, each hundred had 10 occurrences of 4 and 8 in the tens place. So, from 1-399, 4 appears 40 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 40 times as well. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times, and the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. Tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times.\n\n- Hundreds place: As I thought earlier, 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so hundreds digit is 4 only.\n\nSo, now, let's sum up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- Each 10 pages, 1 occurrence of 4 and 8.\n- 488 pages mean 48 full decades (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n- In the 48 full decades: 48 4's and 48 8's.\n- In the extra 8 pages: units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n- So, total units: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred, 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n- From 1-399: 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), but wait, 400 is included in the 400s. So, from 1-399, it's 4 hundreds minus the last one? Wait, no, 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. So, 400 is included in the 400s. So, from 1-399, it's 4 hundreds minus the last one? Wait, maybe I should think differently. From 1-399, that's 399 pages, which is 3 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300) and then 301-399, which is 99 pages. Wait, maybe this approach is complicating things. Alternatively, from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n- From 400-488, which is 89 pages, the hundreds digit is 4, so 89 4's.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up:\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I think I did it right.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place Analysis:**\n   - Each set of 10 consecutive pages (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) has one '4' and one '8' in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full sets of 10 pages in 480 pages, contributing 48 '4's and 48 '8's.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one more '4' (484) and one more '8' (488).\n   - **Total in units place:** 49 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place Analysis:**\n   - Each hundred pages (e.g., 1-100) have 10 occurrences of '4' and '8' in the tens place.\n   - From 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, contributing 40 '4's and 40 '8's in the tens place.\n   - From 401-488, '4' appears 10 times (440-449), and '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - **Total in tens place:** 50 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place Analysis:**\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is '4', appearing 89 times.\n   - '8' never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89 '4's and 0 '8's.\n\n4. **Summing Up:**\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n   - **Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of times the digit 4 appears in each place and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place for 4's. In every set of ten consecutive numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each complete set, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNow, the tens place for 4's. In the tens place, a 4 appears in a block of ten numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes ten 4's in the tens place. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see, the first block is 40-49, which is one. Then 140-149, that's another. 240-249, another, and 340-349, another. Then, 440-449, which is another. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last block would be 440-449, right? Because 450-459, 460-469, etc., but 440-449 is within 488. So, that's five blocks in total. Each block contributes ten 4's, so 5 times 10 is 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 4's. Then 140-149: another 10, so 20. 240-249: 30. 340-349: 40. 440-449: 50. Yeah, that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place for 4's. The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but wait a second, does 400 count as one? Yes, because 400 is the first number with 4 in the hundreds place. So, 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's would be units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for 8's. Starting with the units place. Again, in every set of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten? 48 complete sets, as before, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once here. So, total 8's in units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place for 8's. In the tens place, 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block contributes ten 8's in the tens place. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: 80-89 is one, 180-189 is another, 280-289 is another, 380-389 is another. Then, 480-489 would be another, but since the book only goes up to 488, that's only 480-488, which is nine numbers. So, the last block is incomplete.\n\nSo, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute ten 8's, so that's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all nine numbers (480-488), so that's nine 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, is that correct? Let me check. 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's. 180-189: another 10, total 20. 280-289: 30. 380-389: 40. Then, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, so from 480 to 488, that's nine numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, nine more, making it 40 + 9 = 49. So, yes, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place for 8's. The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's are units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, for 4's, I got 187. So, the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: Each ten numbers contribute one 4. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) don't have a 4 in the units place, so total units 4's: 48.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49: 10, 140-149: 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, 440-449: 10. That's five blocks, each contributing 10, so 5\u00d710=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: Each ten numbers contribute one 8. 48 complete sets, so 48. Then, the last 8 numbers (481-488) have an 8 in the units place (488), so one more, total 49.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389:10. That's four blocks, 4\u00d710=40. Then, 480-488: nine numbers with 8 in the tens place, so 9. Total tens 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: No 8's, as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 187 4's minus 98 8's is 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all numbers correctly, especially in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for 8's, 480-488 is nine numbers, so nine 8's in the tens place. That also seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place for 8's. The last set is 481-488. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 8 appears once in the units place here, which is 488. So, that's correct, adding one more to the 48 from the complete sets, making it 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place of 4's, in 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear, so no additional 4's there beyond the 48 from the complete sets.\n\nSo, I think my counts are correct. Therefore, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - In every set of ten numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of ten in 488 pages (488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n   - 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - There are five such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488.\n   - This range includes 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - In every set of ten numbers, 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - 48 complete sets contribute 48 occurrences.\n   - The last partial set (481-488) adds one more 8 (at 488).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Four complete blocks contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - The partial block 480-488 contributes nine 8's.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (book ends at 488).\n   - 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** 89 more 4's are printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Maybe I should separate the counting of 4's and 8's into these different digit groups.\n\nLet me start by thinking about how often the digits 4 and 8 appear in each position: units, tens, and hundreds. For each position, I can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, in the units place, the digit 4 will appear once every 10 numbers, and the same goes for 8. Now, I need to figure out how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488 pages.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider each digit place separately for all numbers from 1 to 488. Let's start with the units place.\n\nUnits place:\n- For 4: Every 10 numbers, there's a 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n- Let's calculate the number of complete tens in 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra numbers. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the 4 in the units place occurs once more (484). So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Similarly, for 8: Every 10 numbers, there's an 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n- Again, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once more (488). So total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nHmm, so in the units place, 4 and 8 each appear 49 times. So, they are equal here.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nTens place:\n- For 4: In the tens place, 4 appears in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range. Let me check how many times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\n- Each set of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, in 1-100, 40-49: 10 times. Similarly, 101-200: 140-149: another 10. 201-300: 240-249: another 10. 301-400: 340-349: another 10. Then, 401-488: 440-449: another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50 times.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure. From 1-488, how many hundreds are there? Let's see:\n\n- 1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10\n- 101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10\n- 201-300: 240-249 \u2192 10\n- 301-400: 340-349 \u2192 10\n- 401-488: 440-449 \u2192 10\n\nSo that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place:\n\n- 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\n- 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10\n- 101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10\n- 201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10\n- 301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10\n- 401-488: 480-488 \u2192 9\n\nSo, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So total 4*10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, so 4 appears 50 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 49 times. So, 4 is ahead by 1 here.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nHundreds place:\n- For 4: The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\n- For 8: The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, 4 is way ahead here.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- For 4: 48 full tens (1-480) gives 48, and 484 in 481-488 adds 1, so 49. Correct.\n- For 8: Similarly, 48 full tens and 488, so 49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- For 4: 5 sets of 10, so 50. Correct.\n- For 8: 4 sets of 10 (1-400) and 9 in 480-488, so 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- For 4: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89. Correct.\n- For 8: None, since 800 is beyond 488. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n- 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n- 8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the hundreds place would have more 4's, but let me check if I counted correctly.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so yes, 89 times 4 appears there.\n\nAnd for 8, since the book ends at 488, there's no page 800, so 0 times.\n\nSo, the total counts seem correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers from 1 to 488. By analyzing each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), we find that 4 appears 188 times and 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

So, for the units place, I can calculate how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488 pages and then see how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nWait, but 488 isn't a multiple of 10. So, I need to handle the remaining pages after the last complete set of 10. Let me calculate the number of complete tens and the remainder. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete sets of 10 and 8 extra numbers (481-488). \n\nIn each complete set of 10, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, for 48 sets, that's 48 times each. Now, looking at the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, so they're equal in the units place.\n\nNow moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred.\n\nSo, how many hundreds do we have? 488 pages mean we have four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so we have four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred (401-488). \n\nIn each full hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So, for four full hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each. Now, looking at the partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), up to 8 (481-490). But since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times? Wait, no, the tens digit is the second digit from the right, so in 481-488, the tens digit is 8 for all those numbers. So, from 480-489, the tens digit is 8, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480 isn't in our range because we start at 401. Wait, no, 401-488 includes 480? No, 401 is the start, so 480 would be within 401-488, right? Wait, 480 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the partial hundred. But wait, 480 is part of the 401-488 range, so yes, it's included. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in each full hundred, and in the partial hundred, does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see, 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8. So, 4 in the tens place would be 401-410, right? Wait, no, 401 is 4 0 1, so the tens digit is 0. Then 410 is 4 1 0, so tens digit is 1. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nIn the range 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 would occur in 440-449, but wait, 440 is within 401-488, right? 440 is 440, which is less than 488. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 449 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, in the partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 4*10 + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 4*10 + 9 = 49 times, because in the partial hundred, 8 appears 9 times (from 480-488). Wait, but earlier I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, but 480 is included, so it's 9 numbers. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the partial hundred. Therefore, total tens place: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nWait, let me double-check. For the full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, etc.), each has 10 instances of 4 and 8 in the tens place. So, 4 full hundreds give 4*10=40 for each. Then in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total for tens place: 4's = 40 +10=50, 8's=40 +9=49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, which doesn't contribute. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; 400-488, it's 4. So, the hundreds digit is 4 only in 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 +1=89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.\n\nUnits place:\n- 488 /10 =48 with remainder 8. So, 48*1=48 for each digit. Then in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, 48+1=49 each. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each full hundred contributes 10 times for each digit. 4 full hundreds give 40 each. Then in 401-488, 4 in tens place occurs 10 times (440-449), and 8 occurs 9 times (480-488). So, 40+10=50 for 4's, 40+9=49 for 8's. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49+50+89=188\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 complete sets, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 and 8.\n   - Remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 4 and 8 once each.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - 488 has 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 occurrences.\n   - Partial hundred (401-488):\n     - 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 4\u00d710 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (at page 4). From 11-20, it's page 14, and so on.\n\nSo, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra pages (481-488). In each complete set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear here? Yes, at 484. That's one more. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 in the tens place occurs in sequences like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, etc. Each of these sequences has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such sequences are there up to 488?\n\nLet's see: The first sequence is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10. Then 240-249, another 10. Then 340-349, another 10. Now, what about 440-449? That would be another 10, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, right? 449 is less than 488, so that's another 10. So that's five sequences, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is 10, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, and 440-449 is 10. That's five sets, each with 10, so 50 4's in the tens place. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? 48 complete sets (since 48*10=480) and then 8 extra pages (481-488). In each complete set, one 8, so 48. In the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in sequences like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these is 10 numbers. So, how many such sequences are there up to 488?\n\nFirst sequence: 80-89 (10 numbers). Second: 180-189 (10). Third: 280-289 (10). Fourth: 380-389 (10). Now, 480-489 would be another sequence, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, the 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, but from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all except 489, which isn't included. So, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit is 8 for all these 9 numbers. So, that's 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, how many sequences do we have? The first four sequences are complete (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 8's, and the last partial sequence (480-488) contributing 9 8's. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. In the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, no 8's there. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484). So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems right.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 complete sets, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in 481-488, units digit 8 appears once at 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10*4 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting the tens place for 8's, is 480-488 correctly accounted for? The tens digit is 8, so from 480 to 488, inclusive, that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, yes, 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nAnother way to check: For 8's in the tens place, the number of times 8 appears is the number of times the tens digit is 8. So, for each hundred, like 0-99, 100-199, etc., the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times. So, in 0-399, that's 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 times. So, total 40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, we have 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nAnd for the hundreds place, 4's are from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** For every 10 consecutive numbers, '4' appears once in the units place. There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 '4's. In the last 8 numbers (481-488), '4' appears once (at 484). Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** '4' appears in sequences like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such sequences (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 '4's. Total: 5 * 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, there are 89 numbers, each with '4' in the hundreds place. Total: 89.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to '4's, there are 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 '8's.

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me think about how to count the number of 4's and 8's in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, there's one 4 and one 8. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488). In each full block, there's one 4 and one 8, so for 48 blocks, that's 48 4's and 48 8's. Now, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, there's a 4 in 484 and an 8 in 488. So, that's one more 4 and one more 8. So, in the units place, total 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. So, so far, the count is equal.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, in each block of 100, there are 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. Now, how many full hundreds are there in 488? That's 4 (since 4*100=400). So, for each of these 4 blocks, we have 10 4's and 10 8's. So, that's 4*10=40 4's and 4*10=40 8's. Now, beyond 400, we have pages 401 to 488. Let's see how many numbers are in this range: 488 - 400 = 88 pages. Now, the tens digit in this range goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, for the tens digit, we need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nFrom 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles through 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Each digit appears 10 times except for the last one, which might be less. Wait, no, because 488 is the end, so for tens digit 8, it's from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, how does that affect the count?\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in the tens place beyond 400. So, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410 (10 numbers), 1 for 411-420 (10 numbers), 2 for 421-430 (10), 3 for 431-440 (10), 4 for 441-450 (10), 5 for 451-460 (10), 6 for 461-470 (10), 7 for 471-480 (10), and 8 for 481-488 (8 numbers). So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in the 440-449 range, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times (since 488 is included, but 480 is the start). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. Therefore, in the tens place beyond 400, we have 10 4's and 9 8's.\n\nSo, adding this to our previous counts: total 4's in tens place are 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50. Similarly, total 8's in tens place are 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I made a mistake. From 1-400, each hundred block contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 blocks would be 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, from 401-488, as I said, 440-449 gives 10 4's, and 480-488 gives 9 8's. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50, and 8's:40 +9=49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present from page 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, there are no hundreds digits. From 100-488, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, let's see how many times each digit appears in the hundreds place.\n\nFor hundreds digit 1: pages 100-199, which is 100 numbers. So, 1 appears 100 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, hundreds digit 2: pages 200-299, 100 times.\n\nHundreds digit 3: pages 300-399, 100 times.\n\nHundreds digit 4: pages 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, we're interested in the count of 4's and 8's in the hundreds place. So, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, adding this up: total 4's in hundreds place:89, and 8's:0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's and 8's across units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:50\n\nHundreds place:89\n\nTotal 4's =49 +50 +89= 188\n\nTotal 8's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:49\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal 8's=49 +49 +0=98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems a bit high. Let me go through each place again.\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) contribute one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, units place: 49 4's and 49 8's. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: From 1-400, 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 40 each. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. The 4 in the tens place occurs from 440-449, which is 10 times. The 8 in the tens place occurs from 480-488, which is 9 times. So, total 4's in tens place:40 +10=50, and 8's:40 +9=49. That adds up correctly.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 never appears, so 0. So, total 4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nAdding up: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188 4's.\n\nFor 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n- 48 full blocks (480 pages) give 48 4's and 48 8's.\n- The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 and one 8.\n- **Total:** 49 4's, 49 8's.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n- 4 blocks (400 pages) give 40 4's and 40 8's.\n- From 401-488, 440-449 adds 10 4's, and 480-488 adds 9 8's.\n- **Total:** 50 4's, 49 8's.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- 400-488 contributes 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n- No 8's appear in the hundreds place.\n- **Total:** 89 4's, 0 8's.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by thinking about how many times each digit appears in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit appears once every 10 numbers. Now, since the book has 488 pages, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488). \n\nWait, but when considering the units place, each complete set of 10 contributes one 4 and one 8. So, in the units place, each complete set of 10 has exactly one 4 and one 8. So, for 48 complete sets, that's 48 4's and 48 8's in the units place. Then, I need to check the remaining 8 pages (481-488). The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in these, there's one 4 and one 8. So, adding that, the units place contributes 48 +1 =49 4's and 48 +1=49 8's. So, in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So, for each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. Wait, no, actually, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. For example, from 1-100, the tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) and then 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), ..., up to 9 (90-99). So, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for every 100 pages.\n\nSo, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds do we have? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 4's and 40 8's in the tens place. \n\nNow, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488). The tens digits here go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). Wait, let me list them:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 481-488 is 8 pages with tens digit 8. So, in the tens place, how many 4's and 8's are there?\n\nLooking at the tens digits in 401-488:\n\n- 440-449: tens digit is 4. But wait, 401-488 includes 441-450 as tens digit 4? Wait, no, 441-450 would have tens digit 4, but 401-410 is 0, 411-420 is 1, etc. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 441-450, which is 10 pages, but wait, 488 is only up to 488, so 441-450 is within 401-488. So, that's 10 pages with tens digit 4. So, 10 4's in the tens place here.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, the tens digit is 8 in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 pages? Wait no, 480 is included, so 480-488 is 9 pages. Wait, but 480 is page 480, then 481-488 is 8 more pages, so total 9 pages with tens digit 8. Wait, but 480 is included, so the tens digit is 8 starting at 480. So, from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 pages. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in 480-488. Wait, but earlier I thought 481-488 is 8 pages, but 480 is also included, so 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me recount:\n\n- 480: tens digit 8\n- 481: 8\n- 482:8\n- 483:8\n- 484:8\n- 485:8\n- 486:8\n- 487:8\n- 488:8\n\nThat's 9 pages, so 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, but wait, 440 is included in 401-488, so that's 10 pages with tens digit 4.\n\nSo, in the tens place, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), we have 10 4's and 9 8's.\n\nAdding that to the 4 complete hundreds, which had 40 4's and 40 8's in the tens place, the total in the tens place would be 40 +10=50 4's and 40 +9=49 8's.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because in the 4 complete hundreds, each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would be 4*10=40 each. Then, in the remaining 88 pages, we have 10 4's and 9 8's, so total 50 4's and 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 401-488. Yes, 440 is page 440, so that's included. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the digits.\n\nFirst, units place: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nTens place:50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nHundreds place:89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 +50 +89= 49+50=99 +89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nTotal pages:488.\n\nUnits digit cycles every 10. So, 488 /10=48 full cycles, with 8 remaining pages.\n\nEach full cycle has one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48*1=48 4's and 48 8's.\n\nRemaining 8 pages:481-488. Units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, one 4 and one 8. So, total units:48+1=49 each.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40 each.\n\nRemaining 88 pages (401-488):\n\nTens digits:40-49: tens digit 0, then 50-59:1, etc., up to 480-488:8.\n\nWait, no, the tens digit in 401-488 is from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place:\n\n- Tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449:10 pages, so 10 4's.\n- Tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488:9 pages, so 9 8's.\n\nSo, total tens place:40+10=50 4's, 40+9=49 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n400-488:89 pages with hundreds digit 4. So, 89 4's, 0 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for the remaining 88 pages. Let me check again.\n\nIn 401-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I add up the total 4's and 8's, I get 188 and 98 respectively, so the difference is 90.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by counting the number of 4's and 8's separately in each digit place.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nTotal number of 4's: floor(488/10)=48, plus if the remainder is >=4, add 1. Since 488 mod 10=8, which is >=4, so 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: floor(488/10)=48, plus if remainder >=8, add 1. Since 8>=8, so 48+1=49.\n\nSo, units place:49 each.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)=4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in tens place: floor(488/100)=4, each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40. In the remaining 88 pages, tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 40+9=49.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: pages 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's.\n\nNumber of 8's: zero, since the book doesn't go beyond 488.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but another way to check: maybe using a formula or a different counting method.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit place, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10)=48, plus if 488 mod 10 >=4, which it is (8>=4), so 48+1=49.\n\nSame for 8's: floor(488/10)=48, plus if 488 mod 10 >=8, which it is, so 48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)=4, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 40+10=50.\n\nNumber of 8's: floor(488/100)=4, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. In the remaining 88 pages, tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/1000)=0, but since 488 >=400, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's.\n\nNumber of 8's: zero, since 488 <800.\n\nSo, adding up, same as before:188 4's and 98 8's, difference of 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, 488 is a three-digit number, so maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI think I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each block, 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear here? Yes, at 484. So that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, in each block of 100, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many full blocks of 100 are there in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full blocks. So, 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (400-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 400-488, the tens digit is 0 for 400-409, 1 for 410-419, ..., up to 8 for 480-488. Wait, but we're looking for when the tens digit is 4. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449. That's 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 occurrences. So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but hold on. 488 is less than 500, so the last block is 400-488. So, from 400-488, how many numbers have 4 in the tens place? It's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So yes, that's 10. So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these 89 numbers. So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Again, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. Similar to 4's, in each block of 100, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, 4 full blocks of 100 (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contribute 10, so 4\u00d710=40. Now, in the last partial block, 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers (including both 480 and 488). So, that's 9 occurrences. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 400-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, when the tens digit is 8, it's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. When counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 4 full blocks of 100, each contributing 10, so 40, and then in 400-488, 9 more. So, 49. Units place is 49 as well, so total 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full blocks (1-480) each contributing 1, so 48, plus in 481-488, 484 has a 4, so 1. Total 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each 100 has 10, so 4 blocks (1-400) contribute 40, then in 400-488, 440-449 is 10. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full blocks (1-480) each contributing 1, so 48, plus 488, so 1. Total 49.\n\n- Tens place: 4 blocks (1-400) each contributing 10, so 40, plus in 400-488, 480-488 is 9. So, 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting the tens place for 4's, from 400-488, is it 10 numbers? Yes, 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nAnd for 8's, in the tens place, from 400-488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 480 is included and 488 is the end. So, 9 numbers, not 10. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, another thought: when counting the units place, from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see, every 10 numbers, so 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 times, plus one more in the last partial block if 484 is within 481-488, which it is. So, 49 times. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place, same logic: 48 full blocks, plus 488, so 49.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can think of a smaller example to test my approach. Let's say a 20-page book. How many 4's and 8's would there be?\n\nPage numbers 1-20.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\nUnits place: 4,14 \u2192 2 times.\n\nTens place: 40-49, but we only go up to 20, so 0.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 2.\n\nCounting 8's:\n\nUnits place: 8,18 \u2192 2 times.\n\nTens place: 80-89, but we only go up to 20, so 0.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 2.\n\nSo, difference is 0. Hmm, but according to my method, let's see:\n\nUnits place 4's: 20 /10 = 2, plus in 1-20, 4 appears at 4 and 14, so 2. Correct.\n\nTens place 4's: 0, since 40-49 is beyond 20.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 2.\n\nSimilarly, 8's: units place 2, tens and hundreds 0. So, 2.\n\nDifference 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: 50 pages.\n\n4's:\n\nUnits: 4,14,24,34,44 \u2192 5 times.\n\nTens: 40-49 \u2192 10 times.\n\nHundreds: 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 5 +10 =15.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits: 8,18,28,38,48 \u21925 times.\n\nTens: 40-49: 8's in tens place would be 80-89, but we only go up to 50, so 0.\n\nHundreds:0.\n\nTotal 8's:5.\n\nDifference:15-5=10.\n\nWait, according to my method:\n\nUnits place 4's: 50 /10 =5, correct.\n\nTens place 4's: 10 (from 40-49), correct.\n\nUnits place 8's:5, correct.\n\nTens place 8's:0, correct.\n\nSo, difference 10. That seems correct.\n\nSo, my method works for smaller numbers, so I think it's correct for 488 pages.\n\nThus, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - 488 / 10 = 48 full blocks, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - In the last partial block (481-488), 484 has a 4, adding 1.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - 488 / 100 = 4 full blocks, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - In 400-488, 440-449 adds 10 more.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, 8 appears once.\n   - 488 / 10 = 48 full blocks, contributing 48.\n   - In 481-488, 488 adds 1.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - 488 / 100 = 4 full blocks, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - In 400-488, 480-488 adds 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place (800-899 exceeds 488).\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's in each digit place. For the units place, how often does 4 appear? Well, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that would be 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, the last group might not be complete. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so the last group is 480-488, which includes 484, 488, but the 4 in the units place would only be at 484, right? So actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit 4 appears 49 times because 488 is included, but does 488 have a 4 in the units place? No, it's 8. So maybe it's 48 times. Wait, let me think again. From 1 to 480, each group of 10 has a 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 to 8, so no additional 4's. So units place 4's: 48.\n\nNow, the tens place. How often does 4 appear in the tens place? Every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So in each block of 100, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So from 1 to 400, that's four blocks of 100, so 4 x 10 = 40 times. Then from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., up to 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit is 8 for 481-488. So in the 400-488 range, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 440-449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. So that's an additional 10 times. So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. How often does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So that's 89 times. So total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in units place. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so 480-488 includes 484, which is a 4 in the units place. So actually, it's 49 times? Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48 times, and then in the last group, 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. So units place 4's: 49.\n\nTens place: from 1 to 400, each 100 has 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40. Then from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nHundreds place: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but earlier I thought 187, now 188. Wait, let me recount.\n\nWait, from 1 to 488, units digit 4: every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But in the last partial ten, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. So units place 4's: 49.\n\nTens place: from 1 to 400, 4 x 10 = 40. Then 440-449: 10 more, so 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then in the last partial ten, 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. So units place 8's: 49.\n\nTens place: from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Well, every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each, so 10 times per 100. So from 1 to 400, that's 4 x 10 = 40 times. Then from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: from 1 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, but 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, let me check units place 8's again. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then in the last partial ten, 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. So yes, units place 8's: 49.\n\nTens place: from 1 to 400, 4 x 10 = 40. From 401 to 488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So total tens place 8's: 49.\n\nSo total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place 8's: 49, tens place 8's: 49, so total 98. But wait, let me check the tens place again. From 1 to 400, 4 x 10 = 40. Then from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So 40 + 9 = 49. So yes, 49.\n\nSo total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but I'm getting 98 for 8's and 188 for 4's. So the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the 4's or 8's.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49 times.\n\nTens place: 50 times.\n\nHundreds place: 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49 times.\n\nTens place: 49 times.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 98.\n\nSo the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I did the hundreds place correctly for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for 8's, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0.\n\nWait, but let me think about the tens place for 8's again. From 401 to 488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So that's 9 times. So 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to make off-by-one errors. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488 / 10) = 48, but since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is greater than or equal to 4, we add 1, so 49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: floor(488 / 10) = 48, and since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is equal to 8, we add 1, so 49.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488 / 100) = 4, so 4 x 10 = 40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (488 - 400 = 88), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNumber of 8's: floor(488 / 100) = 4, so 4 x 10 = 40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nNumber of 8's: 0.\n\nSo adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check: from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0.\n\nSo the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 188 - 98 = 90, so yes.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** Every 10 numbers have one 4. There are 48 full groups of 10, contributing 48 fours. The last group (481-488) includes 484, adding one more, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens place:** Every 100 numbers have 10 fours. From 1-400, there are 4 sets, contributing 40 fours. From 401-488, 440-449 adds 10 fours, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, there are 89 numbers with 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 fours.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8. There are 48 full groups, plus 488, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens place:** From 1-400, 4 sets contribute 40 eights. From 401-488, 480-488 adds 9 eights, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can sum them up for each digit and then compare the totals.\n\nStarting with the units place: For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit appears once every 10 numbers. Similarly, in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers, like from 1 to 100, each digit in the tens place appears 10 times (e.g., 0 in 1-9, 1 in 10-19, etc.). The same logic applies to the hundreds place, but it's a bit different because the hundreds digit only changes every 100 numbers.\n\nWait, but the book goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3, or 4. But since page numbers start at 1, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit only goes up to 4.\n\nNow, let me tackle the units place first. For each digit place, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10, but I have to be careful with the last partial set if the total isn't a multiple of 10. So, for the units place, how many times does 4 appear? From 1 to 488, each 10-number block has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, it's 48 full times, but wait, actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but the last partial set is 480-488, which includes 484, so that's one more 4. So, actually, it's 49 times. Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Each 10 pages contribute exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, there are 480 pages, which is 48 sets of 10, so 48 fours. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1-8, so no 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in units place is 48. Similarly, for 8's in units place, it's the same: from 1 to 480, 48 eights, and from 481-488, no 8 in units place. So, 48 eights.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For example, in 1-10, units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, 4 appears once, 8 appears once. So, every 10 pages, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, which is 48 sets of 10, each contributes one 4 and one 8. So, 48 each. Then from 481-488, which is 8 pages, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, that adds one more to each. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's: 48 +1 =49. So, they are equal in the units place. Hmm, so that's interesting.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, 481-488 is 8 pages: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, in the units place, 4 is at 484, and 8 is at 488. So, yes, each gets one more. So, units place: 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, how many times does it appear? From 40-49, that's 10 times. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place, from 80-89, that's 10 times. But wait, our book goes up to 488, so for the tens digit, in the hundreds place, we have to consider up to 488.\n\nWait, let me structure this. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in 1-100, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89). Similarly, in 101-200, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (140-149), and 8 appears 10 times (180-189). Same for 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is only 88 pages, so the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 pages. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488 is 9 pages, because 488-480=8, but inclusive, so 9 pages). Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 pages. So, in the tens place, in the 400-488 range, the digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, let me calculate the total for each digit.\n\nFirst, how many hundreds do we have? The book goes up to 488, so the hundreds digits are 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). So, for each hundred except the last one (400-488), the tens digits 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in their respective decades.\n\nSo, for hundreds 0,1,2,3 (i.e., 1-399), each has a full set where the tens digit 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 10 times. So, for each of these four hundreds, that's 10 each. So, 4 hundreds * 10 = 40 fours and 40 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 fours. The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 488 is the last page), so 9 eights.\n\nTherefore, total fours in tens place: 40 (from 1-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50 fours.\n\nTotal eights in tens place: 40 (from 1-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 49 eights.\n\nSo, in the tens place, there are 50 fours and 49 eights.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, 89 times, but wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these pages, so 89 fours.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total fours in hundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal eights in hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor eights:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal eights = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 49 fours, 49 eights. That seems correct because from 1-488, each digit appears 48 times in each 10 pages, and the last partial set adds one more for both.\n\nTens place: 50 fours, 49 eights. Because in the last hundred, 480-488 only has 9 eights in the tens place, whereas fours have a full 10 in 440-449.\n\nHundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights. Since 400-488 is 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, and no 8's there.\n\nAdding them up: 49+50+89=188 fours, and 49+49+0=98 eights. The difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 488-400+1=89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, so 89 fours. Correct.\n\nTens place in 400-488: 440-449 is 10 pages, so 10 fours. 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 eights. So, tens place: 40 (from 1-399) +10=50 fours, and 40 +9=49 eights.\n\nUnits place: 49 fours and 49 eights.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188 fours, 49+49=98 eights.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 pages, so 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there?\n\nThe sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The nth term is 10n-6. Wait, no, let's see: the first term is 4, which is 10*1 -6=4? No, that's not right. Alternatively, the nth term can be expressed as 4 + 10(n-1). So, 4 +10(n-1) \u2264488. Let's solve for n.\n\n4 +10(n-1) \u2264488\n10(n-1) \u2264484\nn-1 \u226448.4\nn \u226449.4, so n=49. So, 49 terms, meaning 49 fours in the units place. Same for eights: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's check how many terms. The nth term is 8 +10(n-1) \u2264488.\n\n8 +10(n-1) \u2264488\n10(n-1) \u2264480\nn-1 \u226448\nn \u226449. So, 49 eights in the units place. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, for fours: in each hundred, 10 fours in the tens place, except the last hundred where it's 10 again (440-449). So, 4 hundreds (0-3) give 4*10=40 fours, plus 10 in the last hundred, totaling 50 fours.\n\nFor eights in the tens place: each hundred (0-3) gives 10 eights, so 4*10=40. In the last hundred, 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 eights. So, total 40+9=49 eights.\n\nHundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nSo, total fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought initially that the hundreds digit would only go up to 4, which it does, but I want to make sure I didn't miss anything. Also, I should check if I counted the hundreds place correctly. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. No 8's in the hundreds place because the book doesn't go beyond 488, so hundreds digit 8 would start at 800, which isn't present. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAnother way to check: total number of digits. Let's see, pages 1-9: 9 pages, 1 digit each: 9 digits.\n\nPages 10-99: 90 pages, 2 digits each: 180 digits.\n\nPages 100-488: 389 pages, 3 digits each: 1167 digits.\n\nTotal digits: 9 + 180 +1167=1356 digits.\n\nNow, total number of 4's:188, total 8's:98. So, 188+98=286 digits accounted for, but that's just a small part of the total. Wait, but maybe this isn't necessary for the problem, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about how many times each digit appears in each place.\n\nWait, another approach: for each digit place, calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) + (1 if 488%10 >=4 else 0). Wait, but 488/10=48.8, so floor is 48, and since 488%10=8 >=4, so 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488%10=8 >=8, so 48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)*10 + (if the last two digits >=40 and <50, then add 10, else if >=40, add the difference). Wait, maybe it's better to think of it as:\n\nFor the tens digit, the number of times 4 appears is:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: floor(488/100)=4 (since 4*100=400 <=488). Each complete hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nNow, the remaining pages: 488-400=88 pages. The tens digit in these 88 pages can be from 0 to 8 (since 488 is 488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so add 10. So, total fours in tens place:40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds:4, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40.\n\nRemaining pages:88. The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, add 9. Total eights in tens place:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears: from 400-488, which is 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nNumber of times 8 appears: since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0.\n\nSo, same as before: fours total 49+50+89=188, eights total 49+49+0=98. Difference is 90.\n\nI think this confirms my earlier calculation. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Analyze Each Digit Place Separately:**\n   - Consider the units, tens, and hundreds places individually to count occurrences of '4' and '8'.\n\n2. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 pages.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10 pages, contributing 48 '4's and 48 '8's.\n   - The last partial set (481-488) adds one more '4' (484) and one more '8' (488).\n   - **Total in units place:** 49 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n3. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - For '4': In each hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.), '4' appears 10 times in the tens place.

In 400-488, '4' appears 10 times (440-449).\n   - **Total for '4' in tens place:** 50.\n   - For '8': Similarly, in each hundred, '8' appears 10 times.

    "text": " Wait, 488 is a three-digit number, so I need to consider all three cases separately.\n\nLet me start by counting how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers. Similarly, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. Units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. How many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 full sets and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times from the full sets, plus one more time in the extra set (484). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, hold on, let me check that again. If I have 488 pages, the units digit cycles every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 480, that's 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 through 8, so 484 has a 4 in the units place, adding one more. So yes, 49 total 4's in the units place.\n\n2. Tens place: Similarly, for the tens digit, each 100 numbers have 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, from 1 to 400, there are 4 hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), ..., up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, how many 4's are there? From 440-449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but from 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 only once, from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, that's 10. So total tens place 4's: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, for the hundreds digit, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, let me confirm: 400 is the first number with 4 in the hundreds place, and 488 is the last. So, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to 4's, for every 10 numbers, the units digit 8 appears once. So, in 488 numbers, how many full sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place, adding one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: For the tens digit, each 100 numbers have 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, from 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 8 only once, from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 occurrences. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, hold on. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), ..., 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 8's in the tens place.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place, so 9. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. So, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place in 4's, from 440-449, that's 10 numbers, so 10. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, from 481-488, 484 has a 4 in the units place, so +1, total 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, units place: 48 full sets, 48, plus 488, so +1, total 49.\n\nTens place for 8's: 4 * 10 = 40 from 1-400, plus 9 from 480-488, total 49.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again for the tens place in 8's. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, correct? So, 9 8's in the tens place. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the hundreds place, 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. That seems right.\n\nWait, but when I add up the 4's, units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 188. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's, units (49) + tens (49) = 98. So, 98 8's.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place in 4's, from 440-449, that's 10 numbers, so 10 4's. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nUnits place: 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus 484, which is one more, so 49.\n\nSo, yes, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 48 full sets, 48, plus 488, so 49.\n\nTens place: 4 * 10 = 40 from 1-400, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49.\n\nSo, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u21d2 48 full sets of 10, contributing 48 fours.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 484, adding one more 4.\n   - Total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place.\n   - From 1-400: 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 fours.\n   - From 401-488: The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, contributing 10 fours.\n   - Total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - From 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, 48 full sets contribute 48 eights.\n   - The remaining numbers include 488, adding one more 8.\n   - Total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - From 1-400: 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 eights.\n   - From 401-488: The tens digit is 8 in 480-488, contributing 9 eights.\n   - Total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I think I should handle each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Maybe I should calculate how many times each digit (4 and 8) appears in each position and then sum them up. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. So, in 48 complete groups, that's 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4's, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8's. Wait, so they're equal here. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, no, 488 is included, so yes, 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, units place gives 49 each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, for each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 ten times (40-49), and 8 ten times (80-89). So, each digit appears 10 times per hundred. Now, how many complete hundreds do we have? From 1-488, that's four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, no, actually, 401-488 is part of the 400s, which is the fifth hundred, but it's incomplete because it only goes up to 488. So, for each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, same with 8. So, in four complete hundreds (1-400), that's 4 times 10, which is 40 for each digit. Now, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 440-449, that's 10 times. But wait, 488 is included, so does 440-449 fall within 401-488? Yes, 440 is within that range. So, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 in the tens place. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place, we have 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the 401-488 range. Therefore, total for tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place? For 4, it's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. For 8, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? No, because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding it all up: Units place gives 49 each, tens place gives 50 for 4's and 49 for 8's, and hundreds place gives 89 for 4's and 0 for 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 401-488. I said that 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (440-449). But 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 times. And 8 in the tens place is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: For the tens digit, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times. But in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once in the tens place (440-449) and 8 appears once (480-488, but only 9 times because it stops at 488). Hmm, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but when I calculated the tens place earlier, I thought of it as 401-488 having 88 numbers, but actually, 488 - 400 = 88, but since we start at 401, it's 88 numbers, but from 401 to 488 is 88 numbers, but 400 is included? Wait, no, 401-488 is 88 numbers. So, 401-488: 88 numbers. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? It's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times. And 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 10 and 9 respectively.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's in tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (440-449) = 50.\n\n8's in tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (480-488) = 49.\n\nThen, hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nUnits place: 49 each.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe using a formula or another method to ensure I didn't miss anything.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- Each digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place, except possibly the last partial group.\n\n- Total numbers: 488.\n\n- Number of complete groups of 10: floor(488 / 10) = 48 groups, with 8 remaining numbers.\n\n- Each group contributes 1 occurrence of 4 and 1 of 8 in the units place.\n\n- So, 48 * 1 = 48 for each digit.\n\n- Then, the remaining 8 numbers: 481-488. The units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488).\n\n- So, total units: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4's, same for 8's.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred.\n\n- For 488, how many complete hundreds? 4 (1-400).\n\n- So, in each complete hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, same for 8.\n\n- So, 4 * 10 = 40 for each digit.\n\n- Now, the last partial hundred: 401-488.\n\n- The tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n\n- For 4 in the tens place: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\n- For 8 in the tens place: 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\n- So, total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n- 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488.\n\n- So, 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's.\n\nNow, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think this is correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place: For every group of ten numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many groups of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). Each full group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire set of ten numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such set contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such sets are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds, each contributing one set of ten with 4 in the tens place. That's 4 sets, each giving 10 4's, so 4*10=40. But wait, the last hundred is 400-488, so the tens place goes from 0 to 8. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's correct, 4 sets, each contributing 10 4's. So, 40 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these 89 numbers, contributing 89 4's.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 40 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 40 is 89, plus 89 is 178. So, 178 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, each group of ten numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of ten, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once more. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for sets like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such set contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Now, how many such sets are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds, each contributing one set. So, 4 sets, each with 10 8's, so 4*10=40. However, in the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 8 only in 480-489, but since our book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers: 480-488. Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, does that mean that in the hundreds place, the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times instead of 10? Wait, no, because 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we're stopping at 488, it's 9. So, in the hundreds place, the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 (from 0-399) plus 9 (from 480-488). So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, actually, from 0-399, each hundred has one set of 80-89, so that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 8's, so 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds: 0. So, 49+49=98. Hmm.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? For each hundred, like 0-99, 100-199, etc., the tens digit 8 occurs in 80-89, which is 10 times per hundred. So, from 0-399, that's 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 times (since 480-489 is 10 numbers, but we stop at 488). So, 40+9=49, which matches what I had before.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, for 4's, I had 178, and 8's are 98. So, 178 - 98 = 80. So, there are 80 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me recount the 4's.\n\nUnits place: 48 full groups of ten, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), units digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once. So, 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes one set of ten where tens digit is 4, so 4 sets (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 4's, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50.\n\nWait, wait, earlier I had 40, but that was incorrect. Because in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 more. So, total tens place 4's: 40 (from 0-399) +10=50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)= 188.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial count. I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me see: Initially, I thought tens place 4's were 40, but actually, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 more, making it 50.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49+50+89= 188.\n\nNow, 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because earlier I had 178 4's, but now I'm getting 188. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the tens place for 4's: Each hundred from 0-99, 100-199, etc., has one set of ten where tens digit is 4, so 4 sets, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. So, 40+10=50. So, that's correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus in the last group 481-488, units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once, so 49.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nSo, 49+50+89= 188.\n\nNow, 8's: Units place, 48 full groups, 48, plus in the last group, 481-488, units digit 8 appears once, so 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds, 40, plus in 400-488, tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9, making 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 80, but now it's 90. So, I must have made a mistake in my initial counting of the tens place for 4's.\n\nLet me confirm again. For the tens place of 4's:\n\nFrom 0-399, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4*10=40.\n\nIn 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 40+10=50.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if in 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers, correct.\n\nWait, 488-400+1=89, yes.\n\nSo, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, 49 units, 50 tens, 89 hundreds: 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\n8's: 49 units, 49 tens, 0 hundreds: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nHmm, so the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again.\n\nIn the tens place for 8's: Each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds, 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more. So, 40+9=49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 80, but now I'm getting 90. So, I must have made a mistake in my initial counting. Let me check the 4's again.\n\nWait, in the tens place for 4's, from 0-399, it's 4 sets, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. So, 40+10=50. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 full groups, 48, plus in 481-488, units digit 4 appears once, so 49.\n\nHundreds place: 89.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer was 80 before, but now it's 90. Let me see if I can find where I went wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check: From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 numbers, each with 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Let me think again: Each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds, 40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. So, 50 total.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I initially thought 80, but now I'm getting 90. Let me try another approach to confirm.\n\nAnother way to count the number of times a digit appears is to consider each digit position separately and calculate how many times each digit appears.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nFor any digit d (where d \u2260 0), the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to N is given by:\n\nNumber of times = (N // 10) * 1 + min(N % 10, d)\n\nWait, but actually, for each digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place up to N is:\n\nIf d < current units digit of N, then (N // 10) + 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use a formula.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit position, the count can be calculated as follows.\n\nLet me try to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in units place from 1 to 488.\n\nEach 10 numbers contribute one 4. So, 488 // 10 = 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48.\n\nThen, the remainder is 488 % 10 = 8.\n\nSo, in the last partial group, numbers 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once.\n\nTotal units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in tens place.\n\nEach 100 numbers contribute 10 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, 488 // 100 = 4 full hundreds.\n\nEach full hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nNow, the remainder is 488 % 100 = 88.\n\nSo, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more 4's.\n\nTotal tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in hundreds place.\n\nThis is from 400 to 488, which is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n\nSo, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of times 8 appears in units place from 1 to 488.\n\nEach 10 numbers contribute one 8. So, 488 // 10 = 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48.\n\nRemainder is 8, so in the last partial group (481-488), units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once.\n\nTotal units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of times 8 appears in tens place.\n\nEach 100 numbers contribute 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, 488 // 100 = 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40.\n\nRemainder is 88, so in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 480-489 is 10 numbers, but we stop at 488).\n\nSo, 9 more 8's in the tens place.\n\nTotal tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of times 8 appears in hundreds place is zero, since 800 > 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because initially I thought it was 80, but now I'm confident it's 90. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial counting by not accounting for the extra 10 in the tens place for 4's. So, the correct answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nLet me start by counting how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and then do the same for 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 pages. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times (once per each block of 10). Similarly, 8 appears 48 times. But wait, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the 49th block, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8. So, the digit 4 appears once more (at 484), and 8 appears once more (at 488). So, total units place: 49 times for 4 and 49 times for 8. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. From 1-480, there are 48 blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 each. Then, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8. So, in units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the difference in the units place is zero.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. In the tens place, the digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit goes from 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89). Now, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 full hundreds would give 4*10 = 40 times for 4. Similarly, 40 times for 8. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0-8. So, the tens digit goes from 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), ..., up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? It appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times. \n\nSo, total for the tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 (from 401-488 for 4) = 50 times for 4. For 8, it's 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49 times. So, the tens place contributes 50-49 = 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only non-zero from page 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, which doesn't count. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. \n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this book. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total for the hundreds place: 89 times for 4, and 0 times for 8. So, that's a difference of 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each digit place:\n\n- Units place: 49 - 49 = 0\n- Tens place: 50 - 49 = 1\n- Hundreds place: 89 - 0 = 89\n\nAdding these up: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 488 pages, so in units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears equally except maybe the last partial set. As I calculated earlier, 48 full tens blocks, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once, 8 appears once. So total 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens digit. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digits go up to 8, so 4 in tens place is 440-449, which is 10 times, so 40+10=50 for 4. For 8 in tens place, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49 for 8. So, 50-49=1 more 4 in tens place. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 pages, the hundreds digit is 4, so 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place, so 0. So, difference of 89.\n\nAdding up: 0 (units) +1 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place calculation for 401-488. Let me check again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit cycles 0-8, each appearing 10 times except the last one, which might be less. Wait, no, actually, from 400-409, tens digit is 0; 410-419, it's 1; and so on up to 480-488, which is tens digit 8, but only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's from 440-449, which is exactly 10 numbers, so 10 times. For 8 in the tens place, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred. So, total for tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) +10=50 for 4, and 40 +9=49 for 8. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm thinking, is the hundreds digit from 400-488 exactly 89 pages? Let's calculate: 488 - 400 +1 =89. Yes, that's correct. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188.\n\nTotal number of 8's is 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again: 49 units for 4, 50 tens for 4, 89 hundreds for 4. So, 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. For 8's: 49 units, 49 tens, 0 hundreds. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. That seems correct.\n\nI think that's the right answer. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Analyze Each Digit Place Separately:**\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - In every block of 10 numbers, each digit (0-9) appears once in the units place.\n     - There are 48 complete blocks of 10 in 480 pages, contributing 48 '4's and 48 '8's.\n     - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one more '4' (at 484) and one more '8' (at 488).\n     - Total: 49 '4's and 49 '8's in the units place.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - In every block of 100 numbers, each digit (0-9) appears 10 times in the tens place.\n     - Four complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 '4's and 40 '8's.\n     - From 401-488, the tens digit '4' appears 10 times (440-449), and '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n     - Total: 50 '4's and 49 '8's in the tens place.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - The hundreds digit is '4' from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages.\n     - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place.\n     - Total: 89 '4's and 0 '8's in the hundreds place.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Appearances:**\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n3. **Determine the Difference:**\n   - Difference = Total '4's - Total '8's = 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' appears 90 more times than the digit '8' in the page numbers.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place one by one. For each place (units, tens, hundreds), I can calculate how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every set of ten consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles through 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears once (at 4), and 8 appears once (at 8). Similarly, in 11-20, 4 appears once (at 14), and 8 once (at 18). \n\nNow, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and a partial set of 8 numbers (481-488). So, for the units place, in each complete set, both 4 and 8 appear once. So, for 48 sets, that's 48 times each. Then, in the partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, they are equal, so no difference there.\n\nNext, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears ten times in a set of 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is ten times, and 8 for 80-89, also ten times. So, for each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears ten times, and 8 appears ten times.\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are four complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, both 4 and 8 appear ten times in the tens place. So, four hundreds would give 4*10 = 40 for each digit. Now, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit cycles through 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). \n\nWait, but in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 8 appears in this partial hundred. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 441-450, that's ten numbers, so 4 appears ten times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 481-490, but wait, our book ends at 488, so that's only 8 numbers (481-488). So, in the partial hundred, 4 appears ten times in the tens place, and 8 appears eight times (since 481-488 is eight numbers). \n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me check again. The partial hundred is 401-488, which is 88 numbers. The tens digits go from 0 to 8. For each tens digit, the number of times it appears is 10, except for the last one, which is 8 because we only go up to 488. So, for tens digit 4, it's 441-450, which is ten numbers. For tens digit 8, it's 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, that's 8 numbers (481-488). So, in the partial hundred, 4 appears ten times, and 8 appears eight times. \n\nSo, in the tens place, total 4's: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the partial hundred, so 50. Total 8's: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 8 in the partial hundred, so 48. So, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 48, so 4's are 2 more than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I did that correctly. Let me think again. Each complete hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, four hundreds give 40 each. Then, the partial hundred (401-488) contributes 10 4's (from 441-450) and 8 8's (from 481-488). So, yes, 4's total 50, 8's total 48. So, 4's are 2 more in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. \n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit can't be 8 because the book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4, 3, 2, or 1. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89, and the number of 8's is 0.\n\nWait, that's a significant difference. So, in the hundreds place, 4's are 89 more than 8's. But let me make sure. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Since the book doesn't go beyond 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor the units place:\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\nDifference: 0\n\nFor the tens place:\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 48\nDifference: +2 (4's have 2 more)\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\nDifference: +89\n\nSo, total differences:\nUnits: 0\nTens: +2\nHundreds: +89\nTotal: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91\n\nWait, but that seems too high. Let me check each step again because 91 seems like a lot, and I might have overcounted somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me recount. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, I had 50 4's and 48 8's, so 2 more 4's. Units place, they are equal.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91. Hmm, that seems correct, but I'm a bit surprised. Let me check each digit place again.\n\nUnits place:\n- Each ten has one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each.\n- The remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 once (488). So, total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, 8's: 48 +1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred has ten 4's and ten 8's in the tens place.\n- Four full hundreds: 4 * 10 = 40 each.\n- Partial hundred (401-488): tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n- 4 in the tens place: 441-450, which is ten numbers, so ten 4's.\n- 8 in the tens place: 481-488, which is eight numbers, so eight 8's.\n- So, total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50, 8's: 40 + 8 = 48. So, 50 vs 48, difference +2. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears from 400-488: 89 times.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 89 vs 0, difference +89.\n\nAdding up: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 for 4's, and 49 + 48 + 0 = 97 for 8's. So, 188 - 97 = 91. So, 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAnother way to check: total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal number of 8's is 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - For every 10 consecutive numbers, both '4' and '8' appear once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) contribute one '4' (484) and one '8' (488).\n   - Total '4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total '8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Difference: 49 - 49 = 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - In each set of 100 numbers, '4' and '8' each appear 10 times in the tens place.\n   - Four complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 each.\n   - The partial hundred (401-488) contributes 10 '4's (441-450) and 8 '8's (481-488).\n   - Total '4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total '8's in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48.\n   - Difference: 50 - 48 = +2.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - '4' appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 times.\n   - '8' never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total '4's in hundreds place: 89.\n   - Total '8's in hundreds place: 0.\n   - Difference: 89 - 0 = +89.\n\n4. **Total Difference:**\n   - Units: 0\n   - Tens: +2\n   - Hundreds: +89\n   - Combined: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Maybe I should count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can make sure I don't miss any.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place one by one.\n\n1. **Units place for 4's:**\n   - In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. Here, 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - So, from 1 to 480, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 480 divided by 10 is 48. So, in each of these 48 groups, 4 appears once in the units place. That gives 48 times.\n   - Now, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once here as well (484).\n   - So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place for 4's:**\n   - In the tens place, 4 appears in a block of 10 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers.\n   - How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, each block is 100 numbers, so from 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488.\n   - From 40-49: that's one block, so 10 times.\n   - From 140-149: another block, another 10 times.\n   - From 240-249: another block, 10 times.\n   - From 340-349: another block, 10 times.\n   - Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8, so 40-49 would be 401-410, but wait, that's only 10 numbers. Wait, no, 401-410 is 10 numbers, but the tens digit is 0 in 401, 1 in 411, etc. Wait, actually, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8 again. So, the block where tens digit is 4 would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440 is beyond 488? No, 440 is less than 488, so that's another 10 times.\n   - Wait, but 401-488: the tens digits go from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, the tens digit is 4 in 441-450, which is 10 numbers.\n   - So, total tens place 4's: 10 (from 40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449) = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place for 4's:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 in all 89 of them.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400 to 488 inclusive is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, for the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. For the tens place, each hundred block (like 0-99, 100-199, etc.) has one block where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers each. So from 0-99: 40-49, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Plus the hundreds place 89, and units place 49, so total 49+50+89=188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's.\n\n1. **Units place for 8's:**\n   - Similar to 4's, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers, which is 48 groups of 10. So, in each group, 8 appears once, so 48 times.\n   - From 481 to 488, the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once (488).\n   - So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place for 8's:**\n   - In the tens place, 8 appears in a block of 10 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Let's see how many such blocks are in 488 pages.\n   - From 0-99: 80-89, 10 numbers.\n   - From 100-199: 180-189, another 10.\n   - From 200-299: 280-289, another 10.\n   - From 300-399: 380-389, another 10.\n   - From 400-488: The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but we only have up to 488, so that's 9 numbers. Wait, but 480 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (480: tens digit 8, units 0; 481: tens 8, units 1; up to 488: tens 8, units 8). So that's 9 numbers, not 10.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 (80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place for 8's:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that again. For the tens place, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So total tens place 8's: 49.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for the 8's in the tens place, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 9 8's there, plus the other 40 in the lower ranges, so 49 total.\n\nWait, but let me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nAnd 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\nTotal: 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 4's was only up to 488, but I think I counted that correctly as 89.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 480, there are 48 groups of 10, contributing 48 times. From 481-488, 4 appears once (484). Total: 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes 10 times. There are 5 such blocks (including 440-449 in 400-488). Total: 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 480, 48 times. From 481-488, 8 appears once (488). Total: 49.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block contributes 10 times, except the last block in 400-488, which contributes 9 times (480-488). Total: 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, there's one 4 and one 8. Therefore, the number of 4's and 8's in the units place should be the same unless the total number of pages isn't a multiple of 10. But since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then 8 extra pages (481-488). So, in the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times, and then in the remaining 8 pages, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times, and 8 appears 48 times plus one more time in the extra 8 pages, making it 49 times for 8. Wait, no, because the extra pages are 481-488, so the units digits are 1 through 8, so 8 appears once more. So, units place: 4's = 48, 8's = 49. So, 8's are one more than 4's in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers. So, in 488 pages, how many full hundreds are there? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each full hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for 4 full hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 times each. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 440-449, which is 10 times. And 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 times (since 488 is the last page). So, in the tens place, 4 appears 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50 times, and 8 appears 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49 times. So, in the tens place, 4's are 50, 8's are 49, so 4's are one more.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for numbers 100 and above. From 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, which doesn't count. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299 is 2; 300-399 is 3; 400-488 is 4. So, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, in the hundreds place, 4's are 89, and 8's are 0. That's a significant difference.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each place:\n\n- Units place: 4's = 48, 8's = 49\n- Tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49\n- Hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0\n\nSo, total 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units: 48 and 49, tens: 50 and 49, hundreds: 89 and 0. So, adding up:\n\n4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 187, and 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each place to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place: Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place for the first 480 pages, and then in 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears one more time, making it 49. So, 4's in units: 48, 8's: 49. That seems right.\n\nTens place: Each full hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. 4 full hundreds give 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, 440-449 is 10 times for 4, and 480-488 is 9 times for 8. So, 4's: 40 + 10 = 50, 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 4's: 89, 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187, and 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Difference is 89. That seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place for the first 480 pages.\n   - In pages 481-488, units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once more.\n   - **4's:** 48, **8's:** 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred. For 488 pages:\n     - 4 full hundreds (1-400) give 40 each.\n     - Pages 401-488: 440-449 (10 times for 4) and 480-488 (9 times for 8).\n   - **4's:** 50, **8's:** 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Only pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, totaling 89 times.\n   - **4's:** 89, **8's:** 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 187 - 98 = 89\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " I should probably count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately\u2014units, tens, and hundreds places. \n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a sequence of numbers. So, for example, in the numbers 1 to 10, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. But wait, actually, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly once in the units place every 10 numbers. \n\nNow, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. So, in each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for 8. So, in 48 groups, that's 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once more, and 8 appears once more. So, total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, 4 and 8 appear the same number of times. \n\nNext, I should check the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages beyond that (401-488). \n\nIn each of the 4 full hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for 4, and similarly 40 times for 8. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Let's see, from 401-409, the tens digit is 0; 410-419, tens digit is 1; 420-429, tens digit is 2; 430-439, tens digit is 3; 440-449, tens digit is 4; 450-459, tens digit is 5; 460-469, tens digit is 6; 470-479, tens digit is 7; and 480-488, tens digit is 8. \n\nSo, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and the digit 8 appears 9 times because 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is actually 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred. \n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. Tens place 8's: 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49. So, in the tens place, there are 50 4's and 49 8's. \n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. For each hundred, the hundreds digit is fixed. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist or is 0. From 100-199, hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4. \n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. \n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, the hundreds digit 8 never appears. So, 0 times. \n\nSo, hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0. \n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nStarting with units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So, 48 + 1 = 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 full hundreds give 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-8. For 4, it's 10 times (440-449), and for 8, it's 9 times (480-488). So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place: Only from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's. 8's in hundreds place: 0, since we don't reach 800. So, that's correct.\n\nAdding up: 4's total is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. 8's total is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place. Let me check again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? \n\nEach 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place: Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 full hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go up to 8. For 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. For 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. \n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. 8's: 0. \n\nSo, adding up: 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Difference is 90. \n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total groups of 10 in 488: 48 full groups and 8 extra numbers.\n   - 4's: 48 (from full groups) + 1 (from 481-488) = 49.\n   - 8's: 48 (from full groups) + 1 (from 481-488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - 4 full hundreds contribute 40 each.\n   - In the last partial hundred (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 appears 0 times.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. Units place: For every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, we take the integer part, which is 48. So, that's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial group, which is 481 to 488, the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, actually, it's 48 full groups plus one more, making it 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. Tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 488 is up to 488, which is the 400s. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. But wait, in the 400s, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 40-49 is within 400-488. So, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, actually, in the 400s, it's another 10 times, but wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 440-449 is within that. So, that's another 10 times. So, total tens place 4's would be 4*10 + 10 = 50? Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently.\n\nActually, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each 100 numbers, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers. So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 40-49 in the tens place would be 440-449, which is another 10 times. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 99 + 89 is 188? Let me check: 99 + 80 is 179, plus 9 is 188. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8:\n\n1. Units place: Similar to 4, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. But in the last partial group, 481-488, the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100. So, in each 100 numbers, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times. From 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, so 4*10=40 times. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, it's 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, plus one more in 484, so 49.\n- Tens: Each hundred contributes 10, so 4*10=40, plus in the 400s, 440-449 is another 10, so total 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 full tens, plus one in 488, so 49.\n- Tens: Each hundred contributes 10, so 4*10=40, plus in the 400s, 480-488 is 9, so total 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

    "text": " I should probably handle each of these cases separately.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), I can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place: In every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, we have 4 and 8 in the units place. Similarly, from 11-20, we have 14 and 18, and so on. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). In each full block, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place, so that's 48 times each. Now, in the partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). Therefore, in the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, so 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, that can't be right because 488 is included, so maybe the partial block is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, units place: 4's = 48 +1 =49, 8's=48 +1=49. So, same count in units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in the tens place, 4 appears in the numbers 40-49, 140-149, etc. Similarly, 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). Since we have 488 pages, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, does 4 appear in the tens place here? Yes, in 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10 times. So, total 4's in tens place would be 4*10 +10=50.\n\nWait, but wait, 401-488 is 88 pages, which is 400-488. So, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each hundred. So, in 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total 4's in tens place: 4*10 (from 1-400) +10 (from 400-488) = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: In each hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, in 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40 times. Now, in 401-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in 401-488. Therefore, total 8's in tens place: 4*10 +9=49.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. So, yes, 49 times for 8's in tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's 89 times because every number from 400 to 488 has 4 in the hundreds place. So, 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\nFor 8's in the hundreds place, well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 +50 +89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 +49 +0 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98 =90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each, and then the last partial block (481-488) adds one more 4 and one more 8, making it 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 40, plus in 401-488, 440-449, which is 10 more, so 50 total. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: 4 full hundreds, 40, plus in 401-488, 480-488, which is 9 times, so 49. Correct.\n\nIn hundreds place: 4's appear 89 times (400-488), and 8's never appear, so 0. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when I count the hundreds place, maybe I made a mistake. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 -400 +1=89. So, yes, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the hundreds place, since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never goes to 8, so 0. Correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach to confirm. Maybe using a formula or a different counting method.\n\nAnother way is to consider each digit place separately and calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nFor units digit:\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is given by:\nfloor(N/10) *1 + min(max(d, N%10 +1), 10) if d <= N%10 else 0\n\nWait, maybe that's more complicated, but let's try.\n\nFor units digit 4:\nfloor(488/10)=48, so 48 times, plus if 4 <= (488%10)=8, then add 1, so total 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for units digit 8:\nfloor(488/10)=48, plus if 8 <=8, add 1, so 49. Correct.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\nThe formula is a bit different. The number of times digit d appears in the tens place up to N is:\nfloor(N/100)*10 + extra.\n\nFor example, for 4 in tens place:\nfloor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. Now, the last partial hundred is 401-488, which is 88 numbers. The tens digit cycles every 10, so how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in the last partial hundred?\n\nThe last partial hundred is 400-488. The tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 40+10=50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in tens place:\nfloor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. The last partial hundred is 400-488, and the tens digit goes up to 8. So, 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, total 40+9=49. Correct.\n\nFor hundreds digit:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nNumber of times 8 appears in hundreds place: 0, since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, same as before, 4's total 188, 8's total 98, difference 90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n- There are 48 full blocks (480 pages) and a partial block of 8 pages (481-488).\n- 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n- 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n- For 4's: 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 10 in 440-449 \u2192 50\n- For 8's: 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 in 480-488 \u2192 49\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- 4's: 89 times (400-488)\n- 8's: 0 times\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place one by one. I'll calculate the number of times 4 appears in each place and do the same for 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, in every block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and similarly, 8 appears once. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 pages. So, in each of these 48 blocks, 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 fours. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, 4 and 8 appear the same number of times.\n\nMoving on to the tens place. In the tens place, 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers for 10 consecutive numbers (like 40-49), and similarly, 8 appears in 80-89. So, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? That's 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then a partial block from 401-488. In each complete block, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in each block, so 4 * 10 = 40 eights. Now, looking at the partial block from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, in the tens place, 4 appears once in 400-409, but wait, 401-488 includes 400-409? No, wait, 401-488 is from 401 to 488, so the tens digit is 0 in 401-410, 1 in 411-420, and so on up to 8 in 481-490, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears from 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears once (from 400-409, but 400 is included in 401-488? Wait, 401 is the first page, so 400 isn't included. So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 401-410, but 401-410 would have tens digit 0, right? Wait, no, 401 has a tens digit of 0, 410 has a tens digit of 1. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each 100-number block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49), 8 for 10 numbers (80-89), etc. So, in 401-488, the tens digit ranges from 0 to 8. So, for the tens digit being 4, how many times does it occur? It occurs in 401-410? No, wait, 401 has tens digit 0, 410 has tens digit 1. Wait, no, 401 is 4 0 1, so the tens digit is 0. The next set where the tens digit is 4 would be 440-449. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440 is within 401-488, so that's 10 fours in the tens place. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought in each 100-number block, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, in the first 400 pages (1-400), there are 4 blocks of 100, so 4 * 10 = 40 fours in the tens place. Then, in 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. Tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. So, 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. And for 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that seems right.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, right? So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. What about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because 800 is beyond 488. So, the hundreds digit 8 appears zero times.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nStarting with units place: in 488 pages, how many times does 4 appear in the units digit? For every 10 pages, it appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, units 8's: same logic, 48 + 1 = 49. So, that's correct.\n\nTens place: For each 100 pages, 4 appears 10 times in the tens digit (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So, in 400 pages, that's 4 times 10 = 40 fours and 4 times 10 = 40 eights. Now, from 401-488, which is 88 pages, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 fours. And 8 in the tens place is from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 eights. So, total tens 4's: 40 + 10 = 50, and tens 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. So, that's correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 fours. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because 800 is beyond 488. So, 0 eights.\n\nAdding up: 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all the digits correctly. For example, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so that's correct. In the tens place, I considered 440-449 as 10 fours, which is correct, and 480-488 as 9 eights, which is correct. Units place seems correct too.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. The answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - In every 10 numbers, 4 and 8 each appear once.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks of 10 in 488, contributing 48 fours and 48 eights.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488).\n   - Total: 49 fours and 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - In every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - In 400 pages, this contributes 40 fours and 40 eights.\n   - From 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 fours and 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 fours and 0 eights.\n\nAdding them up:\n- Total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, actually, 488 is a three-digit number, so pages 100 to 488 are three-digit. \n\nI think I should calculate the number of times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. I'll consider each digit position one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every set of ten numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. So, how many complete blocks of ten are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of ten and an extra 8 pages. In each complete block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 would have a 4 in the units place. So that's one more. So total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the incomplete block, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 is within this range, so that's one more 4. So yes, 49 in total for the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. Here, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, let's see. The hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're dealing with page numbers up to 488, the hundreds digit can go up to 4, but for the tens digit being 4, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for pages 40-49), 1 (140-149), 2 (240-249), 3 (340-349), and 4 (440-449). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So 5 x 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 5 blocks, each with 10 4's, so 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but wait a second. When the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit 4 would start at 440, but does it go up to 449? Yes, that's correct. So 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 50 in total.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. But the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages, so each of these 89 pages has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through each digit place: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in each block of ten, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete blocks of ten are there in 488? 48 complete blocks, as before, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the incomplete block from 481-488 has units digits from 1 to 8, so 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So that's one more. So total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each with one 8, so 48. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) include 488, which has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more, making it 49. Correct.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the block. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except possibly the last one if it's incomplete.\n\nSo, how many such blocks are there?\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, all within 488.\n- 180-189: 10 numbers, within 488.\n- 280-289: 10 numbers, within 488.\n- 380-389: 10 numbers, within 488.\n- 480-489: But our book ends at 488, so only 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nWait, so for the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each has 10 8's in the tens place. That's 4 blocks x 10 = 40.\n\nThen, the last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me double-check. From 80-89: 10 8's. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. Then 480-488: 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no pages where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me add that again. Units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. Each block of 100 has a block where the tens digit is 8, right? So, for example, in 0-99, it's 80-89; in 100-199, it's 180-189; 200-299: 280-289; 300-399: 380-389; 400-488: 480-488.\n\nSo, each of these blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place except the last one, which contributes 9 because we stop at 488. So, that's 4 blocks with 10 each, and 1 block with 9. So, 4x10=40, plus 9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the 8's in the tens place were 49, but let me confirm: 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier when calculating 4's, I had 188 4's. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 4's are printed 90 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because sometimes it's easy to miscount.\n\nLet me recalculate the number of 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 +89=188.\n\nAnd for 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 =90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check that again.\n\nThe hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488 inclusive. So, 488 -400 +1=89 pages. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, 4's: each block where tens digit is 4, from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5x10=50. Correct.\n\nUnits place:49. Correct.\n\nSo, 4's:188.\n\n8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98.\n\nSo, difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there any other place where 8's could appear? Like in the hundreds place, but since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit is only up to 4, so no 8's there. So, yes, 98 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about page numbers, sometimes the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, but in that case, the hundreds digit isn't printed, right? So, for example, page 4 is just '4', not '004'. So, when considering the hundreds digit, only pages 100-488 have a hundreds digit, so pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit, so no 8's there.\n\nWait, but in the tens and units places, 8's can appear regardless of the hundreds digit. So, my earlier calculations should be correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe using a formula or a different approach to confirm.\n\nAnother way to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position is:\n\nFor units place: For each digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place up to N is floor(N/10) + (1 if the last digit is >=d else 0).\n\nSimilarly, for tens place: floor((N/10)/10) * 10 + min(max(N%100 - 10*(d) +1, 0), 10).\n\nWait, maybe that's more complicated, but let me try.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit position, calculate how many times each digit appears.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to stick with my initial method.\n\nWait, for the units place, in 488 pages:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) = 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and then check the last partial ten. 488 mod 10 is 8, so the last ten is 481-488. In this, 484 has a 4 in the units place, so one more. So, 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's: floor(488/10)=48, and the last partial ten has 488, which is an 8, so 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nFor the tens place, for 4's:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in the tens place is calculated as:\n\nFor each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers. So, how many hundreds are there?\n\nFrom 0-99: 10 numbers with tens digit 4 (40-49)\n100-199: 10 (140-149)\n200-299:10 (240-249)\n300-399:10 (340-349)\n400-488: from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10. But wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5x10=50. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place:\n\nSimilarly, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, in 0-99:10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488: from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, that's 4 blocks with 10 each, and one block with 9, so 4x10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, 4's:50, 8's:49 in the tens place.\n\nIn the hundreds place:\n\nFor 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nFor 8's: There are no hundreds with 8 in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can think of another way to calculate this. Maybe using the formula for digit frequency.\n\nThe formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is:\n\ncount_units = (N // 10) + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\ncount_tens = (N // 100) * 10 + min(max(N % 100 - d*10 +1, 0), 10)\n\nAnd for the hundreds place:\n\ncount_hundreds = (N // 1000) * 100 + min(max(N % 1000 - d*100 +1, 0), 100)\n\nBut since N=488, which is less than 1000, the hundreds place calculation would be:\n\ncount_hundreds = (488 // 1000)*100 + min(max(488 % 1000 - d*100 +1, 0), 100)\n\nBut since 488//1000=0, it's just min(max(488 - d*100 +1, 0),100). For d=4, it's 488 -400 +1=89, so 89. For d=8, since 800 >488, it's 0.\n\nSo, applying this formula:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: (488//10)=48, and since 488%10=8 >=4, add 1:49\n- Tens: (488//100)=4, so 4*10=40. Then, 488%100=88. So, 88 -4*10 +1=88-40+1=49. So, min(49,10)=10? Wait, no, I think I'm misapplying the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I should refer to a standard digit counting method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to stick with my initial method since it's giving me consistent results.\n\nSo, I think I can be confident that the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we need to count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n### Counting the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes 1 occurrence of 4.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks of 10 in 488, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - The last partial block (481-488) includes 484, adding 1 more.\n   - Total: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n   - There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: \\(5 \\times 10 = 50\\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89.\n\nTotal occurrences of 4: \\(49 + 50 + 89 = 188\\).\n\n### Counting the digit 8:\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes 1 occurrence of 8.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks of 10 in 488, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - The last partial block (481-488) includes 488, adding 1 more.\n   - Total: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 complete blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), contributing \\(4 \\times 10 = 40\\).\n   - The last partial block (480-488) contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: \\(40 + 9 = 49\\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - There are no pages where the hundreds digit is 8.\n   - Total: 0.\n\nTotal occurrences of 8: \\(49 + 49 + 0 = 98\\).\n\n### Difference:\nThe number of 4's exceeds the number of 8's by \\(188 - 98 = 90\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"

    "text": " I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. For the units digit to be 4, the page number must end with 4. How often does this happen? Well, in every set of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so the digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many such sets are there? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then a partial set of 8 numbers (481-488). Each full set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the partial set from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the 4 appears once more. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 4 when the page number is between 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers long, so each contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 40-49, that's one; 140-149 is another; 240-249, another; 340-349, another; and 440-449, which is the fifth. So, 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, I need to check if 440-449 is entirely within 488 pages. Yes, since 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times 4 in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 when the page numbers are from 400-488. Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, it's from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's are 188.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. The units digit is 8 in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? Similar to the 4's, each set of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, the partial set from 481-488: the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Each full range (like 80-89) has 10 numbers, contributing 10 8's in the tens place. So, how many full ranges are there? From 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's four ranges, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Now, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, in this range, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, so total tens place 8's would be 40 (from the four full ranges) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 when the page numbers are from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's are 0.\n\nSo, total 8's are units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8. I had four full ranges (80-89, 180-189, etc.), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, so 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's are 188, total 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, for the 4's in the hundreds place: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nFor the 8's in the tens place: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10. That's four ranges, 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 more. So, 40+9=49. That seems right.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, yes, 9 numbers. So, 9 8's in the tens place there.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly for the tens place in 4's? I had 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems correct because 440-449 is within 488.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? So, 440, 441, ..., 449. So, yes, that's 10 numbers. So, 5 ranges, 10 each, 50.\n\nWait, but when I added up, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for 8's, units: 49, tens:49, hundreds:0, total 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in higher places, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me try another approach for cross-verification.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position separately.\n\nFor the units place:\n\n- For both 4 and 8, each digit appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear?\n\nNumber of complete decades (sets of 10) in 488 is 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490, but wait, 488 is less than 490, so actually, it's 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490) but since 488 is less than 490, the last decade is incomplete. Wait, no, 488 is 48 full decades (each of 10 numbers) plus 8 more numbers (481-488). So, for units digits, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times, and then in the last 8 numbers, digits 1-8 appear once each. So, for digit 4: 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly for 8: 48 +1=49.\n\nThat matches my earlier count.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nEach digit appears 10 times in each block of 100 numbers. So, for example, in 1-100, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place (10-19 have 1 in tens, ..., 90-99 have 9). So, in 1-400, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place?\n\nFrom 1-400, there are 4 blocks of 100 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each block has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 blocks * 10 = 40 times for each digit.\n\nBut wait, from 401-488, that's another 88 numbers. So, in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-409: tens digit 0) to 8 (480-488: tens digit 8). So, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here?\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0 (401-409), 1 (410-419), 2 (420-429), 3 (430-439), 4 (440-449), 5 (450-459), 6 (460-469), 7 (470-479), and 8 (480-488). Each of these is 10 numbers except the last one, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, for the tens digit 4, it's 10 numbers (440-449), contributing 10 4's. For the tens digit 8, it's 9 numbers (480-488), contributing 9 8's.\n\nSo, in the 401-488 range, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place for 4: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50.\n\nTotal tens place for 8: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49.\n\nThat matches my earlier counts.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-399, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3. So, 4 and 8 do not appear in the hundreds place here. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so 4 appears 89 times (as calculated earlier). 8 does not appear in the hundreds place at all, so 0.\n\nSo, total hundreds place for 4: 89.\n\nTotal hundreds place for 8: 0.\n\nAdding up, 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe 90 was high, but after cross-verifying, it seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct.\n\nAnother way: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades (each contributing 1 '4') and an additional 8 numbers (481-488) where '4' appears once. Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** '4' appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges, each contributing 10 '4's. Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, '4' appears in the hundreds place for 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to '4', '8' appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** '8' appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full ranges (each contributing 10 '8's) and an additional 9 numbers (480-488). Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No page numbers have '8' in the hundreds place. Total: 0.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** Subtract the total '8's from the total '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I should probably handle each digit place separately\u2014units, tens, and hundreds\u2014since the count of 4's and 8's might vary depending on their position.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place one by one. Maybe I can calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place, tens place, and hundreds place, and do the same for 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and an extra 8 pages. In each of these 48 blocks, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So that's 48 times each. Now, for the extra 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial block, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, adding that to the previous total, units place gives us 48 + 1 = 49 fours and 48 + 1 = 49 eights. Wait, so in the units place, they are equal? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so the units digits go up to 8, so 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So, yes, both get one more in the units place. So, units place gives 49 fours and 49 eights.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times every 100 pages, same with 8. So, how many hundreds do we have here? 488 pages mean 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). So, for each hundred, in the tens place, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times. So, 4 hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 fours and 40 eights. Now, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 440 to 449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 times. But wait, 488 is only up to page 488, so 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 fours. Similarly, 8 in the tens place would be from 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is 9 pages (480-488), so the tens digit is 8 for all these, which is 9 times. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 pages, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place. So, in the tens place, for the partial hundred, we have 10 fours and 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 fours and 40 + 9 = 49 eights.\n\nWait, let me make sure. From 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each ten's digit, it's 10 numbers except for the last one, which is only 9 (480-488). So, 4 in the tens place occurs once in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. 8 in the tens place occurs once in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So yes, 10 fours and 9 eights in the tens place for the partial hundred. So, total tens place: 50 fours and 49 eights.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. Wait, no, 300-399 is hundreds digit 3, and 400-488 is hundreds digit 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place gives 89 fours and 0 eights.\n\nWait, let me check that again. The hundreds digit is 1 for 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399 and 400-488. So, 300-399 is 100 pages, and 400-488 is 89 pages, so total hundreds digit 4 is 100 + 89 = 189 times. Wait, no, that's not right. Each page number has a hundreds digit, but for numbers less than 100, the hundreds digit is 0, right? So, in reality, the hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the number of times 4 appears in the hundreds place is from 400 to 488, which is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but since our book ends at 488, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere.\n\nStarting with units place: 488 pages, so 48 full tens and 8 extra pages. Each full ten gives one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 each. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 4*10=40 fours and 40 eights. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, 4 in the tens place occurs once (440-449), which is 10 pages, so 10 fours. 8 in the tens place occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 eights. So, total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 fours and 40 + 9 = 49 eights. That adds up correctly.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488), and 8 appears 0 times. So, 89 fours and 0 eights. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. That seems correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: For the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 4 appears a certain number of times. 1 appears 100 times (1-99, but actually, no, wait, the hundreds digit is 1 from 100-199, which is 100 pages. Similarly, 2 from 200-299, another 100, 3 from 300-399, another 100, and 4 from 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, yes, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages has one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks (480 pages), contributing 48 each.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 and one 8.\n   - Total: 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 pages has 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n   - Four complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 each.\n   - The last 88 pages (401-488) add 10 fours (440-449) and 9 eights (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 fours, 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488 (89 pages).\n   - The hundreds digit is never 8.\n   - Total: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- Fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- Eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
