    "text": " Correct. Now, onto counting the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me find how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, as 488-480+1=9). So, total eights in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that seems off because earlier, in units place, I had 49, and in tens place, 49, so total 98 eights. Let me check again. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 in tens place. So total eights: 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me check again because sometimes when counting, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount the number of 8's. Units place: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 8,18,...,488. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 in tens place. So, total eights: 49 +49=98. Fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The last number is 488, so how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full hundred block (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets of 10, which is 40 eights. Now, the next set would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 9 numbers: 480-488. So, that's 9 more eights in the tens place. So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188-98 is 90. But let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in the number of times a digit appears. Let me go through the fours again: Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for eights. Let me check again. When counting eights in the tens place, I considered 80-89, which is 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and then 480-488:9 numbers. So that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. That seems correct. Similarly, for fours, in the tens place, from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, giving 50 fours. So, that seems correct too. Therefore, the difference is 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8. So, how many sets? From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me recount the fours. Units place: 4,14,...,484. So, how many? From 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10,140-149:10,240-249:10,340-349:10,440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488:89 numbers. So, 89. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, for the eights. Units place:8,18,...,488. So, same as fours, 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, since 800+ is beyond 488. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, how many such numbers? Let's see. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9 (480,481,...,488). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. Correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block of 100 has 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - This is 89 numbers, so 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block of 100 has 10 occurrences, except the last which has 9.\n   - Total = 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in any page number up to 488.\n   - Total = 0.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,..., up to 488. The last occurrence in the units place is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but including 488, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 count? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits with 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check the counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98.

The last number with an 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The formula is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488).

    "text": " Yes, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. Let's count how many sets. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10*4 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, total eights: 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours and eights. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the units place for fours. Let me check again. Units place for fours: from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, yes, 49 fours in units place. Similarly, for eights in units place: 8,18,...,488. Last term is 488, so ((488-8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, that's correct. Tens place for fours: from 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 fours, so 50. For eights in tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. Hundreds place for fours: 400-488:89 numbers. Hundreds place for eights: none. So, fours total 188, eights total 98. Difference is 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (1s place):** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10. The number of terms is calculated as ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place (10s place):** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place (100s place):** 400-488. This range includes 89 numbers, each contributing a '4'.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place (1s place):** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place (10s place):** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place (100s place):** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's - Number of '8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Correct. Now, onto the number of 8's. I'll do the same process for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 would have 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place (480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 =9). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block, which only goes up to 488. So, let's break it down: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189:10. - 280-289:10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me verify the tens place for 8's again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. Similarly, for fours in the tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. So that's correct. And units place for fours: from 4,14,...484. How many? Let's see, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 full tens, but since 484 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, 49 fours in units place. Similarly, for eights in units place: 8,18,...488. 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, that's correct. So, the total fours are 188, eights are 98, so the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\text{ (full tens)} + 1 \\text{ (for 484)} = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   Each block of 100 contributes 10, and there are 5 such blocks up to 440-449.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   5 \\times 10 = 50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in 400-488.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n   \\]\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\text{ (full tens)} + 1 \\text{ (for 488)} = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.  \n   Each block of 100 contributes 10, and the last block contributes 9.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   Number of occurrences: 0\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference:**  \n\\[\n188 - 98 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

Let's count how many full sets we have. Each full set (like 80-89) has 10 numbers. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 40 eights. Then, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, in the tens place, we have 40 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, no, wait. When the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9.

Because 8,18,...,488: the first is 8 (which is 8), then 18 is 18, and so on. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488.

So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, that's 9 instead of 10 because 489 is beyond 488.

So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but we have to check if 488 is included. 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let's count how many sets of 100 have the tens digit as 8. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

The last occurrence in the units place is 488. So, how many? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers.

So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9.

So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that seems off because 49+49=98. But let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total 98. So, number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit again. For fours: units place, every 10 numbers, so from 4,14,...,484. How many? Let's see, 484 is the last one. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. For 8's: units place, 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 4 sets of 10, and one set of 9. 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90.

    "text": " Correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49.

But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Wait, so how many full blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page).

The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, 8,18,...,488. Let me check: 8 is the first, then every 10. So, 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets are there? 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me just double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that looks right. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me check: units place is 49, tens is 49, so total 98. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place, I included 480-488 as 9 numbers, right? Let me confirm: from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, yes, 9.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40 plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct. For the tens place of fours, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Units place, 49 fours. So, 188 total fours. For eights, units place 49, tens place 49, so 98. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't overcount in the units place for fours. Let me recount the units place for fours. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first is 4, then 14, 24,...,484. So, how many terms are there? The last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in the units place. That's correct. Similarly, for eights in units place, same logic: 8,18,...,488. 488 is 8 + 10*(n-1)=488 \u2192 10*(n-1)=480 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Now, tens place for fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each set is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Correct. For eights in tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, and the last set has 9 numbers (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, total fours:188, eights:98. Difference:90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

I'll do the same for each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,..., up to 488. How many? Let's see, the last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The count is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8.

Units place for fours: from 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place for fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets: 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. So, total fours:188.

So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8.

Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has a set where the tens digit is 8, which is 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89). So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that seems correct? Let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total eights:98. Now, the number of fours was 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., and in 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block which contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
