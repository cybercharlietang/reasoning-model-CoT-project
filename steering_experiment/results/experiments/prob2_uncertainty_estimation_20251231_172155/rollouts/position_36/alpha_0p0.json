    "text": " Yeah, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would be 49 numbers, but wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let's see: 8, 18, 28,..., 488. That's 49 numbers, so 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that right? Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me double-check. Units:49, tens:49, so total 98. That seems correct. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, we subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Yeah, that seems right. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers with 8 in the units place? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, 4 full blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98. That seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let me count how many full sets of 10 there are.

So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me check the units place for fours: from 4 to 484, that's 49 numbers, correct. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, so 50, correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, correct. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For eights: units place, 49, correct. Tens place: 49, correct. Hundreds place:0. So, 49+49=98 eights. 188-98=90.

Let me think: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive). So, the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) each have 10 eights in the tens place, and the last block has 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yes, that seems right.

Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so how many steps of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full steps, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let's count each block. 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480 to 488 is 9 numbers).

Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me check the units place for 4's: from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers, so that's 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers, correct. Tens place for 4's: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449, each 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours, correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours, correct. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488, which is 49 numbers, correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 eights, and the last block has 9, so 4*10 +9=49, correct. Hundreds place: none, correct. So, total fours:188, eights:98. Difference:188-98=90.

    "text": " Yeah, that seems right. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but let's check: 8,18,...,488. Each ten has one 8 in the units place. From 1-488, how many tens are there? 488 /10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8*49=392? Wait, no, because 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, starting from 8, the nth occurrence is at 8 + (n-1)*10. So, the last occurrence before 488 is when 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. Let me solve for n: 8 + 10(n-1) \u2264 488 \u2192 10(n-1) \u2264 480 \u2192 n-1 \u2264 48 \u2192 n \u2264 49. So, there are 49 eights in the units place. Wait, but 8 + 48*10 = 8 + 480 = 488, which is exactly the last page. So, that's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place for fours. When counting fours in the tens place, I considered 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 5 sets of 10, which is 50. That seems right. Similarly, for eights in the tens place, I had 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. That also seems correct. So, I think the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

The last one is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, every 10 numbers adds one. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, so that's 4 sets of 10, which is 40 eights. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is included, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so we don't count that. So, 4 sets: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes 10 eights, so 4*10=40. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (40) = 89. So, total eights are 89. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, fours are 188, eights are 89. The difference is 188 - 89 = 99. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours and eights. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 40, hundreds 0. 49+40=89. 188-89=99. Hmm, seems correct.

For eights, in the tens place, from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: each has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Units place: 8,18,...488. Since 488 is included, that's 49. So, 49+40=89.

That seems correct. So, number of fours is 188, number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for eights.

Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers add one more 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Let me count how many sets of 100 have the tens digit as 8. Each set (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers. From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189: 10. 200-299: 280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the end). Wait, so from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, and the last set (480-488) contributes 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's correct, 49. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Yeah, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, which would give 48 eights, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Each block from 80-89, etc., has 10 numbers. So, how many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? So, adding up, that's 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Units place: 49, tens:49, so total eights are 98. But earlier, for fours, I had 188. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. Let me recount the tens place for 8's. From 0-488, the tens digit is 8 in the following ranges: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, that's correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, fours are 188, so the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but I feel like I might have made a mistake because sometimes when counting, it's easy to miscount. Let me cross-verify. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position again. For 4's: units: from 4,14,...,484. How many? The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) +1. So, (488-4)=484, 484/10=48.4, floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 in units. Tens: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and how many blocks? From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, 4 in tens place occurs in 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks of 10, which is 50. So, 50 in tens. Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 in hundreds. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units: 8,18,...,488. So, same as before, 49. Tens: 80-89 (10),180-189 (10),280-289 (10),380-389 (10),480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds: none, so 0. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Number of 4's: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{484}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\)\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).  \n   - Number of blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449)  \n   - Number of 4's: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\)\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.  \n   - Number of 4's: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\)\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\( 49 \\) (units) \\( + 50 \\) (tens) \\( + 89 \\) (hundreds) \\( = 188 \\)\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Number of 8's: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\)\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).  \n   - Number of blocks: 5 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488)  \n   - Note: The last block (480-488) has 9 numbers.  \n   - Number of 8's: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\)\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Number of 8's: \\( 0 \\)\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\( 49 \\) (units) \\( + 49 \\) (tens) \\( + 0 \\) (hundreds) \\( = 98 \\)\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**  \n\\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

I'll do the same approach, looking at each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89 is the first block, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 489 is beyond 488. So, that's 5 blocks, but the last block only has 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) has 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's. For fours: units place: 4,14,...484. That's 484/10 = 48.4, but since we include 484, it's 49. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each block is 10, and there are 5 blocks, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units place: 8,18,...488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 eights, and the last block has 9 (480-488 is 9 numbers). So, 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total eights: 49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights. I think that's correct.

    "text": " Yep, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers, since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). Let me count each block: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check that again. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check again. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. So total eights: 49 + 49 = 98. Hmm, but wait, in the tens place, I had 49 eights, but let me make sure I didn't double-count or miss anything. For example, in the tens place, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 full decades (each contributing 10) and a partial decade contributing 9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. So that's correct. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me cross-verify. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me recount the hundreds place for fours. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 -400 +1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Then, tens place for fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these contributes 10, so 5 sets, which is 50. Units place for fours: every 10 numbers, starting at 4,14,...,484. How many? The last number is 484, which is 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For eights: units place:8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four contributes 10, and the last contributes 9, so 4*10 +9=49. So, 49+49=98 eights. Thus, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's in hundreds place.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, which would give 48 eights. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8 is the 8th number in 0-9, then every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? Each full hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 8.

Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 10*4 +9=49.

So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total:188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total:98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. And in the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of those is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Units place: every 10 numbers, so 488/10=48.8, so 49 occurrences. So, 49+50+89=188.

    "text": " Yeah, that seems right. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so how many 8's in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, meaning 48 eights, but wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. Wait, no, because 8,18,28,...,488. Let me count: from 0 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place. The first is 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count each block: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, for the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place.

So, tens place:49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. Difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, did I count the hundreds place correctly? For fours in hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Yes, because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. For eights in hundreds place: none, since 800 is beyond 488. Okay, that's correct. And in the tens place for fours: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. That's correct. For eights in tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, five sets, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. That's correct. Units place for both 4 and 8: both have 49 occurrences because from 4 to 484, that's 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers, and similarly for 8's up to 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place for both is 49. So, the counts seem accurate. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.

    "text": " Yeah, that seems right. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. So, counting how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, let's count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me confirm that. Units:49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. Yes. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Let me just go through this again to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. That seems correct. Wait, but let me check the tens place for 4 again. I thought each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, which is 10 numbers, and similarly in 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. So that's correct. For eights, in the tens place, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 49 in total. Yes, that seems right.

    "text": " Yes, that seems right. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is 488/10 = 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, let's count each block: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place:49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

    "text": " Yep, that seems right. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll go through each digit position again: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence? Let me check: starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds another 8 in the units place. So, 8,18,...,488. The total number is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is within range, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. So, how many sets are there? Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, check if 480-489 is within 488. 480-489 would be pages 480-489, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place here? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. Wait, but the tens digit is 8 only for 480-489, but since the book stops at 488, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, that's an additional 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 40, but now adding 9 more, so total 49. Hmm, that's different from my initial thought. Let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but earlier I thought units had 49, tens had 49, so total 98 eights. But let me double-check the tens place calculation. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of fours was 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours and eights.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units: 49 (as each 10 numbers have one 4 in units, up to 484, which is 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers)\n- Tens: 50 (each 100 has 10, from 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 5 sets of 10, which is 50)\n- Hundreds: 89 (from 400-488, which is 89 numbers)\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188\n\nFor eights:\n- Units: 49 (same logic, up to 488)\n- Tens: 49 (as calculated earlier)\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal eights: 49+49=98\n\nDifference: 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, that seems correct. I think I did it right.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers. The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 numbers, and the last range contributes 9 (since the book ends at 488). Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = **49**.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Yeah, that seems right. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, which would give 48 eights, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is included, so does that mean 49 eights in the units place? Let me list them: 8,18,28,...,488. The first is 8, and the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set. Let's count how many sets there are. Each hundred has one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, as 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 49+49=98. That seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me just double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yes, that seems correct.

There are 49 such numbers (from 4 to 484, inclusive).\n   \n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).

I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last one is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. Wait, but let me confirm: starting at 8, each 10 numbers adds one 8 in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? Wait, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of this. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such blocks we have. From 0-99: 80-89:10 numbers. From 100-199:180-189:10. From 200-299:280-289:10. From 300-399:380-389:10. From 400-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, that's 9 numbers because 480-488 is 9 numbers (including both ends). So, in the tens place, we have 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Wait, that's 98 eights. Wait, but earlier I thought the tens place was 49, units 49, so total 98. Now, let me double-check the tens place calculation. For the tens place, we have 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 in the tens place. Units place is 49, so total eights are 49+49=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, counting fours: units, tens, hundreds. Units: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, up to 484. So, 484 is the last one. The number of fours in units place is (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets: 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, eights: units place:8,18,...,488. So, (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours - 98 eights=90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again: is there any overlap where a page number might have both 4 and 8, but in different digit positions, but does that affect the count? No, because each digit is counted separately. So, for example, 48 is counted as a 4 in the tens place and an 8 in the units place, but each digit is counted individually. So, my counting should be correct. Therefore, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but the book only goes up to 488, so the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488).

Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " Yeah, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. That seems correct. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90.

    "text": " Yeah, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers are there? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no: 8,18,...,488. Let me check: 488 is the 49th number because 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10 => n = (488 -8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see if 480-489 is included, but since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 80-89:10 eights. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488: but wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), so how many eights in the tens place here? Let's see: 480-488: the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but earlier blocks have 10 each. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks with 10 each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4*10=40. Plus the 9 in 480-488. So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. Wait, but let me think again. The first four blocks (80-89, etc.) each have 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 eights. So total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 0-399, we have 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40+9=49. That seems correct. So, total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's recheck the fours: units, tens, hundreds. Units:49. How? From 4,14,...,484. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens:50. Because 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds:400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place. So, 89. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the units place for eights. Let me check again. The units place for eights: from 8,18,28,...,488. How many numbers? The last number is 488, which is 8 + (n-1)*10=488. So, n-1=(488-8)/10=480/10=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10,380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. Correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a big difference. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, I could calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position. For units place: For both 4 and 8, in each set of 10 numbers, each digit appears once. So, for 488 pages, how many full sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48 full sets, with 8 remaining numbers (481-488). So, for units place, 4 appears 48 times in the full sets, plus once in the remaining 8 numbers if 484 is included. Wait, 484 is within 481-488, so that's 49 times for 4. Similarly, 8 appears 48 times in the full sets, plus once in the remaining 8 numbers (488), so 49 times. So, units place:4:49,8:49. Correct. For tens place: Each set of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 and 10 where it's 8. So, for 488 pages, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100,101-200,201-300,301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, for tens place: For each full hundred, 10 fours and 10 eights. So, 4*10=40 for each. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), how many fours and eights in the tens place? For fours: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, 440-449 is fully included. So, 10 fours. For eights: 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, tens place: fours:40+10=50, eights:40+9=49. So, total fours in tens place:50, eights:49. Correct. For hundreds place: For fours, 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. For eights, there are no hundreds digits of 8 in 1-488, so 0. So, hundreds place: fours:89, eights:0. So, total fours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. Eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. So, the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.  \n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.  \n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 occurrences, and the last block contributes 9.  \n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.  \n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let me make sure. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-489:10. But our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights in the tens place, and the last set 480-488 contributes 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, did I count correctly in the tens place for eights? Let me recount. For the tens place, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So 4*10=40, plus 9 is 49. Yes, that's correct.

So, the total number of 8's in the tens place is 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and then 9 in 480-488. So, that's 4*10 +9=49.

Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but including 488, which is the 49th occurrence.

So, each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, but the last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9.

    "text": " Yep, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is within the page numbers, so yes, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of that. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8.

So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yep, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that's 98 eights. But wait, let me double-check. Units:49, tens:49, so total 98. Hmm, but I thought maybe I missed something. Let me recount the tens place. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, units:49, tens:49, total 98. So, number of eights is 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through the fours again. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. From 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488:89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. Now, eights: Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. That's (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.

So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-489 would be 10, but we only go up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me double-check: units 49, tens 49, so 49+49=98. Yes. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. Let me go through each digit place again. For fours: units place: from 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four is 10, last one is 9, so 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total eights: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four sets have 10 each, and the last set has 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Yeah, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number is 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's see: Each block from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, but the last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, how many eights in the tens place? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the Number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Total occurrences: 49 (from 4 to 484, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the Number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Total occurrences: 49 (from 8 to 488, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many full sets we have. Each 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9.

Wait, but when I count the units place, I had 49, which is correct because 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units:49, tens:49, so total eights:98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.
