    "text": " Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I should think differently. Let me consider each digit position separately again, but this time perhaps more carefully. Alternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a systematic way to count. Wait, maybe I should approach it by considering each digit position and how often 4 appears in each. Let's try that again. **Units place:** For each complete set of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4. That's 48 fours. But wait, in the 48th set, which is 480-488, the units digit 4 appears at 484. So, that's one more 4 in the units place beyond the 48 sets, making it 49 fours. So, that's correct. **Tens place:** For the tens place, 4 appears in a block of 10 numbers every 100. So, in each 100 numbers, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). How many hundreds are there in 488? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more numbers (401-488). So, in each of the first four hundreds, there's a block where the tens digit is 4, contributing 10 fours each. That's 4*10=40 fours. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours: 40 +10=50. That matches my earlier count. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488. That's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188. So, 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I think I'll do the same approach, breaking it into units, tens, and hundreds places. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. That's 48 eights. But wait, in the 48th set (480-488), the units digit 8 appears at 488. So, that's one more, making it 49 eights in the units place. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers every 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, each complete block of 100 contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many complete hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more numbers (401-488). In each of the first four hundreds, there's a block where the tens digit is 8, contributing 10 eights each. So, 4*10=40 eights. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. Wait, but the tens digit is 8 for all these, so that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers? Wait, no. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (since 480 has 8 in the tens place, 481, etc., up to 488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place eights: 0. **Total eights:** Units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total 98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counts, especially for the tens place in 8's. When I was counting the tens place for 8's, I considered that in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. But 480 is included in 401-488, right? So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 eights. So, in the first four hundreds, each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40, plus 9 in the last partial hundred, totaling 49. That seems correct. Similarly, for units place, 488/10=48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, and then one more in 488, making it 49. So, units place:49, tens:49, total 98 eights. For fours, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188. So, 188 -98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, because 488 - 400 +1=89. So, that's correct. And for the tens place, in the hundreds, each 100 has 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40, and then 440-449 gives another 10, so 50 total. Units place:49. So, 188 fours. For eights, units:49, tens:49, so 98. Thus, 188-98=90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 within each hundred:\n     - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 within each hundred:\n     - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences for the first four hundreds and 9 for the last partial hundred.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, that seems right. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one. So, 8,18,...,488. That's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set. Each full set (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So that's 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40 and 9, so 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me check each part again. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. That's correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10, and there are 5 hundreds (0-9, 10-19,...400-499). Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only from 440-449. Wait, no, actually, the tens digit being 4 occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. That's correct. Hundreds place: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Okay, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, we'll go through units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 count? Yes, because the book has page 488. So, how many numbers is that? The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many sets we have. Each full hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each with 10, so 40 eights. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So total in tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, in the tens place for eights, I had 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. That's correct. Units place: 49, tens:49, so 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm not sure if I counted correctly. Let me try another approach. Maybe using digit positions and calculating how many times each digit appears in each position. For a 3-digit number, each position (units, tens, hundreds) can be considered separately. The total number of pages is 488, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4, but only up to 488. So, let's calculate for each digit place:\n\n**Units place:**\nFor both 4 and 8, in the units place, how many times do they appear? From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, total number of units digits is 488, so the number of times each digit appears in the units place is floor(488/10)=48 full decades, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48*1=48 fours and 48 eights. But wait, the last partial decade from 481-488: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: fours=48+1=49, eights=48+1=49. That's correct.\n\n**Tens place:**\nSimilarly, for the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each block of 100. So, for the tens digit being 4 or 8, each appears 10 times per hundred. But since we have 488 pages, which is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). So, in the tens place:\n\n- For 4: In each hundred, 10 times (40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, 4 full hundreds: 4*10=40 fours. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours:40+10=50.\n\n- For 8: In each hundred, 10 times (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, 4 full hundreds:4*10=40 eights. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total tens place eights:40+9=49.\n\n**Hundreds place:**\nFor the hundreds digit:\n\n- For 4: Appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, 89 fours.\n\n- For 8: Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 eights.\n\nNow, adding up:\n\nFours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99 +89=188.\n\nEights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe 90 was high, but after checking, it seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Count the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units place:** '4' appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, this happens 49 times (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens place:** '4' appears in blocks of 10 (40-49, 140-149, etc.), totaling 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** '4' appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 times.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Count the number of '8's:**\n   - **Units place:** '8' appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** '8' appears in blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, etc.), totaling 49 times (including 480-488).\n   - **Hundreds place:** No '8's since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's - Number of '8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Hmm, seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the units place. So, from 8 to 488, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-489 would be 10, but we only go up to 488, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers). So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So that's 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for fours. Let me check that again. When counting the tens place for fours, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50. That's correct. Now, for the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. For eights, units place: 8,18,...,488. How many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 =48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot. Let me think again. Maybe I double-counted somewhere? Wait, in the hundreds place for fours, 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. For the tens place in fours, 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is within 488. So, that's five sets, 5*10=50. Units place: 49. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units:49, tens:49, so 98. 188-98=90. Yeah, I think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's count each block: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yep, that looks correct.

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I should verify. Alternatively, I can think of it as for each digit position, how many times 4 appears. Let me think about the hundreds place again. From 1-399, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, that's correct. For the tens place, from 1-488, every 100 numbers have 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 times 100 would be 40, but wait, 400-488 is part of the fifth hundred, so maybe I should calculate it differently. Alternatively, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in each 100 numbers. Since 488 is less than 500, we have four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49 within this hundred, which is 10 numbers (440-449). Wait, no, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's an additional 10. So total tens fours would be 4*10 + 10 = 50. That matches my earlier count. Units place: from 1-488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 /10 = 48.8, which would be 49 occurrences (since 488 includes the 484, which is the 49th 4 in the units place). So, units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. So units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full hundred (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 is the last). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 instead of 10. So total tens eights: 4 full hundreds (each contributing 10) and then 9 in the last partial hundred. So 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but let me check again. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place:49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. Wait, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me just double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. That seems correct. And in the tens place, 50 fours. Units place 49 fours. Total 188. For eights, units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, the difference is indeed 90. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484) \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n   - Total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488) \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I should recount the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and then an extra 4 in 484. So, 48 +1=49. That seems right. So, 49 in units, 50 in tens, 89 in hundreds: total 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, and then 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. So, each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, let me double-check the tens place. Each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one which only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's 4*10 +9=49. So, yes, 49 in tens place. Units place:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me confirm the counts again. Fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188.

Each block of 100 (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 instead of 10.

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I'm overcounting? Let me think again. For units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units? Well, every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus the 484 which is the 49th occurrence. So, yes, 49. Tens place: For each hundred, 10 numbers have 4 in the tens. From 1-488, how many hundreds are there? 4 (since 400 is the start of the fourth hundred). Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, but the tens digit being 4 occurs in every hundred. So, in 1-99, 40-49:10 numbers. 100-199:140-149:10. 200-299:240-249:10. 300-399:340-349:10. 400-488:440-449:10. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that happens. The last occurrence is 488, which is the units digit 8. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, plus the 488, which is the 49th. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's count: 80-89:10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers. So total in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights. Wait, 4 times 10 is 40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me check again. 188 - 98 is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the counts. Let me verify each part again.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each set from 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. Let's count how many complete sets we have. Each 100 numbers has one set of 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and 9 in 480-488. So that's 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4, 14, ..., 484.

Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8, 18, ..., 488.

    "text": " Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is included, so it's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. So, each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 80-89:10, 100-199:180-189:10, 200-299:280-289:10, 300-399:380-389:10, and 400-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, the tens place in the hundreds block 400-488 only has 9 eights, not 10. So, total eights in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 in 480-488. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds digits with 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in the tens place. For the eights in the tens place, I considered 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That seems correct. For the fours in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. Units place for fours: from 4,14,...,484. How many? Let's see, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 49 numbers. Similarly, for eights in units place, 488 is included, so 49 numbers. So, units place for both digits is 49. Tens place for fours: each hundred block contributes 10 fours in the tens place, from 40-49,140-149, etc. Up to 440-449. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 fours. For eights in the tens place, as above, 49. So, 188 fours and 98 eights, difference is 90. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - The last block (480-488) contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be another set, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers. So, each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 eights in the tens place, and the last set (480-488) has 9 eights. So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, zero eights here.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights.\n\nWait, let me verify that again. Units: 49, tens:49, so total 98. That seems correct.\n\nSo, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check if I didn't make a mistake in counting the units place for fours. When I counted units place fours, I thought it was 49, but let me recount. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 fours. Then, the 49th group is 481-490, but since the book ends at 488, only up to 488. So, in the units place, 4 appears once in each group of 10, so 48 times, plus one more at 484? Wait, no, 484 is within the 480-489 group, which is the 48th group (since 480 is the 48th multiple of 10). Wait, no, actually, 1-10 is group 1, 11-20 group 2, ..., 481-490 group 49. But since the book ends at 488, the units digit 4 occurs in 484, which is in group 49. So, that would be 49 occurrences. So, yes, units place for fours is 49.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is 48*10 +8, so 49 occurrences.\n\nWait, but when I counted eights in the tens place, I thought it was 49. Let me see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10 +9=49. That's correct.\n\nSo, fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188.\n\nEights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the hundreds place for fours was 89, because from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. Let me confirm: 488 -400 +1=89. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nEights:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers.

So, 49 is correct. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. Then, in the 49th group (481-490), 488 is included, so that's one more.

So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, but wait, 480 is the first, so from 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers? Wait, 488-480=8, so 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 eights in the tens place for that last set. So total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) which is 40, plus 9, so 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, is that right? Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

For fours in units: from 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers. For fours in tens: 40-49 (10),140-149 (10),240-249 (10),340-349 (10),440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets, each with 10 fours, so 50. For hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights in units: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers. For eights in tens: 80-89 (10),180-189 (10),280-289 (10),380-389 (10),480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49+49=98. Therefore, 188-98=90.

So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. So, number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, when counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) plus 9, so 49. So, yes, 98 eights. So, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10, and there are 5 blocks.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 89.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers between 800-899 exist in the book.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, how many full sets do we have? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For the tens place in 8's, I had 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, 4 full sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49, which is correct. For the fours, in the hundreds place, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers, correct. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. 49+49=98 eights. 188-98=90.

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Let me recount the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The pattern is every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. So, the number of such numbers is floor(488/10) = 48. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. But wait, 48*10=480, so the last number with 4 in the units place is 484, which is 48*10 + 4. So, that's 49 numbers because we start counting from 0: 0-9 has 1 four (4), 10-19 has 14, etc., up to 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, the last four in units place is 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place is 49 fours. So, total fours are 49+50+89=188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is 488/10=48.8, so floor is 48. But wait, starting from 8, the numbers are 8,18,...,488. So, how many terms? It's (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each set from 80-89, 180-189, etc., has 10 numbers, so 5 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 5*10=50. But wait, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, in the tens place, the number of 8's is 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 numbers in 480-488. So, 4*10=40 plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).

The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many terms? The number of terms is floor(488/10) + 1 if 488 is included. 488/10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

How many such numbers are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let's see: starting at 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. So from 8 to 488, how many numbers is that? The first is 8, which is 8, then each step adds 10. So, the nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. We want the last term to be <=488. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 <=488.

Units:49, tens:49, so 98 total. That seems right. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

    "text": " Hmm, seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, the first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. How many such numbers? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is included, so that's 49 eights in the units place. Wait, but wait, 488 is 488, so that's correct. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, let's count each block. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me just verify each step again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. Difference: 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. And for the tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's 50 in total for tens. Units place: 49 fours, correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units place: 49, tens place: 49, correct, because 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 98 eights. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I should verify the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers starting at 4. So, the sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So yes, 49. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4. There are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but in 400-488, the tens digit can still be 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 sets of 10, so 50. That seems correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So total fours:49+50+89=188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is the 49th term because (488 -8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for each hundred, except the last one, there are 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, total 98 eights. Fours:188.

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute each digit place separately. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a formula for counting digits. The formula for counting the number of times a digit d appears in each position up to a number N is a bit involved, but maybe I can apply it here. Alternatively, maybe I should consider each position separately. Let me try again for fours. Units place: For each 10 numbers, there's one 4 in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours. But wait, 488 is the last number, so the units digit 4 in 484 is included. So, 488 has 48 groups, each contributing one 4, but wait, 488 is 48 groups of 10, but 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the units digit 4 occurs 48 times? Wait, no, because in each group of 10, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so in each group, there's exactly one 4. So, 48 complete groups would have 48 fours, but we have 488, which is 48 full groups (up to 480) and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, the number of fours is 48 (from 4,14,...,474) plus any fours in 481-488. But in 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no additional fours. So, units place: 48 fours. Wait, earlier I thought it was 49, but now I'm getting 48. Hmm, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me clarify: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,474,484. Let's count how many numbers that is. The first is 4, which is 1, then 14 is 2, ..., up to 484, which is the 49th number because 484 is 48*10 + 4, so 48 full tens, so 48+1=49. Wait, that seems conflicting with the previous calculation. So, perhaps the correct count is 49 fours in the units place. Let me check with a smaller number to see which approach is correct. For example, from 1 to 20, how many fours in the units place? They are 4 and 14, so 2 fours. 20/10=2, which matches. So, using that logic, 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, but each full ten contributes one 4, so 48 fours. But wait, 488 is 48 full tens (1-480) and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, up to 480, we have 48 fours, and in 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so no additional fours. So, units place: 48 fours. Wait, but earlier I thought 484 is the 49th occurrence. Let me list them: 4,14,24,...,474,484. Let's see how many terms that is. The first term is 4, and each term increases by 10. So, the nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. We want the nth term to be \u2264488. So, 4 + (n-1)*10 \u2264488 \u2192 (n-1)*10 \u2264484 \u2192 n-1 \u226448.4 \u2192 n \u226449.4. So, n=49. So, there are 49 fours in the units place. Hmm, so which is correct? From 1 to 488, how many fours in the units place? It's 49, because 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, maybe the correct count is 49 fours in the units place. So, perhaps my initial approach was correct, and the formula approach was missing something. Let me accept that units place has 49 fours. Then, tens place: numbers where the tens digit is 4. These are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 such numbers. From 1-488, how many such blocks? 400-449 is within 488, but 450-488 doesn't have a full block. Wait, let's count: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Now, hundreds place: numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. These are from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, plus 89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many terms. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. We want 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264488. So, (n-1)*10 \u2264480 \u2192 n-1 \u226448 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens digit occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many full blocks we have. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last number). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers: 480-488. So, the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Hmm, maybe that's correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, starting from 8, each step of 10. The number of terms can be calculated as (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last block, which only goes up to 488. Let's count them: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, let me check again. For the fours, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188. For the eights, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, total 98. 188-98=90. That seems correct. But wait, let me double-check the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488-400=88, so 88+1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Units:49, tens:50, so 49+50=99, plus 89=188. That's correct.

Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit '4' appears in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each block contributing 10 occurrences. There are 50 such numbers.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit '4' appears in numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit '8' appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The last block (480-488) has 9 numbers. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 times more than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. So, units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 exist? Yes, but since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 is part of that. So, how many sets? Each hundred has a 80-89 block. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488-480+1=9). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me count again. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. 188-98=90. That seems correct.

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I should verify. Alternatively, another way to calculate the number of fours in each position: For units place, in every 10 numbers, there's one 4. So, for 488 pages, the number of times 4 appears in units place is floor(488/10) + 1 if the last digit is 4 or more. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, and since the last number is 488, which ends with 8, so the last 4 in units place is 484, which is 48*10 +4, so 48 times, but wait, 484 is the 49th occurrence because it starts from 4 (1st), 14 (2nd), ..., 484 (49th). So, units place: 49 fours. Tens place: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 1-400, that's 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 in 400-488, which is 10 numbers (400-409, but wait, 400-409 is 10 numbers, but 400 is included in the hundreds place. Wait, actually, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, which is 10 numbers, and also in 440-449, which is another 10, but wait, no, 400-409 is the first set, then 410-419, etc., so in the hundreds place 4, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times. So, total tens place fours: from 1-399, we have 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 fours in tens place, so 4*10=40. Then from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens place fours: 40 +10=50. That matches my earlier count. So, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I think I should do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many terms? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-399, that's 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, total tens place eights:40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place eights:0. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90.

Now, moving on to counting the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 =48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which might be less. Let me check: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 488 is included, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So total 49 eights in tens place. Wait, 4*10=40, plus 9 is 49? Wait, 40+9=49? No, 40+9=49? Wait, 4*10=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in tens place. Wait, but wait, 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So that's 4 times 10 plus 9, which is 49. So, 49 eights in tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer would be 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for eights. I thought that in the tens place, 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So that's 4*10=40 plus 9=49. But wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place for that block. So, yes, 49 eights in tens place. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Fours are 188. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can use a formula or a different approach to confirm. Alternatively, I can think about each digit position separately and calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear. Let me try that for units place again. For units place, in numbers from 1 to N, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place is floor((N +1)/10). So, for 4 in units place up to 488: floor((488 +1)/10)=floor(489/10)=48.9, which is 48. But earlier I thought it was 49. Hmm, there's a discrepancy here. Wait, perhaps the formula is slightly different. Let me check. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra in the incomplete decade. So, for N=488, the number of complete decades is 48 (since 488 /10=48.8). But wait, 488 is in the 48th decade (480-489). Wait, no, 488 is in the 48th decade as 48*10=480. So, the number of complete decades is 48, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 fours. But then, in the incomplete decade (480-488), the units digit 4 appears once (at 484). So, total units place fours: 48 +1=49. So, that aligns with my initial count. So, the formula would be floor(N/10)*1 + (1 if the units digit >=4 else 0). Wait, maybe it's better to think as (N // 10) + 1 if the last digit is >=4. But in this case, 488//10=48, and since 488%10=8 >=4, we add 1, making it 49. So, 49 fours in units place. Similarly, for eights in units place, same approach: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488%10=8 >=8, we add 1, so 48+1=49 eights in units place. So that's correct. Now, for the tens place, the formula is a bit more involved. The number of times a digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to N is calculated as follows: Let's consider the higher digits and the lower digits. For a number N, say N=abc (a three-digit number), the count for digit d in the tens place is:\n\n- higher = N divided by 100 (integer division)\n- current = (N /10) %10\n- lower = N %10\n\nIf current > d: count += (higher +1) *10\nIf current ==d: count += higher *10 + lower +1\nIf current <d: count += higher *10\n\nBut let's apply this to our case, where d=4 and d=8, and N=488.\n\nFirst, for fours in tens place:\n\nN=488\n\nhigher = 488 // 100 =4\ncurrent = (488 //10) %10 =48%10=8\nlower =488%10=8\n\nSince current=8 >4, we use the first case:\n\ncount = (higher +1)*10 = (4+1)*10=5*10=50\n\nSo, 50 fours in tens place. That matches my earlier count.\n\nNow, for eights in tens place, d=8:\n\nhigher=4\ncurrent=8\nlower=8\n\nSince current=8 ==d=8, we use the second case:\n\ncount = higher*10 + lower +1=4*10 +8 +1=40+8+1=49\n\nWhich also matches my earlier count of 49 eights in tens place.\n\nNow, for hundreds place, fours:\n\nN=488\n\nhigher=488//1000=0\ncurrent=(488//100)%10=4%10=4\nlower=488%100=88\n\nSince current=4 ==d=4, we use the second case:\n\ncount= higher*100 + lower +1=0*100 +88 +1=89\n\nWhich is correct, as we have 89 fours in hundreds place.\n\nFor eights in hundreds place, d=8:\n\nhigher=0\ncurrent=4\nlower=88\n\nSince current=4 <8, we use the third case:\n\ncount= higher*100=0*100=0\n\nWhich is correct, as there are no eights in hundreds place.\n\nSo, summing up:\n\nFours:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99+89=188\n\nEights:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nSo, there are 90 more fours than eights in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Number of blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Number of complete blocks: 4 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).\n   - Incomplete block: 480-488 (9 numbers).\n   - Total: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n- More 4's than 8's: \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Let me recount the units place. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That would be 48 fours. But wait, the 49th occurrence would be in the 49th set, which is 481-490, but 488 is the last page, so 481-488. So, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, 484 is within this range, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, 49 fours in the units place. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing an 8 in the units place. The last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the book, so how many numbers is that? Each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place, except maybe the last block. From 1-400: 4 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 eights in the tens place. So that's 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 more. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for eights. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. Similarly, for fours in the tens place, it's 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449, which is 5 blocks of 10, so 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. Units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total fours:188. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. Difference:188-98=90.

Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, and the last set (480-488) has 9 numbers. So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

Let's see: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers). Wait, 480-489 would be 10, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488. That's 4*10 +9=49.

    "text": " Hmm, that seems right. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? Let's see: The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many sets? From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. Wait, but let me make sure: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, +89=188. Correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right. And for the tens place, 440-449: 10 numbers, so that's correct. For eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, I think the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488 (9 numbers). Total: 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - **Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8's appear every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see, the last number is 488, which ends with an 8. So, how many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full steps, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many full sets of 100 have 10 eights in the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, 49 + 49 is 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I made a mistake with the units place. Wait, when I considered the units place, I thought 484 is the last occurrence, which would be the 49th. Let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. So, from 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last term - first term)/common difference) +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 =48 +1=49. Yes, that's correct. So units place has 49 fours. Tens place: 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 89. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Okay, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, let's see how many full sets of 100 we have. Each set (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 488 -480 +1=9. So, that's 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488:9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 in 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me check if I did everything correctly. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yes, that seems correct.

But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's see: each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8.
