    "text": " 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check up to 488. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 9 numbers (480-488). So, 4 sets of 10, which is 40, plus 9 more, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me verify: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488 (9 numbers). Total = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is included. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488. Wait, let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many terms? It's from 8 to 488 with a common difference of 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. Wait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers? Wait, 480 is the first, then 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers. So, the tens place 8's are: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, each hundred block has 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which has 9 because the book ends at 488. So, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-500, but the book only goes up to 488, so from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total eights in tens place: 40 +9=49. That matches. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, except the last block (480-488) which contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each hundred block contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which contributes 9. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49.

So, 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many numbers? 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each block gives 10, and there are 5 blocks, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1=49. Tens place: 80-89,180-189, etc., up to 480-488. Each hundred block gives 10, but the last one gives 9, so 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, total 49. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, I can divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's 8, 18, ..., 488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Each full set (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so that's 4 sets: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and then 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, let's calculate: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total eights in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Wait, that doesn't seem right.

So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. So total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49. 49+49=98.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Wait, no, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in adding. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 99 + 89 is 188? Let me add it again: 99 + 89. 90 + 80 is 170, and 9 + 9 is 18, so total 170 + 18 = 188. Okay, so total 4's are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. How many such numbers? Let's see, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The formula is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1. So, (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets of tens digits being 8.

Let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct because 488-400+1=89. And for the tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers, and 40-49, 140-149, etc., each 10, so 5 sets, 5*10=50. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? 484 is the 49th occurrence because (484-4)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, units place 49. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's, units place: 8,18,...,488. How many? (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9.

    "text": " From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in terms of the hundreds digit, each of these numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 fours. Now, let me add them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number is 488, so how many? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but including 488, that's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, 8 is the first, 18 is the second, ..., 488 is the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. Wait, that can't be right because 188-98=90. But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for fours. When I counted the tens place for fours, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's five sets of 10, so 50 fours. That seems correct. For the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. For the eights, in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, 4 full sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial set from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 49 eights. So, total eights:98. Fours:188. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct. I think the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   There are 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   Each set has 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   There are 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.  \n   The first four sets have 10 each, and the last set (480-488) has 9.  \n   Total: 4*10 + 9 = **49**\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   No page numbers in 800-899, so 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

The hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, that's correct. Units place for 4's: from 4,14,...,484: that's 49 numbers. Tens place for 4's: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449: 5 blocks of 10, so 50. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. For 8's, units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds:0, total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but earlier I thought the answer was 90, but I'm not sure if I counted correctly. Let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, total eights are 49+49=98. So, fours are 188, eights 98, difference is 90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place for 4's. Let me check again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first occurrence is at 4, then every 10 numbers. So, the last occurrence is at 484. Now, how many numbers is that? Let's see: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, that's correct, 49 fours in units place. Similarly, for 8's in units place: from 8 to 488, same way: ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, that's correct. Now, tens place for 4's: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. So, 50 fours in tens place. For 8's in tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49. So, that's correct. Hundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Hundreds place for 8's: none, since the book ends at 488. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Total eights: 49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This is 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This is 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This is 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive). So, for the first four sets, each has 10 numbers, and the last set has 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems off because 188 - 98 is 90. But let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for fours. Let me check again. When counting the tens place for fours, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49 is the first block, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). So, 5 blocks * 10 = 50. That seems correct. Similarly, for eights in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four are 10 each, and the last is 9, so 4*10 +9=49. That seems right. Units place for both digits: 49 each. So, fours total 188, eights total 98. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I'm thinking, does 488 count as an 8 in the units place? Yes, because 488 ends with an 8. So, that's included in the 49 units place eights. Similarly, 448 would have a 4 in the hundreds, tens, and units places. But I think I've accounted for all of them correctly. So, I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** None (since the book ends at 488) \u2192 0 times.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets of 10, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be next, but since the book ends at 488, that's only up to 488. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, we have 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 eights. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. But then from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total eights in tens place would be 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, that makes more sense. Because from 1-400, it's 4 sets, each with 10, so 40, then from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers, so 40+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but earlier I thought units place had 49 eights, tens had 49, so total 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to miscount. Let me recount the fours first. Units place: from 4, 14, ..., 484. So, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks of 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. Now for the eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: Each hundred block contributes 10, so 4 blocks (1-400) give 40, and then 480-488 gives 9, so 40+9=49. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, each contributing one 4. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, does 488 count? Yes, because 488 is the last page. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last block. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484) \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 5 sets of 10 \u2192 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488) \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 4 sets of 10 and 9 numbers \u2192 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488 \u2192 0 times.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488).

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But let's check if 488 is included. The last 8 in the units place is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one more. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many numbers have 8 in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place.

Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480 is the first, then 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So that's 9 numbers. So, the tens place has 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Hmm, so the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the tens place for eights. When I considered the tens place for eights, I had 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. For fours, the hundreds place was 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Units place: 4,14,...,484: which is 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149, etc., each 10, so 5 sets: 5*10=50.

So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each block from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9 =49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's.

For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yes, that seems correct.

There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449). Each block has 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400 to 488, there are 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4.\n   - **Total Fours:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488). The first four blocks have 10 each, and the last block (480-488) has 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total Eights:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 exist? Yes, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, let's count how many sets of 100 have the tens digit as 8. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, let me check: 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, the tens digit 8 occurs in 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the difference is number of 4's minus number of 8's: 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block is 10 numbers. Let's see how many such blocks are there up to 488. The last block is 380-389 because 480-489 would be beyond 488, but 480-488 is part of the 400s. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, not a full block. So, how many full blocks are there? From 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. But wait, let me check if 480-488 is included. Since 480-488 is part of the hundreds place, but the tens digit is 8 only from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, in the tens place, how many eights are there in 480-488? The tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights would be 4 blocks *10 +9=49? Wait, no. Wait, the 480-488 is part of the hundreds place, but the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 more eights. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 (from 80-89, etc.) plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Wait, but wait: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49+49=98. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Now, the number of fours was 188, and the number of eights was 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the fours or the eights. Let me recount the fours: Units place: from 4,14,...,484. That's (484-4)/10 +1=48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488: that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, 49+50+89=188 fours. Now, eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. How many? 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, units and tens:49+49=98. So, fours:188, eights:98. Difference:188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The pattern is every 10 numbers, starting at 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, the number of such numbers is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct. Tens place: For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. How many hundreds are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, not a full hundred. So, in 0-99, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49). Similarly, in 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. Same for 200-299: 240-249, 10. 300-399: 340-349, 10. Now, 400-488: the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many sets? Each hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, from 480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, so 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block of 100 contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Final Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that is. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would give 48 full sets, but including 488, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers add an 8 in the units place.

So, total eights in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 +10 +9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488.

Let me count how many sets of 10 there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9 (since 488 - 480 +1 =9). So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, that seems off because when I counted the fours, I got 188, and eights are 98, so the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in the tens place for eights. Let me recount the tens place for eights. Each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) has a set of numbers where the tens digit is 8. So:\n\n- 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10\n- 200-299: 280-289 \u219210\n- 300-399:380-389\u219210\n- 400-488:480-488\u21929\n\nSo, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. Now, for fours, I had 188. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place again for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Units place: 49 fours, tens place:50 fours, so 89+50+49=188. That seems correct. So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me check again because sometimes I might have miscounted. For units place, fours: 4,14,...,484. How many? 484 is the 49th number because 484 \u00f710=48.4, so 49 numbers. Similarly, eights: 8,18,...,488. 488 \u00f710=48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place: 49 fours, 49 eights. Tens place: fours: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each set is 10 numbers, and there are 5 sets (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449). So 5\u00d710=50 fours. Eights: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49. So, tens place:50 fours,49 eights. Hundreds place: fours:400-488\u219289 fours, eights:0. So, total fours:49+50+89=188, eights:49+49+0=98. Difference:188-98=90.

Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488.

So that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800 or above, but since the book has only 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8.

So, total fours are 188, and total eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that can't be right because when I calculated fours, I got 188, and eights as 98, so 188 - 98 is indeed 90. But let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, yes, the difference is 90. Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Because 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, but when counting the hundreds place, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. Wait, but let me think again about the units place for fours. From 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? The formula is (last - first)/step +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So that's correct. Similarly, for tens place, each hundred has 10 fours, and there are 5 hundreds (0-9, 100-199, etc.), but wait, 400-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but since we only go up to 488, does that affect the count? No, because in the tens place, we're considering 40-49,140-149, etc., which are all within 488. So, 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Correct. For eights: units place, 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So total 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights. Difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. That's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.

So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488). The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. How many such numbers? Let's see: starting at 8, each step of 10. The number of terms can be calculated by (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, how many sets? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, yes, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. How many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds digits with 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the Number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total numbers: 49 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the Number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total numbers: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four sets contribute 10 each, totaling 40.
