    "text": " From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is included, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, each block from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

Now, adding up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll check each place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many that is. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one, so 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many full sets we have. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 +10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me double-check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10*4=40 plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights from each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, actually, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right. For the tens place of 4's, 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's five sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Units place: from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers, which is 49 numbers. So, 49 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place:49, tens place:49 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, but 480-489 would be 10, but since it's only up to 488, it's 9, so 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9: 4*10 +9=49). So, 49+49=98.

Let me check: 400 is the first, 401, 402,...,488. So yes, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does it count? Yes, because 488 is page 488, so the units digit is 8. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets we have. Each set is 10 numbers, so 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, total eights in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's calculate how many numbers that is. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block which goes up to 488. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.

Let's see how many that is. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 488 count? Yes, because 488 is included. So, starting from 8, 18, ..., 488. How many terms? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, let's count each block. - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289:10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488:9 numbers. So, total eights in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 +9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. So from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's the integer division of 488 by 10, which is 48, but since 488 itself doesn't end with 4, it's actually 48 times. Wait, earlier I thought it was 49, but that might be a mistake. Let me recalculate. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48 times, because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. So units place has 48 fours. Then, tens place: each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, so from 1-488, how many hundreds are there? 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488). Wait, no, 488 is less than 500, so it's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times, so 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40, but wait, 401-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place: numbers from 400-488. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, total fours: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 187. Hmm, that's 187 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Numbers ending with 8: 8,18,28,...,488. How many are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but since 488 ends with 8, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, each hundred contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which contributes 9. So, how many hundreds? From 1-488, we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. In each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 8 occurs in 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So that's 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 40 +9=49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 fours -98 eights = 89. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check the counts. For fours: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

    "text": " From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds place has 89 fours. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book ends at 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, so 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Wait, does 480-489 count? But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 would have the tens digit as 8, but only up to 488. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, we have four sets: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, total eights in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. The hundreds digit goes up to 4, so for each hundred, the tens digit can be 8. So, for 0-99: 80-89:10 eights. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9. So, total: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49 + 49 = 98. But earlier, for fours, I had 188. So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yes, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see: each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Wait, but 380-389 is within 488, so that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights. So, 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 89 eights. Now, the difference is number of 4's minus number of 8's: 188 - 89 = 99. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For the fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89, total=188. For the eights: units=49, tens=40, hundreds=0, total=89. So, 188-89=99. Hmm, maybe that's correct. But let me check if I didn't overcount somewhere. Let me recount the units place for 4's: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484-4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place for 4's: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place for 4's: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct. For eights: units=49, tens=40, correct. So, 188-89=99.

So, let's count each set. From 80-89: 10 numbers. From 180-189: 10. From 280-289:10. From 380-389:10. From 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers).

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for fours. Let me check again. For tens place fours: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Correct. For eights in tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.

The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1 = (484)/10 = 48.4, so 48 full tens, but since 484 is included, it's 49. So, units:49. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each set is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50. Hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. That's correct. Now, eights: units place:8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each set except the last has 10 numbers, and the last has 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let me see how many there are. The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488/10=48.8, so integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last block, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's calculate: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because 188 seems high for 4's. Let me recount the 4's: Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) +1. So, (488-4)=484, 484/10=48.4, floor is 48, so 48+1=49. So, units:49. Tens place: in each hundred, 10 numbers. From 40-49, 140-149, etc. Up to 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: Units:49, tens:49, so total 98. So, difference is 188-98=90.

    "text": " Let me think: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, each full block (e.g., 80-89) has 10 numbers, but the last block (480-488) only has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9. So total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't miss anything. For 4's: Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. That's correct. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, 5 sets, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. Total 4's: 49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. Same as above, 49. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10, the last has 9. So 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place: 0.

Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many? From 0 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, which would give 48 fours, but since 488 is included, we have an extra 4 in 484, making it 49. So that's correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, and there are 4 hundreds (1,2,3,4). But wait, from 1-400, each hundred has 10, so 4 hundreds would be 40. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. That seems correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.

So, in the tens place, we have 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights. Wait, let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it.

So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me check the tens place for eights again. Wait, when I considered the tens place for eights, I included 480-488 as 9 numbers, but actually, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 480 is included. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, correct. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488), totaling 49. So, that's correct. Similarly, for fours in the tens place, we had 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So, 400 is included, 488 is included, so that's correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours are 188, eights are 98, so the difference is 90.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be the next set, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks are there. From 1-400: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. This totals 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Wait, but 488 is included, right? So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Hmm, let me check that again because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many that is. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but including 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me double-check. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Wait, but earlier I thought units place had 49 and tens had 49, so total 98. Wait, but earlier when I was counting fours, I had 188 fours, and eights have 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But wait, let me check again because I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. Let me recount the tens place for 8's. So, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four sets (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last set, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, total is 40 + 9 = 49. So, that's correct. So, 49 in tens place, 49 in units place, total 98 eights. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

The book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except maybe the last one.

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. That's correct. Tens place: Each hundred block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. But wait, from 400-488, the tens place can also have 4 in 440-449, which is another 10. So total tens place fours would be 40 +10=50. That's correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours:49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The last number is 488, which is 8*61=488, so 61 occurrences. Wait, let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So units place has 49 eights. Wait, no: 8,18,...,488. Let me calculate it as (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except maybe the last one. Let's see: From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, in 401-488, the tens place is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So total tens place eights:40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me double-check because earlier I thought 4's were 188 and 8's were 98, so 188-98=90. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, when I counted the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, but actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So 9 eights in the tens place for that set. So 4*10=40 from the first four blocks, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for fours in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours.

In the hundreds place, when counting fours, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, but does 488 count as a four in the hundreds place? Yes, because 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for fours, 440-449 is 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place, so that's correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct.

Let's go through each digit position again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're including both 8 and 488, we take the integer part and add 1. Wait, actually, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? The formula is floor((488 - 8)/10) + 1. That would be floor(480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, each block before 400 contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9. Let's calculate: From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds places with 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Okay, that's correct. So total eights are 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but earlier I thought units and tens each contribute 49, so 98 total. Now, the fours were 188, and eights are 98, so the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours. Let me recount the fours: Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So 49+50+89=188. Correct. For eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So total eights are 49+49=98. So difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So that's correct. So the total fours are indeed 188, and eights are 98, so 90 more fours. Wait, but let me check the tens place for eights again. 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9. So that's correct. So yes, 49 in units, 49 in tens, so 98 eights. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me count: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets of 10, so 48 eights. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would be another set, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (each contributing 10 eights) and one set of 9. So, 4*10 = 40, plus 9 is 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

    "text": " From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4's appear 188 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, since the book ends at 488, the next set would be 480-489, but 488 is the last page. So, how many sets do we have? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last one). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me double-check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recheck the counts. For 4's: units (49), tens (50), hundreds (89). Wait, earlier I thought 440-449 is 10 numbers, but from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 numbers. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So that's correct. So 4's: 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units (49), tens (49). Wait, but in the tens place, I had 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. So 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me make sure I didn't overcount in the tens place for 4's. The tens digit being 4 occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets of 10, which is 50. That's correct. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, it's 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488, which is 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. So, that's correct. So, I think my calculations are accurate. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, starting from 8, the last number is 488. To find how many, I can divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488.

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 1-488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but the last partial ten (481-488) includes 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units: 49. Tens place: each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens. How many hundreds are there? From 0-400, so 4 sets: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.

That's correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is 488/10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. Wait, let me check: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49 + 49 = 98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check the counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188.

    "text": " Let's see, from 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, it's from 400-488. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Each full block (e.g., 80-89) has 10 eights in the tens place. How many full blocks are there? From 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, the last block is 480-488, which has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so 9 eights in the tens place. So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place.

Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the units place. From 8, 18, ..., 488. The first is 8, and the last is 488. The number of terms can be calculated by (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.

Because 488 - 400 = 88, so adding 1 gives 89. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 exist? Yes, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many such blocks we have. From 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). 101-200: 180-189 (10). 201-300: 280-289 (10). 301-400: 380-389 (10). 401-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 49. Wait, that's 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, in the tens place for 4's, I had 50 fours. Let me recount that. For the tens place, 4 can appear in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. That's correct.\n\nFor the units place, 4's: from 4,14,...,484. 484 is the 49th number because 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10 => n = (484 -4)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 fours in units place.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the eights: units place, 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th occurrence because (488 -8)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in units place.\n\nTens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place.\n\nHundreds place: none, so 0.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 +0=98.\n\nThus, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90 more fours. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 49 numbers). Wait, but does 488 count as the 49th? Let me list: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Wait, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 9 numbers (480-488). So, let me count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check again. Units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So total eights: 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me recount the tens place. Each hundred block (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. So, units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0. So, total eights: 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This totals 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds place has 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would be next, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let me check how many sets there are. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 40 eights. But wait, 480-488: the tens digit is 8 here as well, right? Because 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights would be 4 sets of 10 plus 9, which is 49. Wait, but is that correct? Let me think. Wait, no, because 480-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but since the book only goes up to 488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens place eights are: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.
