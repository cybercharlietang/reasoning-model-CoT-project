    "text": " Let me see: the first 8 is at 8, and the last one in the units place is 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? From 8 to 488, that's every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which would give 48 eights. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8 in the tens place. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: from 480 to 489 is 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9 numbers. So, how does that affect the count? So, in the hundreds place, 480-488 is 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, the total number of eights in the tens place is 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me check that again. Units:49, tens:49, so 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. Let me recount the eights, especially in the tens place. For the tens place, each 100 has 10 eights, so from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4*10 +9=49, which matches what I had before. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, totaling 98 eights. For fours, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, totaling 188. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n   Total '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each block contributes 10 occurrences except the last, which contributes 9. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n   Total '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** Subtract the number of '8's from '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's than '8's printed in the book.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me see, the first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but including 488, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, let's count how many sets of 100 have 8 in the tens place. Each block (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, no: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, is that correct? 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9. So, the first four sets (80-89, etc.) have 10 each, so 4*10=40, and the last set has 9. So total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let's see: starting at 8, each 10 numbers adds one more. So, 8 is the 1st, 18 the 2nd, ..., 488 would be the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full steps, but the last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. But wait, does 380-389 fall within 488? Yes, because 389 is less than 488. However, the next set would be 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that set. Let me count how many full sets there are. Each hundred has one set of 10 where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, the next set would be 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, we have 40 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, but does the tens digit being 8 in 480-488 count as 9 eights? Because each number from 480 to 488 has an 8 in the tens place, right? So, that's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

    "text": " Wait, 488 is included, so let's see. The first 8 is at 8, then every 10 after that. The last occurrence would be 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 8,18,28,...,488. Let me calculate how many terms are in this sequence. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488. Solving for n: 10(n-1) = 480 => n-1 = 48 => n=49. So, there are 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389.

So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so only 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, which is 49. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, so that's correct.

Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 plus 9 is 49.

Units:49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. Yep, that seems right. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, did I do that right? Let me check again. 4's:188, 8's:98. 188-98=90. Yes, that's correct. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in counting the units place for 4's. Let me check again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The sequence starts at 4 and ends at 484, with a common difference of 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place:49 fours. That's correct. For the tens place:40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 blocks of 10, so 5*10=50. So, tens place:50 fours. Hundreds place:400-488:89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct. For the 8's: units place:8,18,28,...,488. That's 49 numbers, as 488 is the 49th term. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, and the last block has 9. So, 10*4 +9=49. Hundreds place:0. So, total eights:49+49=98. Thus, 188-98=90.

So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8*49=488? Wait, no, 8*49 is 392, which is 392, but 488 is 488. Wait, maybe I should think differently. The units digit cycles every 10, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's the number of complete decades (each of 10 numbers) plus any extra. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, 48*10=480, so up to 480, there are 48 eights in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place, making it 49 eights in total. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, that can't be right because I thought earlier that in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, right? So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Hmm, but let me double-check. Wait, in the units place, I had 49 eights because 488 is included. In the tens place, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 in the tens place. So, total eights:49+49=98. Wait, but I'm wondering if the 480-488 is correctly counted. Let me list them: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, so yes, 9 eights in the tens place from 480-488. So, total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me check again. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. But wait, I'm a bit unsure because I thought maybe the hundreds place for fours might be higher, but I think I counted correctly. Let me think again about the hundreds place for fours: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.

Let's check: 8,18,28,...,488. That's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full set (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more fours than eights, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights. Wait, let me double-check the counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in the tens place for eights. For the tens place, I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. For fours, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, which is correct. Units place for fours: 4,14,...,484. 484 is 480 +4, so 484 is the 49th number, so 49 fours. Tens place for fours: 40-49 (10),140-149 (10),240-249 (10),340-349 (10),440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each 10, so 50 fours. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For eights, units:49, tens:49, so 98. 188-98=90.

Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for eights, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers. Is that correct? Let's see: from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 488-480+1=9 numbers. So, yes, 9 eights in the tens place for the 480-488 range. So, 10 for each of the other ranges and 9 for the last, totaling 49. So, that seems correct. Similarly, for fours in the tens place, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50, because 440-449 is within 488. So, that's correct. And in the hundreds place, fours go from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours there. So, I think my counts are correct, and the difference is 90. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly for fours? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89. Yes, that's correct. So, I think the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (from 0 to 484, every 10 numbers).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89 (488 - 400 + 1).\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = **49**.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the last set. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place, except maybe the last block. Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, right? Wait no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers (480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for the last block. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Wait, that seems off because earlier I thought the tens place was 49, units 49, so total 98 eights. Wait, but let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours and eights. For fours: units place: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, (484-4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. For eights: units place:8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm getting 90, but I think I might have made a mistake because I recall sometimes when counting, especially in the hundreds place, there might be overlaps or miscalculations. Let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right. For eights in the hundreds place, since the book ends at 488, there are no eights there. So, total eights:98. So, the difference is 188-98=90.

The nth term is given by an = a1 + (n-1)d. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 8: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n=49.

So, total fours:188, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more fours are printed than eights. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers. But wait, let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems. Let me go through each digit position again for both fours and eights. **Fours:**\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484.

Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in tens place.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers because 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.

So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which would give 48 eights. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets are there? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, not 10). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that right? Let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but let me check: from 8,18,...,488. How many? Let's calculate how many numbers between 1 and 488 have 8 in the units place. The last such number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 = 8 + 10*(48-1) = 8 + 470 = 478, but wait, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so actually, the count is 49. Because starting at 8 (which is the first), then 18 (second), ..., 488 (49th). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480,481,...,488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens place counts are: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Let me count how many full sets there are and then the partial set. Each full set (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many full sets are there? Well, up to 488, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and then 480-488. So, that's 5 sets, but the last one is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9. So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. The last set, 480-488, has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, that's 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, did I count correctly for the tens place in eights? Let me check again. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers). So, that's 4*10=40 plus 9=49. That seems right. So, the difference is indeed 90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for fours was 89, but let me check that again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, 188 fours total, 98 eights total. 188-98=90.

    "text": " Let me think. The first 8 is at 8, and the last one is at 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? From 8 to 488, every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would suggest 49 numbers, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8. So, how many sets are there? From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480-488 is 9 numbers). So, let's calculate: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, that's 49. Wait, but let me check 480-488: 480,481,...,488, that's 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1=9. So, yes, 9. So, total tens place eights: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place. When I considered 480-488, I thought there are 9 numbers, but actually, from 480 to 488, inclusive, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, yes, 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, that part is correct. So, tens place eights:49, which is correct. Units place eights:49, correct. So, total eights:98. Fours:188. So, difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Total occurrences: 49\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.  \n   - Total occurrences: 50\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.  \n   - Total numbers: 89  \n   - Total occurrences: 89\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Total occurrences: 49\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.  \n   - Total occurrences: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 0\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

To find how many terms, I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence. The nth term is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where d=10. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 8: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me think again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9.

So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for eights.

So, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. So, that's correct. So, 4 full sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one set of 9, totaling 49. So, 49 in tens place. Units place:49, tens:49, so 98 eights. Fours:188. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check if I counted correctly for the hundreds place in fours. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, as 488-400+1=89. Yes, that's correct. So, I think my calculations are right.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8. Let me count how many sets of 10 numbers have 8 in the tens place. From 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the hundreds place for fours: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. For the tens place of fours, it's 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of those is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Correct. Units place for fours: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, ending at 484, which is 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct. For eights: units place is 49, tens place is 49. Wait, in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four sets is 10 numbers, and the last set is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights. I think that's correct. But wait, let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. Correct. So, 89 fours in hundreds place. Okay, I think I'm confident that the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{484}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.  \n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.  \n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.  \n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 0 \\).\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**  \n\\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

The first is 8, and the last is 488. The difference between 8 and 488 is 480, and since each step is 10, the number of terms is 480/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that seems correct. So, total eights: 49 + 49 = 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights, I subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers. Wait, but let me check again because I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for eights. Specifically, in the tens place, when I considered 480-488, I said that's 9 numbers, right? So, 480, 481, ..., 488: that's 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) is 40, plus 9, which is 49. That seems correct. So, 49 in tens place, 49 in units place, total 98 eights. Fours: 49 units, 50 tens, 89 hundreds, total 188. 188 - 98 = 90.

There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, giving 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences (including 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
