    "text": " The last occurrence is 488. So, how many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full steps, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, 8,18,28,...,488. Let me count: the first is 8 (1), then 18 (2), ..., 488 would be the 49th term because (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, seems correct. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488 inclusive. That's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct. For the tens place, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. For eights in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 49 total. Units place: 49, correct. So, yes, 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let me count each block. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, the next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, we have 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10*4 +9 = 49.

So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is included, but since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? Each set is 10 numbers, except maybe the last one. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 full sets (4*10=40) plus 9, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right.

Wait, but 488 is the 49th number after 0. Let me confirm: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's see how many full sets there are. Each full set (like 80-89) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. How many full sets are there? From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. That's 4*10 +9=49.

So that's 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Yep, that's correct. And for fours, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, totaling 188. So, 188-98=90.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let me check each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289:10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus the 9 in 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

Wait, but 488 is included, so that's correct. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so that's 9 instead of 10.

Yes. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

Let's calculate: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many full sets of 10 we have. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, that's correct. For the tens place in fours, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. That's correct because 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of those is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Units place for fours: from 4,14,...,484. How many? Let's see, 484 is the 49th number because 484/10=48.4, so 48 full tens and then the 49th is 484. So, 49 fours in units place. That adds up. For eights: units place is 49, which is from 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th number because 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 5 sets, but the last set only goes up to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10=40 and 9, totaling 49. So, units and tens each have 49 eights, totaling 98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90.

So, for the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) each contributing 10 eights, and then 480-488 contributing 9 eights. So, that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place.

For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. I think that's correct.

So, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me make sure about the units place for 8's. The last page is 488, so the units digit 8 occurs at 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place for 8's is 49.\n\nWait, but let me think: from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? The first is 8, then 18, 28,...,488. So, how many terms? It's an arithmetic sequence where a1=8, d=10, an=488. The nth term is a1 + (n-1)*d. So, 488=8 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 8:480=(n-1)*10. So, n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 terms. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for fours in the units place: from 4,14,...,484. So, 484=4 + (n-1)*10. 484-4=480=(n-1)*10. So, n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 fours in the units place. Correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place for fours was 49, which is correct. So, adding up, that's correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 fours minus 98 eights, which equals 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\nSo, there are **90** more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

Yes, 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such blocks we have.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups of 10, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count each block: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me make sure. Units:49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. Yep. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Let me just go through this again quickly to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188.

So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, units place is 49, tens is 49, so 49+49=98. Hmm, but let me check the tens place again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, yes, 49 in tens place. Units place is 49, so total eights are 49+49=98. Wait, but when I count units place, from 8 to 488, that's 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Similarly, in the tens place, it's 49. So total eights are 49+49=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
