So, the number of 8's in the units place is the number of times 8 appears in the units digit. Let's see: the first is 8, then 18, 28,..., up to 488. How many terms? The last term is 488, which is 8 + (n-1)*10 =488. Solving for n: (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place, except maybe the last block. Let's see: From 1-100: 80-89:10 eights. 101-200:180-189:10. 201-300:280-289:10. 301-400:380-389:10. Now, 401-488:480-488. How many eights in the tens place here? From 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, let me check: 1-100:10, 101-200:10, 201-300:10, 301-400:10, and 401-488:9. So, 10*4=40 plus 9 is 49.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, but let me make sure. Units:49, tens:49, so 98. Hmm, but wait, in the tens place, when I counted 480-488, that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 -98=90.

    "text": " The last occurrence is 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers (since 8*50=480, but 488 is the 49th number). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many numbers in each set. 80-89:10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, because 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Checking fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for 4's. Let me check again. For the tens place of 4's, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, which is 50 fours. That seems correct. For the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place: from 4,14,...,484, which is 49 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For eights, units place: 8,18,...,488, which is 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10*4=40 +9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. So, 49+49=98 eights. Therefore, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

Now, since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so does that count as a full set? No, it's only 9 numbers because 489 is beyond 488. So, how many full sets do we have? From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9.

So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98.

Wait, but 488 is 488, so the units digit is 8, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many eights in the tens place? Each set from 80-89, etc., up to 480-488. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). So, that's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Wait, so 49 +49 is 98? Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. So, now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. To find how many more fours there are than eights, subtract 98 from 188: 188 -98=90. Wait, that can't be right because 188-98 is 90. Hmm, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through each digit place again for both fours and eights. **For fours:**\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? The last number is 484, which is 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct.\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each set is 10 numbers, and there are 5 sets (40-49 is the first, then 140-149, etc., up to 440-449). 5 sets \u00d710=50. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 488-400+1=89 numbers. Correct.\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\n**For eights:**\n- Units place:8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct.\n- Tens place:80-89,180-189,...,480-488. Each set except the last has 10 numbers. The last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4\u00d710 +9=49. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: none, as the book ends at 488. So, 0. Correct.\nTotal eights:49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly for the tens place in eights? Because 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? So, 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the units place for 488, but also 9 eights in the tens place for 480-488. Wait, no, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, that's correct. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one set of 9, totaling 49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. So, the total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Fours are 188. So, 188-98=90.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place for 8. Let me count each set. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place.

Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does that count as the 49th? Let me think: from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers, so the number of 8's in units place is (488 / 10) + 1? Wait, no, that's not right. Actually, the number of 8's in the units place is the number of times 8 appears in the ones digit from 1 to 488. So, for each hundred, there are 10 such numbers (e.g., 8,18,...,98 in the first hundred; 108,118,...,198 in the second, etc.). Let's see how many hundreds we have. 488 pages mean 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. Each of the first four hundreds contributes 10 8's in the units place. So that's 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, how many 8's in the units place? The numbers are 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. Wait, from 408 to 488, every 10 numbers, so that's 9 numbers (since 408 is the first, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488). Wait, let me count: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers. So, total 8's in units place: 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 9 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (40) + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but earlier I thought units place was 49 and tens place was 49, so total 98. But let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So total 8's:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through the 4's again. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? Let's see, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 full cycles, but since 484 is included, it's 49. So, 49 fours in units. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. 49+50+89=188. That seems correct.

Wait, but 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book only goes up to 488, we have 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus the 9 numbers from 480-488.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many sets there are. Each hundred has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488. The last set, 480-488, is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 5 sets, but the last one has 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, let me make sure. Units:49, tens:49, so 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. For the fours: units place: from 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: each hundred has 10, so 400-488: the hundreds digit is 4, so from 400-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, in the tens place, how many 4's? Each hundred block (like 400-499, but we only go up to 488) would have 10 fours in the tens place, but since we stop at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but earlier I considered the tens place as 50 fours. Wait, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me recalculate the tens place for fours. The tens digit is 4 in the following ranges: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours. So that's correct. And the hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Correct. For the eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, totaling 49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, the answer is 90. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any numbers. For example, in the tens place for fours, is 440-449 included? Yes, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. And in the units place, 488 is included, which adds an 8 in the units place. So, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the number of fours exceeds the number of eights by 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The 4 appears in page numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - Number of terms: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49  \n   - Total 4's: 49\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The 4 appears in page numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Each hundred block contributes 10 4's in the tens place.  \n   - Number of sets: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449)  \n   - Total 4's: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The 4 appears in page numbers 400-488.  \n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89  \n   - Total 4's: 89\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The 8 appears in page numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - Number of terms: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49  \n   - Total 8's: 49\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The 8 appears in page numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - Each hundred block contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except the last set which has 9 terms (480-488).  \n   - Number of sets: 5 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488)  \n   - Total 8's: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

Let's count how many sets of 10 there are. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, which is 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. For the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, etc., which is 5 sets of 10, so 50. Units place, every 10 numbers, so 49. 49+50+89=188. For eights, units place: 49, tens place:49, so total 98. 188-98=90.

The last term is 488, which is 48*10 + 8 = 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49.

Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, but let me think again about the units place for fours. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. The number of fours in units place is floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 is included, it's 49. Similarly, for eights, same logic applies. For tens place in fours: from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. For hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. For eights in tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers (480-488). So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many full sets we have. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Wait, that's 98 eights. Wait, did I count correctly? Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, total 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the units place for eights. Let me recount the units place for eights. The last page is 488, so the units digit 8 occurs at 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms can be calculated as ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. Similarly, for the tens place, the numbers are 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one which is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 4*10=40 and 9, total 49. So, that's correct. Therefore, total eights are 49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm getting 90, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to miscount. Let me try another approach. Maybe I can count the number of times each digit appears in each position. For fours: units, tens, hundreds. Units: From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? As before, 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units. Tens: Numbers where tens digit is 4: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5 sets: 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in tens. Hundreds: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. For eights: Units: same as before, 49. Tens: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, and the last set has 9 (since 488 is the last page). So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in tens. Units:49, tens:49, so total eights:98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. I think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks have 10 each, last block has 9: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " How many such numbers? The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Each full set (like 80-89) has 10 eights in the tens place. So, let's see: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 plus 9 is 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total eights are units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Wait, is that correct? Let me add them again: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Hmm, but wait, in the tens place, when we counted 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place for that last partial set. So, total eights in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) and 1 set of 9, so 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, yes, 49 in tens place. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many terms? It's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). So, 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Correct. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. For eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, how many terms? (488 -8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189, etc. Each full block is 10 numbers. There are 4 full blocks (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389), each contributing 10 eights. That's 4*10=40. Then, the last partial block is 480-488, which has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, 9 more. So, 40+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: No eights, as the book doesn't go beyond 488. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each block. 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me go back and check my calculations. For fours: units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for fours and eights. For fours in the tens place, it's 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. That's correct. For eights in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. So, 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Units place for fours: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many? 484-4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. Units place for eights: 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. Hundreds place for fours: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. Hundreds place for eights: none. So, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights, so 90 more fours.
