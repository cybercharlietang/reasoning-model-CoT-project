    "text": " Maybe I should separate the counts based on the number of digits in the page numbers to make it easier.\n\nLet me start with single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the only page numbers that have a 4 or an 8 are 4 and 8 themselves. So, for single-digit pages, there's exactly one 4 and one 8. That means the count so far is 1 for 4 and 1 for 8, making the difference zero. But I think I should check if page 4 and 8 are indeed included. Yes, since 4 and 8 are less than 488, they are part of the book. So, single-digit pages contribute equally to both counts.\n\nNext, I'll move on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should consider each place separately for both digits. Let's start with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in the units place, how many times does 4 appear? From 10 to 99, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 9 times in the units place (since there are 9 decades: 10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, for each decade (like 10-19), the units digit cycles through 0-9, so each digit appears once per decade. There are 9 decades (10-19 up to 90-99), so each digit appears 9 times in the units place. So, the digit 4 appears 9 times in the units place, and the same for the digit 8.\n\nNow, looking at the tens place for two-digit numbers. The tens digit ranges from 1 to 9. For each tens digit, the digit remains the same across all units digits. So, for example, in the 40-49 range, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Therefore, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place for the 40-49 set. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place for the 80-89 set. So, for the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 10 times.\n\nWait, but when I'm considering two-digit numbers from 10 to 99, the tens digit goes from 1 to 9. So, for each digit in the tens place, it appears 10 times. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it's 10 times, same for 8. Therefore, in the two-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 9 (units) + 10 (tens) = 19 times, and the digit 8 appears 9 (units) + 10 (tens) = 19 times. So, again, both digits 4 and 8 appear 19 times in two-digit page numbers. That means the difference remains zero so far.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is where things might get more complicated because the hundreds digit, tens digit, and units digit can vary. I think I should break this down by each digit place separately again.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, page numbers go from 100 to 199, 200 to 299, 300 to 399, and 400 to 488. Now, for the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears only in the 400-488 range. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place for any three-digit page number. Therefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place for three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be from 0 to 9, and the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're dealing with three-digit numbers up to 488, the hundreds digit can only go up to 4, and the tens digit can go up to 8 when the hundreds digit is 4 (since 488 is the last page).\n\nI think I should break this down by hundreds. Let's consider each hundred block separately:\n\n1. 100-199: Here, the hundreds digit is 1. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each hundred. So, for each tens digit (0-9), there are 10 numbers (e.g., 100-109, 110-119, etc.). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It would be once per hundred, specifically in 140-149, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? It would be once per hundred, in 180-189, which is 10 numbers. So, in the 100-199 block, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\n2. 200-299: Similarly, the hundreds digit is 2. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, 4 appears in 240-249 (10 times), and 8 appears in 280-289 (10 times). So, another 10 each.\n\n3. 300-399: Hundreds digit is 3. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, 4 appears in 340-349 (10 times), and 8 appears in 380-389 (10 times). Again, 10 each.\n\n4. 400-488: Here, the hundreds digit is 4. The tens digit can go from 0 to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digits here are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, for the tens digit 4, it's in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For the tens digit 8, it's in 480-488, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, does that mean 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here?\n\nWait, let me check that. From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-488. Since 488 is included, that's 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the digit 8 in the tens place appears 9 times here, whereas the digit 4 in the tens place appears 10 times (440-449).\n\nSo, putting it all together for the tens place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-199: 4 appears 10, 8 appears 10\n- 200-299: 4 appears 10, 8 appears 10\n- 300-399: 4 appears 10, 8 appears 10\n- 400-488: 4 appears 10, 8 appears 9\n\nSo, total for the tens place in three-digit numbers:\n\n4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40\n\n8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 40 times, and 8 appears 39 times.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I did that correctly. Let me double-check. For each hundred block except the last one, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. So, for 100-399, that's three blocks, each contributing 10 for both 4 and 8. So, 3*10=30 for 4 and 30 for 8. Then, in 400-488, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times in the tens place (480-488). So, total for tens place: 30 + 10 = 40 for 4, and 30 + 9 = 39 for 8. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each combination of hundreds and tens digits. So, for each hundreds block, and each tens digit, the units digit cycles through 0-9. Therefore, for each hundreds block, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the units place. But since we have different hundreds blocks, especially the last one (400-488), which is shorter, I need to be careful.\n\nLet me break it down by hundreds block again:\n\n1. 100-199: Here, for each tens digit (0-9), the units digit cycles 0-9. So, for each tens digit, each digit appears once in the units place. There are 10 tens digits, so each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the units place. So, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\n2. 200-299: Same as above. Each digit appears 10 times in the units place. So, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n3. 300-399: Same as above. 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n4. 400-488: Here, the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digits go from 0 to 8. For each tens digit, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, but since the last page is 488, when the tens digit is 8, the units digit only goes up to 8, not 9. So, for the tens digits 0-7, the units digit cycles 0-9, so each digit appears 10 times. But for the tens digit 8, the units digit only goes from 0-8, so each digit from 0-8 appears once, but 9 doesn't appear. So, for the units place in 400-488:\n\n- For tens digits 0-7: Each digit 0-9 appears 1 time per tens digit. There are 8 tens digits (0-7), so each digit appears 8 times.\n\n- For tens digit 8: Units digits 0-8 appear once each. So, digits 0-8 each appear once more, but digits 9 do not.\n\nSo, for digit 4 in the units place in 400-488:\n\n- From tens digits 0-7: 8 times\n\n- From tens digit 8: 1 time (since 484 is within 480-488)\n\nTotal: 8 + 1 = 9 times\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in the units place in 400-488:\n\n- From tens digits 0-7: 8 times\n\n- From tens digit 8: 1 time (488)\n\nTotal: 8 + 1 = 9 times\n\nWait, but wait, when the tens digit is 8, the units digits go from 0-8, so 8 appears once in the units place for that tens digit. So, yes, 8 appears 9 times in the units place in 400-488.\n\nWait, but let me think again. For each tens digit from 0-7, the units digit cycles 0-9, so each digit appears once per tens digit. So, for 8 tens digits (0-7), each digit appears 8 times. Then, for the tens digit 8, the units digits go from 0-8, so each digit from 0-8 appears once. So, for digit 4, in the units place, it appears 8 times (from tens digits 0-7) plus 1 time (from tens digit 8), totaling 9 times. Similarly, for digit 8, it's 8 times (from tens digits 0-7) plus 1 time (from tens digit 8), totaling 9 times.\n\nTherefore, in the units place for three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-399: 4 appears 10 times each, so 3 blocks * 10 = 30 times\n\n- 400-488: 4 appears 9 times\n\nTotal for 4 in units place: 30 + 9 = 39 times\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in units place:\n\n- 100-399: 10 times each, so 3 blocks *10=30\n\n- 400-488: 9 times\n\nTotal for 8 in units place: 30 + 9 = 39 times\n\nWait, but that can't be right because when I add up the units place for 400-488, I thought 4 appears 9 times. But let me double-check:\n\nIn 400-488, the units digit for 4:\n\n- For tens digits 0-7: Each has 4 in units place once, so 8 times.\n\n- For tens digit 8: 484 is the only number with units digit 4, so 1 time.\n\nTotal: 8 +1=9.\n\nSimilarly for 8 in units place:\n\n- For tens digits 0-7: Each has 8 in units place once, so 8 times.\n\n- For tens digit 8: 488 is the only number with units digit 8, so 1 time.\n\nTotal: 8 +1=9.\n\nSo, yes, 4 appears 9 times in the units place in 400-488, and 8 appears 9 times as well. Therefore, in the units place across all three-digit numbers:\n\n4's: 3 blocks *10=30 +9=39\n\n8's: 3 blocks *10=30 +9=39\n\nSo, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 39 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in the units place for 400-488, 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times, so adding to the previous 30 each, making it 39 each. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\n- Units place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n\n4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 89 + 40 = 129; 129 + 39 = 168\n\n8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 0 + 39 = 39; 39 + 39 = 78\n\nWait, that seems like a big difference. So, in three-digit numbers, 4 appears 168 times, and 8 appears 78 times. Hmm, that seems high, but let me check each part again.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, correct because from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times. That seems correct as per the breakdown earlier.\n\nUnits place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers: 168 for 4's, 78 for 8's.\n\nNow, let's add up all the counts from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nSingle-digit:\n\n4's:1, 8's:1\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n4's:19, 8's:19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n4's:168, 8's:78\n\nTotal 4's: 1 +19 +168 = 188\n\nTotal 8's:1 +19 +78 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with single-digit:\n\n4's:1 (page 4)\n\n8's:1 (page 8)\n\nTwo-digit:\n\nUnits place: each digit 0-9 appears 9 times? Wait, earlier I thought that in two-digit numbers, each digit in units place appears 9 times. Wait, no, in two-digit numbers from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers. Each units digit from 0-9 appears exactly 9 times (since 90/10=9). So, 4 appears 9 times in units place, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTens place: from 10-99, the tens digit is 1-9, each appearing 10 times. So, 4 appears 10 times in tens place (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n\nSo, two-digit counts:\n\n4's:9 +10=19\n\n8's:9 +10=19\n\nThat's correct.\n\nThree-digit numbers:\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0.\n\nTens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nUnits place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nSo, 4's:89+40+39=168\n\n8's:0+39+39=78\n\nTotal across all:\n\n4's:1+19+168=188\n\n8's:1+19+78=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place in three-digit numbers. I'm a bit concerned because in the 400-488 block, the units digit for 4 appears 9 times, and for 8, also 9 times. But when I add that to the previous 30 each, I get 39 each. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the units place for three-digit numbers, the first three hundreds (100-399) each contribute 10 times for each digit, so 3*10=30 for both 4 and 8. Then, in 400-488, each contributes 9 times, so 30+9=39 each. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, for 100-399, each hundred contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place, so 3*10=30 each. Then, in 400-488, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times. So, 30+10=40 for 4, and 30+9=39 for 8.\n\nIn the hundreds place, only 4 appears 89 times, 8 doesn't appear.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units)=168\n\n8's:0 +39 +39=78\n\nThen, adding single-digit and two-digit:\n\n4's:1+19=20; 20+168=188\n\n8's:1+19=20; 20+78=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) across single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit page numbers, we find that the digit 4 appears 188 times and the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Single-Digit Pages (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - 8 appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-Digit Pages (10-99):**\n   - **Units Place:** Each digit 0-9 appears 9 times. So, 4 and 8 each appear 9 times.\n   - **Tens Place:** Each digit 1-9 appears 10 times. So, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times.\n   - Total for two-digit pages: 4 (19 times), 8 (19 times).\n\n3. **Three-Digit Pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears 89 times (pages 400-488). 8 doesn't appear here.\n   - **Tens Place:** \n     - 4 appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds (100-399) and 10 times in 400-449, totaling 40 times.\n     - 8 appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds and 9 times in 480-488, totaling 39 times.\n   - **Units Place:** \n     - 4 appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds and 9 times in 400-488, totaling 39 times.\n     - 8 appears similarly, totaling 39 times.\n   - Total for three-digit pages: 4 (168 times), 8 (78 times).\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - 4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n   - 8's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 times more than the digit 8.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can count the occurrences of 4 and 8 separately and then subtract the two totals to find the difference. Let me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears once (e.g., 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8. So, for the units place, I can calculate how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488 and then see how many 4's and 8's are there. Then, I can account for any remaining numbers beyond the last complete set of 10.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place: Every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the same for 8. So, I can calculate how many hundreds there are in 488 and then the number of times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nFor the hundreds place: Since the book has 488 pages, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. But 0 would be for numbers 1-99, so the hundreds digit is only non-zero starting from 100. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (400-488 inclusive). So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book doesn't go up to 800. So, for the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference just from the hundreds place is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut I need to check the other places as well.\n\nLet me structure this properly. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nTotal pages: 488.\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 groups with 8 remaining pages.\n\nIn each group of 10, 4 appears once in the units place, so 48 groups \u00d7 1 = 48 times.\n\nPlus, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear in the units place here? Yes, page 484. So, that's one more. So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: In each group of 10, 8 appears once. So, 48 groups \u00d7 1 = 48.\n\nIn the remaining 8 pages, the units digits go up to 8, so page 488 has 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSo, in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal, each appearing 49 times.\n\nNow, moving to the tens place.\n\nFor the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 488 \u00f7 100 = 4 complete hundreds with 88 remaining pages.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, it's 10 times per hundred, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 pages are from 400 to 488. Wait, no, the remaining after 400 would be 400-488, which is 89 pages. Wait, but 400 is the start of the next hundred, so maybe I should adjust. Wait, actually, when considering the tens place beyond the complete hundreds, I think I need to consider pages from 400 to 488.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me think again. For the tens place, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, for 400-488, that's 89 pages. The tens digit in this range goes from 0 to 8, but let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 pages. The tens digit in this range goes from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 488 is the last page). So, 9 times.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so 480-488 is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages.\n\nSo, in the tens place beyond the complete hundreds (which is 400-488), 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 49 times. So, 4's have 1 more here.\n\nNow, moving to the hundreds place.\n\nAs I thought earlier, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\n8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4, not 8. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, summing up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nTotal pages: 488.\n\nUnits place 4's: Each 10 pages, 1 occurrence. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have 484, which is one more 4. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nUnits place 8's: Similarly, 48 full groups \u00d7 1 = 48. Remaining 8 pages include 488, so 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place. 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) \u00d7 10 each = 40 for 4's and 40 for 8's.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 pages (400-488). Wait, 400-488 is 89 pages, not 88. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages.\n\nIn these 89 pages, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nFor 4 in tens place: 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times.\n\nFor 8 in tens place: 480-488, which is 9 pages (480,481,...,488), so 9 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 400-488, which is 89 pages, the hundreds digit is 4. So, 89 times.\n\n8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the hundreds place would have more 4's, but 90 seems a lot. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the tens place.\n\nWait, in the tens place beyond the hundreds, I considered 400-488 as 89 pages. But when considering the tens digit, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, in 400-499, the tens digit would go from 0-9 ten times each. But since we only go up to 488, the tens digit for 8 would only go up to 488, which is 488, so 480-488 is 9 pages, hence 9 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 4 in the tens place, 440-449 is 10 pages, which is correct.\n\nSo, 50 for 4's and 49 for 8's in the tens place.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the total difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I counted the hundreds place, I considered 400-488 as 89 pages, which is correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full sets, contributing 48 each.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - 4 hundreds (0-399) contribute 40 each.\n   - Pages 400-488: 440-449 (10 4's) and 480-488 (9 8's).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 400-488: 89 pages with 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - No 8's in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately, like units, tens, and hundreds places, for both 4 and 8.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, every 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once. So, in the units place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. So, for every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of an occurrence, I think I need to take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 488 is exactly 48 sets of 10, right? Wait, 48 times 10 is 480, so from 1 to 480, each digit 0-9 appears exactly 48 times in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, from 1 to 488, each 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, same as above, 48 times. But wait, from 481 to 488, the units digit 8 appears once, at 488. So, in total, 48 times for 8's in the units place as well. Wait, but 488 is included, so maybe it's 49 times? Let me check. From 1 to 480, 48 times, and then 488 adds another 8, so 49 times. Hmm, so maybe I was wrong earlier. So, 4's in units place: 48 times, and 8's in units place: 49 times. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so the units digit 8 appears at 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the units place up to 488.\n\nThe number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra in the last partial decade. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8, so 48 times, plus in the last partial decade, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more at 488. So total 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 8's in units place: 49 times, and 4's in units place: 48 times. So, 4's are less than 8's in the units place by 1. But wait, I'm supposed to find how many more 4's than 8's, so maybe I need to check all digit places.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see. From 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so up to 488, we have four complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488.\n\nIn each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So that's 4 times 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8, so 40-49 would be 401-410? Wait, no, the tens digit in 401-488 is from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 481-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 401-410, which is 10 times. Wait, but 488 is 488, so 401-488 includes 401-410, where the tens digit is 0, then 410-420, tens digit 1, etc. Wait, no, the tens digit is determined by the second digit. So, 401-410: tens digit is 0, 411-420: tens digit 1, and so on. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 would be from 440-449, which is 10 numbers: 440-449. So, that's another 10 times. So, total 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 10 = 50 times that 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place. Let's see. In each hundred, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. So, four hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers: 480-488. So, 9 times. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 times that 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 1 to 400, each hundred has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 times because 480 is included and 488 is the last page. So, yes, 49 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo, 4's in tens place: 50 times, and 8's in tens place: 49 times. So, 4's are more by 1 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n- Units place: 4's = 48, 8's = 49\n- Tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49\n- Hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0\n\nNow, let's add them up:\nTotal 4's = 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 49 = 98\n\nSo, total 4's: 187, total 8's: 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step because it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- For 4: From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing 1, so 48 times. But wait, does 488 include another 4? No, because 488 ends with 8, so 4's in units place are 48 times.\n- For 8: Similarly, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing 1, and then in the last partial cycle (481-488), 8 appears once at 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nTens place:\n- For 4: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40 times. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n- For 8: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40 times. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nHundreds place:\n- For 4: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n- For 8: There's no page with 800-899, so 0 times.\n\nAdding up:\n- 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n- 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about units place, I considered 488 as the last page, so 488 is included, which affects the count for 8's in the units place. Similarly, in the tens place, 480-488 affects the count for 8's. So, I think my counts are accurate.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 89 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- **4's:** Occur once every 10 numbers. Total = 488 // 10 = 48 times.\n- **8's:** Similarly, 48 full cycles + 1 in 488, total = 49 times.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- **4's:** Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences. From 1-400: 4*10=40. From 401-488: 10 (440-449). Total = 50.\n- **8's:** Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences. From 1-400: 4*10=40. From 401-488: 9 (480-488). Total = 49.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- **4's:** From 400-488: 89 times.\n- **8's:** No occurrences.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should approach this by counting the number of 4's and 8's separately in each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by counting the 4's.\n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. For example, from 1-10, the 4 is in 4; from 11-20, it's in 14, and so on. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then an additional 8 numbers (481-488). In each complete block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 fours. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the 4 is in 484, which is one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times every 100 numbers. So, for the tens place, a 4 would appear 10 times in every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the 4's in the tens place are 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, from 101-200, it's 140-149, and so on. Now, up to 488, how many hundreds are there? 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, from 1-400, there are 4 complete hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Then, from 401-488, the tens place goes from 0 to 8 in the 400s. The 4 in the tens place would be in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10 fours. So, total 4's in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. Starting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in every block of 10 numbers, there's one 8 in the units place. So, up to 488, there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). Each block contributes one 8, so 48 eights. In the last partial block, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more 8, making it 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, for the tens place, an 8 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. From 1-400, there are 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 eights. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 in the 400s. The 8 in the tens place occurs in 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 480-488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. Wait, no, actually, in the tens place, each digit 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in a hundred, but since we're only going up to 488, in the 400s, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, so the 8 in the tens place occurs in 480-489, but since we stop at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 1-400, in the tens place, each hundred has 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40 + 9 = 49 in the tens place. Units place: 49. So, total 8's are 49 + 49 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total fours are 188 and total eights are 98. The question is how many more fours than eights, so 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again.\n\nFor fours:\n\nUnits place: 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in 481-488, units digits go up to 8, so 484 has a 4, so +1, total 49.\n\nTens place: From 1-400, each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so +10, total 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor eights:\n\nUnits place: 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, 488 has an 8, so +1, total 49.\n\nTens place: From 1-400, each hundred has 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so +9, total 49.\n\nHundreds place: No eights, so 0.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the 4's:**\n- **Units place:** In every 10 numbers, there's one 4. Up to 488, there are 48 complete blocks of 10, contributing 48 fours. The last partial block (481-488) adds one more 4, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** Each hundred contributes 10 fours. From 1-400, that's 40 fours. From 401-488, 440-449 adds 10 fours, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** Numbers 400-488 each have a 4, contributing 89 fours.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the 8's:**\n- **Units place:** Similar to 4's, there are 48 complete blocks contributing 48 eights, plus one in 488, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** Each hundred contributes 10 eights. From 1-400, that's 40 eights. From 401-488, 480-488 adds 9 eights, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No eights as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). So, in the units place, for each digit (4 and 8), there are 48 times they appear, and then in the extra 8 numbers, we have 481, 482, ..., 488. So, in the units place, 481 has a 1, 482 has a 2, and so on up to 488, which has an 8. So, in the units place of the extra 8 numbers, 4 doesn't appear, but 8 does. So, for the units place, 4 appears 48 times, and 8 appears 48 times plus 1 more, making it 49 times. Wait, no, because the extra 8 numbers go up to 488, which is the 488th page. So, the units digits in 481-488 are 1-8, so 8 appears once in the units place there, but 4 doesn't. So, total units place: 4 appears 48 times, 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0-9 ten times each (for 0 in 1-9, 10-19, etc.). So, in each hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 488 pages, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each full hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. So, for 4 full hundreds, that's 4*10=40 times for 4 and 4*10=40 times for 8. Now, the remaining 88 pages (401-488) need to be considered. The tens digit in 401-488 is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., up to 8 for 481-490. But wait, 488 is the end, so the tens digit goes up to 8 in 481-488. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? From 440-449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. Similarly, for 8, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but only 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 times. Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total tens place: 4 appears 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all pages from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4, and 8 isn't in the hundreds place anywhere. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit:\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 187 and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full sets, contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488) add 1 more 8 in the units place.\n   - **Total:** 4's = 48, 8's = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - 4 full hundreds contribute 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - Pages 401-488 add 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - **Total:** 4's = 50, 8's = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 4's.\n   - The digit 8 does not appear here.\n   - **Total:** 4's = 89, 8's = 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract the two counts to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. For each position, I'll calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups and a partial group of 8 numbers (481-488). In each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the digit 8 appears once as well (8, 18, 28, etc.). So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 (from each complete group) plus any additional 4's in the partial group. Similarly for 8's.\n\nWait, let's check the partial group. The last partial group is 481-488. The units digits here are 1-8. So, in the units place, there's a 4 in 484 and an 8 in 488. So that's one more 4 and one more 8. Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and similarly, the total number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because in the units place, each complete group of 10 contributes one 4 and one 8. So, 48 complete groups give 48 4's and 48 8's. Then, the partial group from 481-488 has units digits from 1-8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, same number so far.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each group of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and a partial hundred from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49), so that's 10 4's per hundred, and similarly 10 8's per hundred. So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 4's and 40 8's from the tens place.\n\nNow, the partial hundred is 401-488. Let's look at the tens digit here. The tens digit in 401-409 is 0, 410-419 is 1, 420-429 is 2, and so on up to 480-488. So, the tens digit cycles through 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in this partial hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 4's. Similarly, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the tens place, we have 10 4's and 9 8's in the partial hundred.\n\nWait, but in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, contributing 10 4's. The tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, contributing 9 8's. So, adding to the previous 40 from complete hundreds, the total 4's in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's would be 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Each complete hundred (1-100, etc.) contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 complete hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the partial hundred 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449 (10 numbers) and 8 for 480-488 (9 numbers). So, adding 10 to 40 gives 50 for 4's, and 9 to 40 gives 49 for 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89), so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. How about 8's in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- Each 10 numbers contribute one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8.\n- So, 48 4's and 48 8's from full groups.\n- The partial group is 481-488, which has units digits 1-8.\n- So, 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8.\n- So, units place: 48 +1=49 4's, 48 +1=49 8's.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n- 4 full hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40 4's and 40 8's.\n- Partial hundred 401-488:\n  - Tens digit 4: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n  - Tens digit 8: 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's.\n- So, total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50\n- Total 8's in tens place: 40 +9=49\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n- Hundreds digit 8 never occurs, so 0 8's.\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 -98 =90.\n\nWait, but let me check the partial hundreds again. From 401-488, when looking at the tens digit:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: tens digit 1\n- 421-430: tens digit 2\n- 431-440: tens digit 3\n- 441-450: tens digit 4\nWait, no, 441-450 would have tens digit 4? Wait, no, 441 is 44 in the tens place, so 441-450 would have tens digit 4. So, from 440-449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, 480-488: tens digit is 8, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 480 is included, right? So, 480 is the first, then 481, up to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nHmm, I think my calculations are correct. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can check with a smaller number. Let's say a book with 20 pages. How many 1's and 2's would there be? Let's see:\n\nPage numbers 1-20.\n\nCount of 1's:\nUnits place: 1,11,21 (but 21 is beyond 20, so 1 and 11: 2 times.\nTens place: 10-19: 10 times.\nTotal 1's: 2 +10=12.\n\nCount of 2's:\nUnits place: 2,12: 2 times.\nTens place: 20: 1 time.\nTotal 2's: 2 +1=3.\n\nDifference:12-3=9.\n\nWait, but according to my method:\n\nUnits place:\n20/10=2 full groups, each contributing 1 1 and 1 2.\nPartial group 21-20: none, since 20 is the end.\nWait, no, 20 is the last page, so units digits from 1-0 (since 20 ends with 0). So, units place for 1's: 1,11: 2 times. For 2's: 2,12: 2 times.\n\nTens place:\n2 full hundreds? No, 20 is only two digits. So, 1-9: no tens digit. 10-19: tens digit 1, 10 times. 20: tens digit 2, 1 time.\n\nSo, 1's in tens place:10, 2's in tens place:1.\n\nTotal 1's: units (2) + tens (10) =12.\n\nTotal 2's: units (2) + tens (1) =3.\n\nDifference:9. So, correct.\n\nSimilarly, using my method, it works for 20 pages. So, I think my method is correct.\n\nTherefore, applying it to 488 pages, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each group of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full groups, contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - The partial group (481-488) adds one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - 4 full hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - The partial hundred (401-488) adds 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 400-488 contributes 89 4's.\n   - No page numbers have an 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately\u2014units, tens, hundreds. Let me try that approach.\n\nStarting with the units place. For each set of ten numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. But wait, I should check if this holds true all the way up to 488. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and an extra 8 pages (481-488). So, in each of these 48 sets, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484) and 8 appears once more (488). So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's are 48 + 1 = 49 as well. So, in the units place, 4 and 8 appear the same number of times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0-9 ten times each. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). Now, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, each hundred (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. That's 4 hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40 for both 4's and 8's. But wait, the last hundred is 301-400, and then we have 401-488. So, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in 401-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, from 400-409, the tens digit is 0, but 400 is included, but 401-409 would have 4 in the hundreds place, but the tens digit is 0. Wait, actually, the tens digit in 401-488 is from 0 to 8, but 401-409 is part of 401-488. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, right? So that's 10 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, for the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times in 440-449. So, total tens place 4's are 4*10 (from 1-400) plus 10 from 401-488, totaling 50. Wait, but 401-488 is part of the 400-488 range, so maybe I should adjust. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that in 1-400, the tens digit 4 appears 4 times 10 (once per hundred), so 40 times, and then in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), so total 50. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, in 1-400, it's 4*10=40, and in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 times. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 of them. So, total tens place 8's are 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49. Wait, that seems different. So, tens place 4's: 50, 8's: 49. Hmm, that's a difference.\n\nWait, let me check again. In 1-400, each hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds, so 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. For 8's, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488). So, that's 9 times. So, 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. So, the 4's have 50 and 8's have 49 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case. For 488 pages, the hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 times. How about 8's in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would be where 8 appears in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, so 89 times. 8's in hundreds place: 0, since 800 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, now, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I count the units place correctly? Let me double-check.\n\nEarlier, I thought that in the units place, each set of ten has one 4 and one 8. So, for 488 pages, there are 48 complete sets of ten (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488). So, in the units place, 48 sets * 1 = 48 for both 4 and 8. Then, in the extra 8 pages, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place 4's: 48 +1=49, 8's:48 +1=49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For 4's, in each hundred, 10 times in the tens place (40-49). So, 4 hundreds (1-400) gives 40, plus in 401-488, 440-449 is another 10, so total 50. For 8's, in each hundred, 10 times in the tens place (80-89). So, 4 hundreds gives 40, plus in 401-488, 480-488 is 9 times, so total 49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4's appear 89 times (400-488), and 8's don't appear at all, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For example, in the hundreds place, is 400-488 exactly 89 pages? Let me check: 488 - 400 +1 = 89. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother check: Let's think about the total number of digits printed. Each page from 1-9 has 1 digit, 10-99 has 2 digits, and 100-488 has 3 digits.\n\nNumber of pages:\n- 1-9: 9 pages, each with 1 digit: 9 digits\n- 10-99: 90 pages, each with 2 digits: 180 digits\n- 100-488: 389 pages, each with 3 digits: 1167 digits\nTotal digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits.\n\nNow, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90. But let me just confirm that 188 and 98 are correct.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in units place:\n\nFor each ten numbers, 4 appears once. So, total number of tens in 488 pages is 48 full tens (480 pages) and 8 extra pages. So, 48 times from the full tens, plus 1 from the extra 8 pages (484). So, 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: 48 from full tens, plus 1 from the extra 8 pages (488), so 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nIn each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49). So, 4 hundreds (1-400) gives 40 times. Then, in 401-488, 440-449 is another 10 times, so total 50.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: Each hundred has 10 times (80-89). So, 4 hundreds give 40 times. Then, in 401-488, 480-488 is 9 times (since 488 is the last page). So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times.\n\n8's don't appear in hundreds place, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Let me think again. In 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's correct. So, 40 from 1-400 plus 10 from 401-488 gives 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place, 40 from 1-400, and in 401-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 49.\n\nSo, yeah, I think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal: 49 +50 +89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal:49 +49 +0 =98\n\nDifference:188 -98 =90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of ten numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) contains one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of ten in 480 pages, contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488).\n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contains ten 4's and ten 8's in the tens place (e.g., 40-49 and 80-89).\n   - For 400 pages, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, totaling 40 each.\n   - In 401-488, 440-449 adds 10 more 4's, while 480-488 adds 9 more 8's.\n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 40 + 10 = 50\n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n   - There are no 8's in the hundreds place within 488.\n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89\n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block, the digit 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.) and the digit 8 appears once (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). I should calculate how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488 pages and then see how many extra pages are left after that.\n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So there are 48 complete blocks of 10 pages each and then 8 extra pages. In each block, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1, which is 48, plus any additional 4's in the extra 8 pages. The extra pages are 481 to 488, so the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, there's a 4 in 484, so that's one more. So total 4's in units place would be 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, for 8's, in each block, there's one 8, so 48 times 1 is 48, and in the extra pages, the units digit 8 appears in 488, so that's one more. So, 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both 4's and 8's appear 49 times. Hmm, so they are equal here.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each block of 100 pages has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears from 40-49, which is 10 times, and similarly, 8 appears from 80-89, which is 10 times. Now, since the book has 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (like 40-49 in each hundred), so 4 times 10 is 40. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, so 4 times 10 is 40. Now, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, in the tens place, we have 40-49 in this block, which is 10 times, but wait, 401-488 includes 401-409, 410-419, etc., up to 480-488. Wait, no, the tens digit in 401-488 would be from 0 to 8. So, the digit 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the incomplete hundred, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times and 8 occurs 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit, like 0, 1, 2, ..., 8, each appears 10 times except for the last one, which might be shorter. Wait, no, actually, in 401-488, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last tens digit, which is 8, but 488 is the end, so from 480 to 488 is 9 pages, not 10. So, for the tens digit 8 in 401-488, it's 9 times. So, in the tens place, for the incomplete hundred, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens digit 4's: 4 complete hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the incomplete hundred, so total 50. Tens digit 8's: 4 complete hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 9 in the incomplete hundred, so total 49. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. So, 4's are more by 1 here.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, in 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, which we can ignore. From 100 onwards, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, let's see. How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). Wait, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nHow about the hundreds digit 8? Well, in 1-488, the hundreds digit can only be up to 4, because 488 is less than 500. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds digit 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times and 8's appear 0 times. So, that's a difference of 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 488 pages. Each 10 pages, 1 four and 1 eight. 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1 four and 1 eight. So, 48 fours and 48 eights. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1-8. So, 484 has a 4, so that's 1 more four, making units fours 49. For eights, 488 has an 8, so units eights are 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. 4 full hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40 fours and 40 eights. Then, the last partial hundred (401-488) has tens digits from 0-8. So, the fours in tens place occur in 440-449, which is 10 times. Eights occur in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, tens fours: 40 +10=50, tens eights:40 +9=49. That's correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 pages. So, 89 fours. No hundreds digit 8's in 1-488. So, 0 eights.\n\nTotal fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n\nBut wait, let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. The tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. That seems correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is right. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place Analysis:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages contributes one '4' and one '8' in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n   - '4' appears once in the extra pages (484).\n   - '8' appears once in the extra pages (488).\n   - **Total '4's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n   - **Total '8's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place Analysis:**\n   - Each block of 100 pages has 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 complete hundreds (400 pages), contributing 40 '4's and 40 '8's.\n   - In the partial hundred (401-488), '4' appears 10 times (440-449) and '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - **Total '4's in tens place:** 40 + 10 = 50\n   - **Total '8's in tens place:** 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place Analysis:**\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is '4', appearing 89 times.\n   - There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n   - **Total '4's in hundreds place:** 89\n   - **Total '8's in hundreds place:** 0\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by considering each place one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of ten numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place, same with 8. So, how many complete groups of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each of these 48 groups, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, that's 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 8 appears once in the units place (488), and the digit 4 doesn't appear in the units place here because the numbers are 481-488, so units digits are 1-8, and 4 is in the hundreds place? Wait, no, 481 is 4,8,1, so the units digit is 1, 482 is 2, etc., up to 488. So, in the units place, from 481-488, the digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, in total, for the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, they're equal in the units place.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89). Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. So that's 4*10 = 40 for both 4 and 8 in the tens place. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Let's see: 440-449 would have 4 in the tens place, which is 10 numbers, but wait, our range is 401-488. So, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. Similarly, 480-488 would have 8 in the tens place, which is 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480 is included, so that's 9 times. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, in the tens place for 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). Therefore, in the tens place, 4 appears 40 + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 40 + 9 = 49 times. So, 4 has 50 and 8 has 49 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, which we can ignore. From 100-488, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, how about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The hundreds digit goes from 1 to 4, and 8 is beyond 488, so yes, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, so 4's are 188 and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n- Each group of 10 has one 4 and one 8. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1 to both 4 and 8, so 48 each. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 +1 =49 for 4, same for 8.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place. 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, 40 +10=50 for 4, 40 +9=49 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times.\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 49 +50 +89=188\n8's:49 +49 +0=98\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each group of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10 in 488, contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total: 49 each.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place.\n   - Four complete hundreds contribute 40 each.\n   - In 401-488, 440-449 adds 10 more 4's, and 480-488 adds 9 8's.\n   - Total: 50 for 4's, 49 for 8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Let me start with the units place because that might be straightforward.\n\nFor the units place, in every set of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears once, right? Like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once every ten numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then an extra 8 pages. But wait, the last set isn't complete because it only goes up to 488, which is the 489th page? Wait, no, 488 is the last page. So, actually, there are 48 complete sets of ten (each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place) and then an incomplete set from 481 to 488. Let me check: from 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of ten, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So that's 48 fours and 48 eights. Now, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So in this range, the units digit 4 appears once (484) and the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, adding those, total units place fours would be 48 + 1 = 49, and units place eights would be 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, the number of 4's and 8's is the same. \n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of ten numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last block would be 440-449, right? So, each of these blocks contributes ten 4's in the tens place. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the blocks are:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place, the blocks would be 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many blocks? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers\n\nSo that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, the number of 8's in the tens place would be 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 10 eights in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189 is another 10, and so on. Then 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So total eights in tens place: 4\u00d710 +9=49.\n\nSo, fours in tens place: 50, eights in tens place:49. So, in the tens place, there are 50 fours and 49 eights.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can't be 8. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the fours and eights.\n\nTotal fours:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal fours = 49 +50 +89 = 188.\n\nTotal eights:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal eights =49 +49 +0=98.\n\nSo, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 48 complete sets of ten, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then from 481-488, 484 adds one more 4, and 488 adds one more 8. So, units place fours:48 +1=49, units place eights:48 +1=49. That's correct.\n\nTens place: fours are in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So 5\u00d710=50 fours in tens place. Correct.\n\nEights in tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's five blocks, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so 4 blocks of 10 and one of 9. So, 4\u00d710=40 and 9, total 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: fours are from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. Eights in hundreds place: none, so zero.\n\nSo total fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal eights:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Let me check each digit place again.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, 484 is the only one with 4 in units place. So total 48+1=49 fours. Similarly, 8's in units place: same logic, 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then from 481-488, 488 has 8 in units place, so 48+1=49. So units place: both 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFours: every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. Wait, but actually, 400-488 is part of the hundreds place as 4. So, let me think differently. The tens digit is 4 in the ranges:\n\n40-49: 10 numbers\n140-149:10\n240-249:10\n340-349:10\n440-449:10\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5\u00d710=50. Correct.\n\nEights in tens place:\n\n80-89:10\n180-189:10\n280-289:10\n380-389:10\n480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one of 9. So, 4\u00d710=40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours in hundreds place. Eights in hundreds place: none, since the book ends at 488. So, zero.\n\nSo, total fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal eights:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of fours printed is 90 more than the number of eights.\n\nBut let me just verify once more to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of fours and eights separately.\n\nNumber of fours:\n\nUnits place: floor(488/10)=48, plus 1 if the last page is >=484. Since 488>=484, so 48+1=49.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours:40+10=50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nNumber of eights:\n\nUnits place: floor(488/10)=48, plus 1 if last page >=488. Since 488 is included, so 48+1=49.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers. In 1-100, 80-89:10. 101-200:180-189:10. 201-300:280-289:10. 301-400:380-389:10. Then, in 401-488:480-488:9. So, 4\u00d710=40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: none, so 0.\n\nTotal eights:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** 48 complete sets of ten (1-480) contribute 48 fours. The range 481-488 adds one more (484), totaling 49.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, 48 complete sets contribute 48 eights. The range 481-488 adds one more (488), totaling 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each hundred block (e.g., 40-49) contributes 10 fours. With five such blocks (40-49, 140-149, etc.), we get 50 fours.\n   - **8's:** Each hundred block (e.g., 80-89) contributes 10 eights. With four complete blocks and 480-488 contributing 9, we get 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** Pages 400-488 contribute 89 fours.\n   - **8's:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by considering each place one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, in every block of 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once. So, for example, from 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once. Now, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times, except for 0, which appears 48 times as well because 480 is included. Wait, no, actually, from 1-488, the units digit cycles 48 times through 0-9, but since we start at 1, the first block is 1-10, so each digit 1-9 appears once in the units place for each block. So, in 48 complete blocks, each digit 1-9 appears 48 times in the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, the digit 4 appears once more, and the digit 8 appears once more. Therefore, total 4's in units place: 48 (from blocks) + 1 (from last partial block) = 49. Similarly, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so so far, both 4 and 8 have 49 each in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in every block of 100. For example, from 1-100, the tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. But wait, from 1-99, the tens digit is 0 for pages 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for every 100 numbers. Now, in 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, for the tens place, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred. So, in 400 pages, each digit would appear 4*10 = 40 times in the tens place. Then, from 401-488, we have 88 more pages. The tens digit here would go from 0 (for 401-410) to 8 (for 480-488). Wait, no, let's think again. From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) to 8 (480-488). So, each tens digit from 0-8 appears 10 times, except for 8, which appears 9 times because 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, from 400-488, the digit 0 appears 10 times (400-409), 1 appears 10 times (410-419), and so on up to 8, which appears 9 times (480-488). So, total for the tens place in 400-488: digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times. Therefore, the total for the tens place across all 488 pages would be: from 1-399, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times (since 399 is 3 hundreds, 9 tens, 9 units; so 3*10=30 times? Wait, no, wait. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to split the page numbers into hundreds. So, 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nFor each of these ranges, I can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nStarting with 1-99:\n\n- The tens digit cycles from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, in 1-99, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n\nNext, 100-199:\n\n- The tens digit again cycles 0-9 for each hundred. So, 4 appears 10 times (140-149), and 8 appears 10 times (180-189).\n\nSimilarly, 200-299:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times (240-249), and 8 appears 10 times (280-289).\n\n300-399:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times (340-349), and 8 appears 10 times (380-389).\n\nNow, 400-488:\n\n- The tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, for the tens place:\n\n  - Digit 0: 10 times (400-409)\n  - Digit 1: 10 times (410-419)\n  - ...\n  - Digit 7: 10 times (470-479)\n  - Digit 8: 9 times (480-488)\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nWait, but in 400-488, the tens digit for 4 is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For 8, it's in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, adding up all the tens places:\n\n- For 4: 10 (1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 50 times.\n- For 8: 10 (1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 49 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. Let's see:\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, which we can ignore since we're only counting 4 and 8.\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so neither 4 nor 8.\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, same.\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, same.\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears for all pages from 400-488. How many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is either 1,2,3, or 4. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences of 4 and 8 across all digit places.\n\nFor 4:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n- Each block of 10 has one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 pages mean 48 full blocks (1-480) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n- So, units place: 48*1 + 1 (for 484) = 49 for 4; similarly, 48*1 +1 (for 488) = 49 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For each hundred (1-99, 100-199, etc.), each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 and 8, that's 10 each per hundred. There are 4 full hundreds (1-399), so 4*10=40 each. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit for 4 is 4 in 440-449 (10 times), and for 8, it's in 480-488 (9 times). So, total tens place: 40 +10=50 for 4; 40 +9=49 for 8. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- Only 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, which is 89 pages. So, 89 times. 8 never appears here.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused about the hundreds place. Let me check again. From 400-488, how many numbers are there? 488-400+1=89. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: for the hundreds digit, only 4 appears 89 times, and 8 doesn't appear at all. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the tens place again. In 400-488, when considering the tens digit, for 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers, so 9 times. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the units digit in 400-488, the 8 appears once in 488, so units digit adds 1 more 8, making it 49 total.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought that in the units place, from 1-488, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in each place, except for the last partial block. Wait, maybe I should think of it as:\n\nTotal numbers = 488.\n\nFor units digit:\n\n- Each digit 0-9 appears floor(488/10)=48 times, with a remainder of 8. So, digits 1-8 appear one more time in the units place because the last block ends at 488, which is units digit 8. So, digits 1-8 each appear 49 times in the units place, and 9 and 0 appear 48 times.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier calculation. Hmm, now I'm confused.\n\nWait, let's recalculate the units digit properly.\n\nEach page number from 1 to N, where N=488.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nThe number of times each digit d appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus 1 if d \u2264 (N mod 10).\n\nWait, more accurately, it's floor((N + 10 - d)/10). Wait, maybe an easier way is to note that for each digit d from 0 to 9, the count is:\n\ncount = (N // 10) + (1 if (d <= (N % 10)) else 0)\n\nBut since we're starting from 1, not 0, we have to adjust. Wait, no, because page 1 is 1, so the units digits go from 1 to 9 in the first block, then 0-9 in each subsequent block.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of it as:\n\nFor units digit, the number of times digit d appears is:\n\n- If d=0: floor(N/10)\n- Else: floor((N + 10 - d)/10)\n\nWait, let me test this formula.\n\nFor N=488, d=4:\n\ncount = floor((488 + 10 -4)/10) = floor(494/10)=49.4 => 49.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8:\n\ncount = floor((488 +10 -8)/10)=floor(490/10)=49.\n\nSo, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place. That's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nSimilarly, for d=9:\n\ncount = floor((488 +10 -9)/10)=floor(489/10)=48.9 =>48.\n\nSo, 9 appears 48 times in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, d=0:\n\ncount = floor(488/10)=48.\n\nSo, 0 appears 48 times in the units place.\n\nTherefore, in the units place, 4 and 8 each appear 49 times. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\nThe formula is similar but for tens digit. The count for digit d in the tens place is:\n\ncount = floor((N / 100) * 10) + extra.\n\nWhere extra depends on the tens digit in the remaining part.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to consider that for each hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for N=488, which is 4 hundreds and 88 pages into the fifth hundred.\n\nSo, the number of complete hundreds is 4 (1-400), and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40 times each for digits 0-9 in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). Each tens digit from 0-8 appears 10 times except for 8, which appears 9 times because 480-488 is only 9 numbers.\n\nWait, no, 401-488 is 88 numbers. Let's see:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10)\n- ...\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 numbers, but wait, 480 is included? Wait, 480 is part of 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 numbers. So, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). Each tens digit from 0-7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times. So, in the tens place for 401-488:\n\n- 0:10\n- 1:10\n- ...\n- 7:10\n- 8:9\n\nSo, total for the tens place in 401-488:\n\nDigits 0-7: 10 each\nDigit 8:9\n\nTherefore, for the tens place across all 488 pages:\n\n- Digits 0-9: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (for 401-488) for digits 0-7, and 40 +9=49 for digit 8.\n\nWait, no, wait. From 1-400, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place. Then, from 401-488, digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, and 8 appears 9 times. So, total for each digit:\n\n- For digits 0-7: 40 +10=50\n- For digit 8:40 +9=49\n- For digit 9:40 (since 401-488 doesn't include any tens digit 9)\n\nWait, but in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so digit 9 doesn't appear. So, digit 9 in the tens place only appears in the hundreds 1-399, where 90-99, 190-199, etc.\n\nWait, but in our earlier calculation, we considered that from 1-399, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place. But actually, for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) would have each digit appearing 40 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 400 is part of the 400-488 range, so maybe I'm double-counting. Wait, no, 1-400 includes 1-399 and 400. So, in 1-399, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place? Wait, no, 1-99: each digit appears 10 times, 100-199: another 10, 200-299: another 10, 300-399: another 10. So, 4 times 10=40. So, yes, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place from 1-399.\n\nThen, from 400-488, as we calculated, digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, and 8 appears 9 times. So, for the tens place:\n\n- Digit 4: 40 (from 1-399) +10 (from 400-488, in 440-449) =50\n- Digit 8:40 (from 1-399) +9 (from 400-488, in 480-488) =49\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the hundreds place, as we calculated, digit 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and digit 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total counts:\n\n4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal=49+50+89=188\n\n8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal=49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe the hundreds place for 4 is 89, which is correct because 488-400+1=89. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, yes, the total difference is 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place for the first 480 pages.\n   - From 481-488, digits 1-8 each appear once more.\n   - **4's:** 48 + 1 = 49\n   - **8's:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred.\n   - From 1-399: 40 times each for 4 and 8.\n   - From 400-488: 4 appears 10 times (440-449), 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - **4's:** 40 + 10 = 50\n   - **8's:** 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **4's:** 89\n   - **8's:** 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract the two counts to find the difference. Let me start by counting the number of 4's. \n\nFirst, let's consider the single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. The only single-digit number that has a 4 is 4 itself. So, there's one 4 in the single-digit pages. Now, moving on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. In two-digit numbers, the 4 can appear in the tens place or the units place. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers from 40 to 49 all have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so that's 10 occurrences of 4. \n\nFor the units place: The numbers where the units digit is 4 are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, and 94. Wait, but wait, from 10 to 99, the numbers ending with 4 are 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences of 4. But wait, 44 has two 4's, so does that mean I should count it twice? Hmm, maybe I should think of it as each digit separately. So, in the units place, each occurrence is a separate digit, so 44 contributes one 4 in the tens place and one in the units place. But when I'm counting the tens place, I already counted the 44 as part of the 40-49 range. So, in the units place, I should count all numbers where the units digit is 4, regardless of the tens digit. So from 10 to 99, that's 9 numbers: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. So that's 9 4's in the units place. So, for two-digit numbers, the total 4's are 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. \n\nWait, but 44 has two 4's, so does that mean I'm double-counting it? Let me check: when I count the tens place, 44 is included in the 40-49 range, so that's one 4. Then, in the units place, 44 is also included, so that's another 4. So, in total, 44 contributes two 4's, which is correct. So, 10 + 9 = 19 4's in two-digit numbers. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complicated because there are three places: hundreds, tens, and units. Let me break it down by each place.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, let's consider each possibility.\n\nFor hundreds digit 1: 100-199. In this range, the hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nFor hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Similarly, hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's here either. 0 occurrences.\n\nFor hundreds digit 3: 300-399. Hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's. 0 occurrences.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Now, the hundreds digit is 4, so every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place in three-digit numbers (100-488). The tens digit can be 0-9, and we're looking for when it's 4. Let's consider each hundred range:\n\nFor hundreds digit 1: 100-199. The tens digit can be 0-9, so the numbers where tens digit is 4 are 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place.\n\nFor hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Similarly, the tens digit 4 occurs in 240-249, another 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\nFor hundreds digit 3: 300-399. The tens digit 4 occurs in 340-349, another 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: 400-488. The tens digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the last). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, 10 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 10 (hundreds 4) = 40 4's in the tens place across all three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but wait, in the hundreds digit 4 range (400-488), the tens digit can go up to 8, so when the tens digit is 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, for the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, considering each hundred range:\n\nFor hundreds digit 1: 100-199. The units digit is 4 in numbers like 104,114,124,...,194. How many are there? From 104 to 194, stepping by 10, that's (194 - 104)/10 + 1 = (90)/10 + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10 numbers. So, 10 4's in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Units digit 4 occurs in 204,214,...,294. That's another 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\nFor hundreds digit 3: 300-399. Units digit 4 occurs in 304,314,...,394. Again, 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Now, the units digit 4 occurs in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Wait, but 484 is within 488, so that's okay. Let me count: starting from 404, adding 10 each time until 484. So, 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers. Wait, because 484 +10 would be 494, which is beyond 488, so we stop at 484. So, that's 9 numbers, meaning 9 4's in the units place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check: from 400-488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first occurrence is 404, then 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers. So, 9 4's in the units place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, total units place 4's in three-digit numbers: 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 9 (hundreds 4) = 39 4's.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check. For hundreds digits 1,2,3, each contributes 10 units place 4's, so that's 30. For hundreds digit 4, it's 9. So total 39. Hmm, but wait, in the hundreds digit 4 range, from 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs in 404,414,...,484. Let me count them: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 4's. So, yes, 39 in total.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place: 89\n\nTens place: 40\n\nUnits place: 39\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 + (89 + 40 + 39) = 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that addition again. 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. Then 1 + 19 is 20, plus 168 is 188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's. I need to count how many times 8 appears in page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nStarting with single-digit: page 8 is the only single-digit page with an 8. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: from 10 to 99.\n\nIn the tens place: numbers from 80-89 have 8 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\nIn the units place: numbers where the units digit is 8, regardless of the tens digit. So, 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 8's. But wait, 88 has two 8's, so does that mean I'm double-counting? Let me think: when I count the tens place, 88 is included in the 80-89 range, so that's one 8. Then, in the units place, 88 is also included, so that's another 8. So, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nWait, but 88 is in both counts, but that's correct because it has two 8's. So, total 19 8's in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers: 100-488.\n\nAgain, let's break it down by hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4.\n\nFor hundreds digit 1: 100-199. The hundreds digit is 1, so no 8's here. 0.\n\nFor hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Hundreds digit is 2, so no 8's. 0.\n\nFor hundreds digit 3: 300-399. Hundreds digit is 3, so no 8's. 0.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Hundreds digit is 4, so no 8's here either. 0.\n\nSo, total 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nTens place in three-digit numbers:\n\nFor hundreds digit 1: 100-199. The tens digit is 8 in 180-189. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\nFor hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Tens digit 8 occurs in 280-289, another 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\nFor hundreds digit 3: 300-399. Tens digit 8 occurs in 380-389, another 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Tens digit can be 0-8. So, tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 8's in the tens place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 9 (hundreds 4) = 39.\n\nUnits place in three-digit numbers:\n\nFor hundreds digit 1: 100-199. Units digit 8 occurs in 108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\nFor hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Units digit 8 occurs in 208,218,...,298. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\nFor hundreds digit 3: 300-399. Units digit 8 occurs in 308,318,...,398. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Units digit 8 occurs in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Let's count: starting from 408, adding 10 each time up to 488. So, 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 8's.\n\nSo, total units place 8's: 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 9 (hundreds 4) = 39.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n\nTens place: 39\n\nUnits place: 39\n\nSo, total 8's: 1 + 19 + (39 + 39) = 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that addition again. 39 + 39 is 78, plus 19 is 97, plus 1 is 98. So, total 8's: 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds: 89\n\nTens: 40\n\nUnits: 39\n\nTotal: 1+19=20; 89+40=129; 129+39=168; 20+168=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:\n\nTens:39\n\nUnits:39\n\nTotal:1+19=20; 39+39=78; 20+78=98. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the three-digit counts, especially for the hundreds place.\n\nFor 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right because 488 - 400 +1 = 89.\n\nFor 8's in the hundreds place, none, since the hundreds digit goes up to 4.\n\nIn the tens place for 4's, I had 40, which is 10 for each hundreds digit 1,2,3,4 except that in hundreds digit 4, the tens digit can only go up to 8, so 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for units place in 4's, in hundreds digit 4, it's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one, so that's correct.\n\nSame for 8's: in hundreds digit 4, the tens place 8's are 480-488, which is 9 numbers, and units place 8's are 408,418,...,488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nI think that's all correct. So, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Let me start by considering each position one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: For any range of numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in the units place every 10 numbers. So, in the units place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. The number of times 4 appears in the units place would be the number of complete groups of 10, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a time, I think it's 48 times for each digit. Wait, but 488 is the last number, so let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 more numbers. In each group of 10, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 times, and then in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once more in 484. So, total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, for 8's in the units place, it's the same logic: 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48 times, and in the last 8 numbers, 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place: both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. So, the count is equal here, so no difference yet.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's think: from 1 to 488, how many hundreds do we have? We have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, for each of the first four hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Then, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place: in each hundred, 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the last 88 pages, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. Wait, no: 480-488 has the tens digit as 8, so that's 9 numbers, but actually, from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers. So, that's 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 400-488 includes 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? Wait, no, 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, in the tens place, 8 appears from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 times. So, 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 9 = 49. So, tens place: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times. So, 4 is ahead by 1 here.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. For the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 4 appears in the hundreds place. So, 1 appears 100 times (1-99: wait, no, the hundreds digit is 0 for 1-99, so actually, 100-199 have 1 in the hundreds place, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4. So, for the hundreds place, 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 +1). So, 89 times. For 8's in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up all the places:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, subtracting the total 8's from total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nFirst, units place: 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times. Correct.\n\nTens place: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times. So, 4 is ahead by 1.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. So, 4 is way ahead here.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the tens place again for 8's. When calculating the tens place for 8's, I considered that in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. But wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so that's 9 times. So, 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, in the last 88 pages, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 times, adding to the 40 from the first four hundreds, making 50. Correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- **4's:** Occur once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Let me start by thinking about the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each set of ten numbers. So, in the range from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers. In each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1, which is 48, plus any extra 4's in the last partial set. The last partial set is 481-488, so the units digits here are 1 through 8. So, there's a 4 in the units place at 484, which is one more. So, total 4's in units place would be 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, for 8's in the units place, each set of ten has one 8, so 48 times 1 is 48, and in the last partial set, 488 is the last page, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total 8's in units place would be 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, so both 4's and 8's have 49 in the units place? That seems the same, so maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. From 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of ten, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So yes, both add one more, making it 49 each. So, units place: 49 fours, 49 eights. Now, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears ten times in each hundred. So, in the tens place, for each hundred, like 0-99, 100-199, etc., each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). Wait, actually, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages, so the hundreds go up to 400, and then 401-488 is the next part. So, for the tens place, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for each hundred, that's 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. Now, how many complete hundreds are there? From 1 to 400, that's four hundreds. So, in each of these four hundreds, the tens place has 10 fours and 10 eights. So, that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours and 40 eights from the tens place in the first 400 pages. Now, what about the remaining 88 pages, from 401 to 488? Let's see, the tens digit in these pages would go from 0 to 8. So, for the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, 488 is only up to 488, so 440-449 is within 401-488. So, the digit 4 in the tens place appears 10 times here. Similarly, the digit 8 in the tens place would appear in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 times (480-488). So, in the tens place for the last 88 pages, we have 10 fours and 9 eights. Therefore, total fours in the tens place would be 40 (from the first 400) + 10 = 50. And total eights in the tens place would be 40 + 9 = 49. So, in the tens place, fours are 50 and eights are 49. So, fours are one more in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for numbers 100 and above. So, from 1 to 99, the hundreds digit is 0, which doesn't contribute to any fours or eights. From 100 to 488, the hundreds digit cycles through 1, 2, 3, and 4. So, for each hundred, the hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does the digit 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. How about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's in the hundreds place are zero.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences of 4's and 8's across all digit places.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n- 4's: 48 sets of ten (each contributing one 4) + 1 in 484 = 49\n- 8's: 48 sets of ten + 1 in 488 = 49\n\nTens place:\n- For the first 400 pages: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 fours and 10 eights, so 4*10=40 each\n- From 401-488: tens place 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488)\n- So, 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488)\n- 8 appears 0 times\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nI think that's correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference between them.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full sets and 8 extra pages.\n   - **4's:** 48 (from full sets) + 1 (484) = 49\n   - **8's:** 48 (from full sets) + 1 (488) = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - For the first 400 pages: 4 sets of 100, contributing 40 each.\n   - From 401-488: 4's appear 10 times (440-449), 8's appear 9 times (480-488).\n   - **4's:** 40 + 10 = 50\n   - **8's:** 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400-488 (89 times).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **4's:** 89\n   - **8's:** 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately\u2014units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by considering each place one by one for both 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, like 4, 14, 24, etc. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once in the units place, like 8, 18, 28, etc. Now, I need to figure out how many complete sets of ten there are in 488 pages. Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and then 8 more numbers (481-488). In each complete set, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 sets, that's 48 4's and 48 8's in the units place. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the units digit 4 appears once (484) and the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, adding that, the total for units place is 48 + 1 = 49 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 8's. Wait, that seems like the same number. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. From 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of ten, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 each. Then from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 8's. So, same number of 4's and 8's in the units place. So, the count is equal here, so maybe the difference comes from the tens place or hundreds place.\n\nMoving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes through 0-9 ten times each. Wait, no, actually, from 1-99, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. But since we're starting from 1, the first set is 1-9, where the tens digit is 0. So, maybe it's better to think from 0-99, where each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. But since we're starting at 1, the first 9 numbers have 0 in the tens place, and then 10-19 have 1, etc. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, from 1-100: The tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each ten numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (40-49) and 8 appears 10 times (80-89). Similarly, from 101-200: The tens digit again cycles, so 4 appears 10 times (140-149) and 8 appears 10 times (180-189). Same for 201-300: 240-249 and 280-289. Then 301-400: 340-349 and 380-389. So, that's four hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds * 10 = 40 4's and 40 8's in the tens place from 1-400. Now, from 401-488: Let's see. The tens digits here go from 0 (401-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nFrom 401-409: The tens digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's here in the tens place.\n\nFrom 410-419: Tens digit is 1, so no.\n\n420-429: Tens digit is 2.\n\n430-439: Tens digit is 3.\n\n440-449: Tens digit is 4. So, here, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 440-449. So, that's 10 4's in the tens place.\n\n450-459: Tens digit is 5.\n\n460-469: Tens digit is 6.\n\n470-479: Tens digit is 7.\n\n480-488: Tens digit is 8. So, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, in 401-488, the tens digit contributes 10 4's and 9 8's.\n\nTherefore, total in the tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 = 50 4's, and 40 (from 1-400) + 9 = 49 8's.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's:50, 8's:49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n\nFor 4's: The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. But in the hundreds place, each number from 400-488 has a 4. So, that's 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nFor 8's: The hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:49 + 50 +89= 188\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.\n\nThe question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 - 98=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFirst, units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then from 481-488, units digits 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So, units:48+1=49 for both. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds, 10 each, so 40 each. Then from 401-488, the tens digits: 440-449 gives 10 4's, and 480-488 gives 9 8's. So, total tens place: 40+10=50 4's and 40+9=49 8's. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's. 8's in hundreds place: none, since 800 is beyond 488. So, 0.\n\nTotal 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, so the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400+1=89. So, each of those has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's. That seems right.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. And 8 in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, that adds 10 and 9 to the previous counts.\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8, and then 481-488 contributing one each. So, 49 each.\n\nWait, but when I think about the units place, from 1-480, that's 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of ten, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place:48+1=49 for both 4's and 8's.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\n8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488. By analyzing each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately, we find that the digit 4 appears 188 times and the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of ten numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - From 1 to 480: 48 sets \u00d7 1 = 48 each.\n   - From 481-488: One 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - From 1-400: 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 each.\n   - From 401-488:\n     - 440-449: 10 4's.\n     - 480-488: 9 8's.\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400-488: 89 numbers with 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - 8's: 0 occurrences.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Let me start by considering each position one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, every 10 numbers, the digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, same with 8. So, for each 10 pages, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Now, I need to figure out how many such blocks there are up to 488. Let me see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then 8 extra pages (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8). In each of the 48 blocks, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so that's 48 fours and 48 eights. Now, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, there's a 4 in 484 and an 8 in 488. That adds one more 4 and one more 8. So, total units place: 48+1=49 fours and 48+1=49 eights. So, units place contributes equally to both digits.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the 40-49 range, and similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the 80-89 range. Now, how many full hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). Let's check each hundred block:\n\n1-100: Tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 times. Tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, which is 10 times.\n101-200: Similarly, 140-149: 10 fours; 180-189: 10 eights.\n201-300: 240-249: 10 fours; 280-289: 10 eights.\n301-400: 340-349: 10 fours; 380-389: 10 eights.\n\nSo, in each of the four hundreds, we have 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 fours and 4*10=40 eights. Now, the last partial hundred is 401-488. Let's look at the tens digit here. The tens digit goes from 0 to 8 in 401-488. So, for the tens digit:\n\n- 40-49: Wait, no, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles as 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? Wait, no, 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Similarly, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. Wait, but 480 is part of 401-488, so yes, 480-488 is 9 pages where the tens digit is 8. So, in the tens place in 401-488, we have 10 fours (from 440-449) and 9 eights (from 480-488). So, adding that to the previous total: 40+10=50 fours and 40+9=49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, correct. The tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, yes, 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 50 fours and 49 eights.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 480-488 is 9 pages, but actually, 480 is included, so 480 to 488 is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. The hundreds digit 8 would appear in pages 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 89 fours and 0 eights.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages, so 89 fours. No hundreds digit 8 because the book ends at 488, so 800-899 isn't included. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. In the units place, we had 49 fours and 49 eights. In the tens place, 50 fours and 49 eights. In the hundreds place, 89 fours and 0 eights. So, adding up:\n\nFours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\nEights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference would be 188 fours minus 98 eights, which is 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- Each 10 pages, one 4 and one 8 in units.\n- 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48 fours and 48 eights.\n- Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8. So, 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So, 1 more 4 and 1 more 8. So, total units: 49 fours and 49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred block, 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n- 4 full hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10, so 40 fours and 40 eights.\n- Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 fours.\n- The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 eights because 488 is the end. So, adding 10 fours and 9 eights.\n- So, total tens place: 40+10=50 fours, 40+9=49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- Hundreds digit 4 occurs in 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, 89 fours.\n- Hundreds digit 8 doesn't occur because the book ends at 488. So, 0 eights.\n\nAdding up:\n- Fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98.\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought in the hundreds place, the 4's are 89, which is a lot. Let me check that again. From page 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so yes, 89 fours. That seems right.\n\nWait, another way to calculate the hundreds digit: The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400 to 488. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nNow, for the tens place in 401-488, I considered that the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages. And tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for tens digit 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For tens digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, yes, 9 eights there.\n\nSo, adding up, 49+50+89=188 fours, and 49+49+0=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this, maybe by using a formula or a different counting method, just to cross-verify.\n\nAnother approach could be to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position separately.\n\nFor units digit:\n- For each digit d (0-9), the number of times it appears in the units place up to N is floor((N)/10) + (1 if the last digit is >= d else 0). Wait, but maybe more accurately, it's (N // 10) + (1 if N % 10 >= d else 0), but adjusted for d=0.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to use the formula: For units digit, the count of digit d from 1 to N is (N // 10) * 1 + min(max(N % 10 - d + 1, 0), 1). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, for units digit, as we did before, every 10 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears once. So, up to 488, the number of complete 10s is 48, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8. So, for d=4, it's present once, and for d=8, once. So, total units digits: 48+1=49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nSimilarly, for tens digit, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, up to 488, we have 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), we need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, for tens digit 4, it's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For tens digit 8, it's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, adding to the previous 40, we get 40+10=50 fours and 40+9=49 eights.\n\nFor hundreds digit, as before, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up, same result: 188 fours and 98 eights, difference of 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Up to 488 pages, there are 48 full decades (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n   - 4's: 48 (from decades) + 1 (484) = 49.\n   - 8's: 48 (from decades) + 1 (488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Up to 488 pages, there are 4 full centuries (400 pages) and 88 extra pages (401-488).\n   - 4's: 4*10 (from centuries) + 10 (440-449) = 50.\n   - 8's: 4*10 (from centuries) + 9 (480-488) = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Digit 4 appears in pages 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n   - Digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place up to 488.\n   - 4's: 89.\n   - 8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can count the occurrences of 4 and 8 separately and then subtract the counts to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds, since page numbers can have up to three digits.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so I need to make sure I don't go beyond that. Let me think: from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). Each complete set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 fours. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so no 4 there. So, total 4's in the units place: 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, every 100 numbers, the digit in the tens place cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for every 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Now, let's see how many hundreds we have. The book goes up to 488, so we have 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, that's five sets of hundreds. Wait, no, 400-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but since we stop at 488, I need to adjust for that.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to consider each hundred block separately.\n\nFrom 1-99: The tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours.\n\nFrom 100-199: Similarly, the tens digit is 4 in 140-149, another 10 fours.\n\nFrom 200-299: The tens digit is 4 in 240-249, another 10 fours.\n\nFrom 300-399: The tens digit is 4 in 340-349, another 10 fours.\n\nFrom 400-488: The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 fours, but since we're stopping at 488, does this affect it? Wait, 440-449 is entirely within 400-488, so yes, that's 10 fours.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's 10 fours. So, adding up: 10 (1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but does 400-488 include 440-449? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 48+50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 fours in total.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Units place: 48 fours, tens place: 50 fours, hundreds place: 89 fours. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Again, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9, so 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total units place eights: 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, but wait, when we have 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once, so yes, total units eights: 48 +1=49.\n\nNow, the tens place: For the tens digit, every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, 8 appears 10 times in each hundred block's tens place.\n\nFrom 1-99: 80-89, which is 10 eights.\n\nFrom 100-199: 180-189, another 10 eights.\n\nFrom 200-299: 280-289, another 10 eights.\n\nFrom 300-399: 380-389, another 10 eights.\n\nFrom 400-488: The tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, because 488 is the last page. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, adding up: 10 (1-99) +10 (100-199)+10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+9 (400-488) = 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so yes, 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier for units place, I had 48 complete sets of 10, which gives 48 eights, and then in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit is 8 once, so 48+1=49. That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, each hundred block except the last one contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9 eights because it stops at 488. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That adds up.\n\nSo, total 4's:187, total 8's:98.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 187 - 98 = 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers, so that's 89 fours. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place, in each hundred block, 10 fours, and there are five hundred blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 fours. So, yes, 5 blocks each contributing 10 fours: 5*10=50.\n\nUnits place: 48 fours, as each 10 numbers contribute one 4, and the last 8 numbers don't add any more 4's.\n\nSo, 48+50+89=187.\n\nFor 8's, units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0, so 98.\n\nThus, 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the units place for 8's. Let me double-check.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, the number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, yes, 49 eights in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, 80-89, 180-189,...,480-488. Each hundred block contributes 10 eights except the last one, which contributes 9 eights because it stops at 488. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again. When I count the tens place for 8's, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, the tens place contributes 9 eights in the last block.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, there are no 8's because the book ends at 488, which is less than 800. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 89 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me try another approach to verify.\n\nAnother way to count the number of times a digit appears is to consider each digit position separately and calculate how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor a three-digit number, each digit can be in the hundreds, tens, or units place.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's:\n\n1. Units place:\n   - From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place?\n   - It's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484.\n   - The last such number is 484, which is 48*10 +4.\n   - So, the count is 48 +1 (since 484 is included) =49? Wait, no, wait: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours. Then, in the last partial cycle (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once at 484. So, total units place 4's:48+1=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's recalculate.\n\nWait, 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once at 484. So, total units place 4's:48+1=49.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 48, but now I'm getting 49. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's list some numbers:\n\nFrom 1-10: 4 appears once.\n\nFrom 11-20: 14 appears once.\n\n...\n\nFrom 481-490: 484 appears once.\n\nWait, but our book ends at 488, so 484 is included, but 490 is beyond. So, in the last partial ten (481-488), 484 is included, so that's one more 4.\n\nTherefore, units place 4's:48+1=49.\n\nWait, so I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 48. So, units place 4's:49.\n\nSimilarly, tens place 4's:\n\nIn each hundred block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n\nFrom 1-99: 40-49:10 fours.\n\nFrom 100-199:140-149:10 fours.\n\nFrom 200-299:240-249:10 fours.\n\nFrom 300-399:340-349:10 fours.\n\nFrom 400-488:440-449:10 fours.\n\nSo, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours:5*10=50 fours in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place 4's:\n\nFrom 400-488: all numbers have 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers? 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 fours.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier count of 187. Hmm, so where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, earlier I thought units place 4's were 48, but now I'm seeing it's 49. So, let me recast:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:50\n\nHundreds place:89\n\nTotal:49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place was 48, leading to 187. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIt's the number of times 4 is in the units digit. So, starting at 4, every 10 numbers:4,14,24,...,484.\n\nNow, 484 is 48*10 +4, so that's the 49th occurrence, because 4 is the first, then 14 is the second, etc., up to 484 being the 49th.\n\nSo, yes, units place 4's:49.\n\nSimilarly, tens place: as above, 50.\n\nHundreds place:89.\n\nSo, total 4's:188.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 187, but that was because I thought units place was 48. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial count.\n\nWait, let me check with a smaller example to see which approach is correct.\n\nSuppose we have a 14-page book. How many 4's in the units place?\n\nNumbers:4,14. So, two 4's. So, 14/10=1.4, so 1 full set, contributing one 4, and in the last partial set (11-14), 14 has a 4. So, total 1+1=2. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, in a 24-page book, units place 4's:2 (4,14,24). Wait, 24/10=2.4, so 2 full sets, each contributing one 4, and in the last partial set (21-24), 24 has a 4. So, total 2+1=3. Correct.\n\nSo, applying this to 488:488/10=48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, and in the last partial set (481-488), 484 has a 4. So, total units place 4's:48+1=49.\n\nTherefore, my initial count was wrong; it's 49, not 48. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, let's recount the 8's.\n\nUnits place 8's: From 1-488, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, 488/10=48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, and in the last partial set (481-488), 488 has an 8. So, total units place 8's:48+1=49.\n\nTens place 8's: In each hundred block, 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n\nFrom 1-99:80-89:10 eights.\n\nFrom 100-199:180-189:10 eights.\n\nFrom 200-299:280-289:10 eights.\n\nFrom 300-399:380-389:10 eights.\n\nFrom 400-488:480-488:9 eights (since 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers).\n\nSo, total tens place 8's:10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nHundreds place 8's: None, since the book ends at 488, which is less than 800. So, 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nTherefore, total 4's:188, total 8's:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so now I'm getting a difference of 90, but earlier I thought it was 89. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial count.\n\nWait, let me check again.\n\nUnits place 4's:49\n\nTens place 4's:50\n\nHundreds place 4's:89\n\nTotal 4's:49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nUnits place 8's:49\n\nTens place 8's:49\n\nHundreds place 8's:0\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so now I'm getting 90 as the difference, but earlier I thought it was 89. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check that.\n\nFrom 400-488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, all of them, since 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units)+50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89, but that was because I had an incorrect count of units place 4's as 48 instead of 49. So, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, let me confirm with another approach.\n\nAnother way to calculate the number of times a digit appears is to use the formula for each digit position.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears from 1 to N is:\n\nunits = (N // 10) + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nWait, but this is for digits 0-9. Wait, actually, for units place, it's a bit more involved because we have to consider whether the higher digits affect it.\n\nWait, perhaps a better formula is:\n\nFor each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times digit d appears.\n\nThe formula is a bit complex, but let's try to apply it.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of 4's.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nThe number of 4's in the units place can be calculated as:\n\nnumber_of_4s_units = (488 // 10) + (1 if (488 % 10) >=4 else 0)\n\n488 //10 =48\n\n488%10=8, which is >=4, so add 1.\n\nThus, number_of_4s_units=48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\nnumber_of_4s_tens = (488 // 100) *10 + min(max(488 % 100 -4*10 +1,0),10)\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nThe formula for the tens place is:\n\nhigher = N // 100\n\ncurrent = (N // 10) % 10\n\nlower = N % 10\n\nif current > d: count += (higher +1)*10\n\nelif current == d: count += (higher +1)*10 + (lower +1)\n\nelse: count += higher*10\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, for the tens place, each 100 numbers contribute 10 fours in the tens digit.\n\nSo, from 1-488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 (since 4*100=400), but wait, 488 is more than 400, so higher=4.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to use the formula:\n\nFor tens place:\n\ncount = (higher + (1 if current >4 else 0)) *10 + (lower +1 if current ==4 else 0)\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to stick to the initial counting method.\n\nBut given that I've already counted 50 fours in the tens place by considering each hundred block, I think that's accurate.\n\nSimilarly, for the hundreds place, it's straightforward: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:49\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal 8's:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think I made a mistake earlier by miscounting the units place 4's as 48 instead of 49. Once I corrected that, the total 4's became 188, leading to a difference of 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Every 10 numbers contribute one '4' in the units place.\n     - From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 '4's.\n     - The last partial set (481-488) includes 484, adding one more '4'.\n     - **Total in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - In each hundred block (e.g., 1-99, 100-199), the tens digit '4' appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49).\n     - There are five hundred blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n     - Each block contributes 10 '4's except the last, which contributes 10 from 440-449.\n     - **Total in tens place:** 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is '4' for all 89 numbers.\n     - **Total in hundreds place:** 89.\n\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Every 10 numbers contribute one '8' in the units place.\n     - From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 '8's.\n     - The last partial set (481-488) includes 488, adding one more '8'.\n     - **Total in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - In each hundred block, the tens digit '8' appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89).\n     - There are four complete hundred blocks contributing 10 '8's each, totaling 40.\n     - The last partial block (400-488) contributes 9 '8's from 480-488.\n     - **Total in tens place:** 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - No page numbers reach 800, so no '8's in the hundreds place.\n     - **Total in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should separate the counts for each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by considering each digit place one by one.\n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and an extra 8 pages. In each of those 48 blocks, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So that's 48 times each. Now, the extra 8 pages (from 481 to 488) will have 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Wait, no, the units digits in this last partial block would be 1 to 8. So, in the units place, does 4 appear in this last partial block? Let me see: 484 is within this range, so yes, 4 appears once in the units place. So, total units place 4's would be 48 (from the complete blocks) plus 1 (from the partial block), totaling 49. For 8's in the units place, in the complete blocks, it's 48, and in the partial block, 488 is included, so 8 appears once in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 as well. Wait, that can't be right because I thought 488 is the last page, so 488 is page 488, so the units digit 8 appears in 488, so that's one more. But wait, in the partial block from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 8 appears once in the units place (488), and 4 appears once (484). So, units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me move on to the tens place.\n\nFor the tens place, each digit appears 10 times in a block of 100. For example, in 0-99, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9, each appearing 10 times. So, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the same for 8 (80-89). Now, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401-488. In each of these 4 blocks, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40 for both 4 and 8. Now, the partial block from 401-488: the tens digit here ranges from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers if we count inclusively, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total tens place counts: 4's = 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8's in the hundreds place = 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences for each digit.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- Each block of 10 has one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1 to both 4 and 8.\n- Then, the last partial block is pages 481-488, which is 8 pages. The units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n- So, units place: 4's = 48 + 1 = 49, 8's = 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each block of 100 has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place.\n- There are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, etc.), so 4 * 10 = 40 for both.\n- The partial block is 401-488, which is 88 pages.\n- In the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times.\n- 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page. So, 4's: 40 + 10 = 50, 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n- 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place, so 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Units Place Analysis:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks (480 pages) and 8 additional pages (481-488).\n   - 4's: 48 (from blocks) + 1 (484) = 49.\n   - 8's: 48 (from blocks) + 1 (488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place Analysis:**\n   - Each block of 100 contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - 4 complete blocks (400 pages) contribute 40 each.\n   - Partial block (401-488): 4's appear 10 times (440-449), 8's appear 9 times (480-488).\n   - 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place Analysis:**\n   - 4's appear 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8's do not appear in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should separate the count based on the number of digits in the page numbers. Let me start by considering single-digit page numbers. For single-digit, the numbers are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits that appear are 1 through 9, each exactly once. So, how many 4's are there? Just one, which is the page number 4. Similarly, how many 8's? Also just one, page number 8. So, in single-digit pages, the count of 4's and 8's is equal, both being 1. Now moving on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should calculate the number of 4's and 8's in both the tens and units places separately. Let me start with the units place. For two-digit numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, for each ten's group (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit in the units place goes through 0-9. Therefore, in each ten's group, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 14, 24, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears once (like 18, 28, etc.). There are 9 ten's groups in two-digit numbers (10-99), so for the units place, the number of 4's is 9 and the number of 8's is also 9. Wait, no, that can't be right because from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers, which is 9 groups of 10. So, each digit from 0-9 appears 9 times in the units place for two-digit numbers. So, yes, 9 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place. Now, for the tens place in two-digit numbers. The tens digit is the same for a group of 10 numbers. For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers: 40-49. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 80-89. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. Therefore, in two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 9 (units) + 10 (tens) = 19. Similarly, the total number of 8's is 9 (units) + 10 (tens) = 19. So, in two-digit pages, both 4's and 8's appear 19 times each. So, up to page 99, the count of 4's is 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) = 20. Similarly, 8's are 1 + 19 = 20. So, up to page 99, both digits have appeared 20 times each. Now, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because now each page number has hundreds, tens, and units places. I think I need to break this down further. Let me consider the hundreds, tens, and units places separately for each digit. First, let's note that the hundreds digit in three-digit page numbers can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit ranges from 1 to 4. Let me handle each hundreds group separately: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. I'll need to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place for each group. Let me start with the hundreds place. For the hundreds digit, in 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's there. Similarly, in 200-299, it's 2; in 300-399, it's 3; and in 400-488, it's 4. So, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the hundreds digit only goes up to 4 in this book. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. Now, moving on to the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be from 0 to 9, and for each group of 100 numbers, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. But since we have different hundreds groups, I need to calculate this for each group. Let's break it down:\n\n1. For 100-199: The tens digit cycles from 0-9 ten times (100-109, 110-119, ..., 190-199). So, in each ten's group, each digit 0-9 appears once in the tens place. Therefore, in 100-199, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 140-149), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 180-189).\n\n2. Similarly, for 200-299: The tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times, so 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\n3. For 300-399: Same logic, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\n4. For 400-488: Now, this is a partial hundred. The tens digit cycles from 0-8, because 488 is the last page. So, let's see: from 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Each tens digit appears 10 times except for the last one, which is 8, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit 8 only appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, no, actually, in 400-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. Let me check:\n\n- 400-409: tens digit 0\n- 410-419: tens digit 1\n- 420-429: tens digit 2\n- 430-439: tens digit 3\n- 440-449: tens digit 4\n- 450-459: tens digit 5\n- 460-469: tens digit 6\n- 470-479: tens digit 7\n- 480-488: tens digit 8\n\nSo, each tens digit from 0-8 appears 10 times except for 8, which appears only 9 times because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place for 400-488:\n\n- Digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449)\n- Digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488)\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. The tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the digit 8 in the tens place appears 9 times here. But the digit 4 in the tens place is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in the tens place for 400-488:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times\n- 8 appears 9 times\n\nTherefore, for the tens place across all three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-199: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times\n- 200-299: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times\n- 300-399: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times\n- 400-488: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times\n\nSo, total in tens place:\n\n- 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40\n- 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For 100-199, 200-299, and 300-399, each has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. For 400-488, 4's in tens place: 10 (440-449), 8's: 9 (480-488). So, total tens place:\n\n- 4's: 10*3 + 10 = 40\n- 8's: 10*3 + 9 = 39\n\nSo, 40 4's and 39 8's in the tens place across all three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Similar to the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in the units place for each group of 10 numbers. Let's break it down by hundreds groups.\n\n1. For 100-199: Each units digit from 0-9 appears 10 times. So, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\n2. Similarly, for 200-299: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n3. For 300-399: Same, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n4. For 400-488: Now, this is a bit tricky because it's a partial hundred. Let's see, from 400-488, how many times does each digit appear in the units place?\n\nEach tens group (like 400-409, 410-419, etc.) has 10 numbers except for the last one, which is 480-488, which has 9 numbers. So, for each tens group except the last, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. For the last tens group (480-488), digits 0-8 appear once, but 9 doesn't because 489 isn't included.\n\nSo, in 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, in each tens group, 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 tens groups (0-8), but the last group only has 9 numbers, so does that affect the count? Wait, no. Each tens group from 400-409 up to 470-479 has 10 numbers, so in each of those, 4 appears once in the units place. The last tens group is 480-488, which has 9 numbers, so 4 appears once in the units place (484). So, total 4's in units place for 400-488: 9 tens groups (0-8), each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 9 times. Similarly, 8's in the units place: in each tens group, 8 appears once, except in the last tens group where it appears once as well (488). So, 9 tens groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me think again. For 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens group. So, in 400-409, units digits are 0-9, so 4 and 8 each appear once. Similarly, in 410-419, same thing, and so on up to 470-479. Then, in 480-488, units digits are 0-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once (484 and 488). So, for each of the first 8 tens groups (400-409 to 470-479), each contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then, the last tens group (480-488) contributes one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, total units place for 400-488:\n\n- 4's: 9 (from 400-488)\n- 8's: 9 (from 400-488)\n\nWait, but actually, each of the first 8 tens groups (400-409 to 470-479) contributes one 4 and one 8, so that's 8 each, and then the last group (480-488) contributes one 4 and one 8, so total 9 each. So, yes, 9 4's and 9 8's in the units place for 400-488.\n\nTherefore, for the units place across all three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-199: 10 4's, 10 8's\n- 200-299: 10 4's, 10 8's\n- 300-399: 10 4's, 10 8's\n- 400-488: 9 4's, 9 8's\n\nSo, total units place:\n\n- 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n- 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Because in each of the first three hundreds groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the units place for 4 and 8 each appear 10 times. Then, in 400-488, units place for 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times. So, total units place:\n\n- 4's: 10*3 + 9 = 39\n- 8's: 10*3 + 9 = 39\n\nSo, 39 each.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4's: 89\n  - 8's: 0\n- Tens place:\n  - 4's: 40\n  - 8's: 39\n- Units place:\n  - 4's: 39\n  - 8's: 39\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n- 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nWait, let me check that addition again.\n\nHundreds place: 89 4's, 0 8's.\n\nTens place: 40 4's, 39 8's.\n\nUnits place: 39 4's, 39 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nTotal 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nHmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's add up the counts from all page numbers:\n\n- Single-digit (1-9):\n  - 4's: 1\n  - 8's: 1\n- Two-digit (10-99):\n  - 4's: 19\n  - 8's: 19\n- Three-digit (100-488):\n  - 4's: 168\n  - 8's: 78\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that addition again.\n\nSingle-digit: 1 each.\n\nTwo-digit: 19 each.\n\nThree-digit: 168 for 4's, 78 for 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 = 20, plus 168 is 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 = 20, plus 78 is 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nFirst, let's verify the counts for three-digit numbers.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- Only 400-488 has 4 in the hundreds place, and there are 89 numbers there, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- 100-199: 10 4's, 10 8's\n- 200-299: 10 4's, 10 8's\n- 300-399: 10 4's, 10 8's\n- 400-488: 10 4's, 9 8's\nTotal tens place:\n- 4's: 10*3 + 10 = 40\n- 8's: 10*3 + 9 = 39\nYes, that's correct.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 100-199: 10 4's, 10 8's\n- 200-299: 10 4's, 10 8's\n- 300-399: 10 4's, 10 8's\n- 400-488: 9 4's, 9 8's\nTotal units place:\n- 4's: 10*3 + 9 = 39\n- 8's: 10*3 + 9 = 39\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, three-digit numbers contribute 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 4's and 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 8's.\n\nAdding single and two-digit:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 each.\n\nTwo-digit: 19 each.\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nBut let me think again. Is there a possibility that I overcounted somewhere? For example, in the three-digit numbers, when I considered the hundreds place, I only counted 4's, which is correct because 8 never appears in the hundreds place. In the tens place, I correctly accounted for each group, and in the units place as well.\n\nAnother way to think about it: maybe I can calculate the total number of 4's and 8's in each digit place across all page numbers.\n\nLet me try that approach to cross-verify.\n\nFirst, let's consider all page numbers from 1 to 488. Each page number can be considered as a three-digit number by adding leading zeros, so 1 becomes 001, 10 becomes 010, etc. This might make it easier to calculate digit occurrences in each place.\n\nBut wait, leading zeros aren't actually printed, so maybe this approach isn't accurate. However, for the sake of calculation, let's consider each number as three digits, and then adjust for the fact that leading zeros aren't counted.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to separate the counts as I did before.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers.\n\nLet's try that.\n\n1. Units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the units place? Well, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in the units place, except possibly the last partial group.\n\nTotal numbers: 488.\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: 48 (since 48*10=480), with 8 remaining numbers (481-488).\n\nIn each complete group of 10, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, for 48 complete groups, each digit appears 48 times.\n\nThen, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so digits 1-8 each appear once, and 9 and 0 don't appear.\n\nSo, total units place:\n\n- For digits 0-9:\n\n  - 0: 48 times (from 10,20,...,480)\n  - 1-8: 48 + 1 = 49 times each\n  - 9: 48 times (from 9,19,...,479)\n\nWait, but 488 is the last number, so units digits go up to 8 in the last partial group. So, for digit 9, it only appears up to 479, which is 48 times. So, for units place:\n\n- 4 appears 49 times\n- 8 appears 49 times\n\nSimilarly, 0 appears 48 times, and 9 appears 48 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-480, there are 48 groups of 10, so 48 times. Then, in 481-488, 4 appears once as 484. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears once every 10 numbers, so 48 times from 1-480, and once in 488, totaling 49 times.\n\nSo, units place: 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\n2. Tens place:\n\nNow, for the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, in 1-488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, ..., 401-500), but wait, 488 is less than 500, so actually, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488.\n\nWait, no, actually, 1-100 is the first hundred, 101-200 the second, 201-300 the third, 301-400 the fourth, and 401-488 is the fifth partial hundred.\n\nBut let's think in terms of how many times each digit appears in the tens place.\n\nIn each hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), but wait, actually, in 1-100, the tens digit for 1-9 is 0, and from 10-99, it's 1-9, and 100 has 0. So, in 1-100, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nFrom 1-9: tens digit is 0, so 0 appears 9 times.\n\nFrom 10-99: tens digit cycles 1-9, each appearing 10 times.\n\nFrom 100: tens digit is 0.\n\nSo, in 1-100, tens digit counts:\n\n- 0: 10 (from 1-9 and 100)\n- 1-9: 10 each (from 10-99)\n\nWait, no. From 1-9, tens digit is 0, so 0 appears 9 times. Then, from 10-99, tens digits 1-9 each appear 10 times. Then, 100 has tens digit 0. So, total tens digits in 1-100:\n\n- 0: 9 (from 1-9) + 1 (from 100) = 10\n- 1-9: 10 each\n\nSo, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place from 1-100.\n\nSimilarly, in 101-200, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times, so each digit 0-9 appears 10 times.\n\nSame for 201-300 and 301-400.\n\nNow, for 401-488: the tens digit cycles from 0-8, because 488 is the last number. So, let's see:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: tens digit 1\n- ...\n- 481-488: tens digit 8\n\nSo, each tens digit from 0-8 appears 10 times except for 8, which appears 8 times (since 481-488 is 8 numbers). Wait, no. Let's count:\n\n- 401-410: 10 numbers, tens digit 0\n- 411-420: 10 numbers, tens digit 1\n- 421-430: 10 numbers, tens digit 2\n- 431-440: 10 numbers, tens digit 3\n- 441-450: 10 numbers, tens digit 4\n- 451-460: 10 numbers, tens digit 5\n- 461-470: 10 numbers, tens digit 6\n- 471-480: 10 numbers, tens digit 7\n- 481-488: 8 numbers, tens digit 8\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 481-488 is 8 numbers, so tens digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nWait, but 481-488 is 8 numbers: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, 8 numbers, so tens digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, in 401-488, the tens digits are:\n\n- 0: 10\n- 1: 10\n- 2: 10\n- 3: 10\n- 4: 10\n- 5: 10\n- 6: 10\n- 7: 10\n- 8: 8\n\nSo, in the tens place for 401-488, digit 8 appears 8 times, and the others 0-7 appear 10 times, and 9 doesn't appear.\n\nTherefore, total tens place counts:\n\n- From 1-400: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times for each digit 0-9 in the tens place. So, 4*10 = 40 times each for digits 0-9.\n\n- From 401-488: as above.\n\nSo, total tens place counts:\n\n- For digits 0-7: 40 + 10 = 50 each\n- For digit 8: 40 + 8 = 48\n- For digit 9: 40 + 0 = 40\n\nWait, but this seems conflicting with my earlier approach. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, no, because from 1-400, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place (4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times). Then, from 401-488, digit 8 appears 8 times, and digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, and 9 doesn't appear.\n\nSo, total tens place counts:\n\n- 0: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 1: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 2: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 3: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 4: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 5: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 6: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 7: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8: 40 + 8 = 48\n- 9: 40 + 0 = 40\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 48 times.\n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated for three-digit numbers, I had 40 4's and 39 8's in the tens place. Hmm, there seems to be a discrepancy here. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach. Let me reconcile these two methods.\n\nIn the first approach, when considering three-digit numbers, I broke them down into 100-199, 200-299, etc., and calculated the tens and units places separately. Now, using this second method, considering the entire range up to 488, I'm getting different counts.\n\nWait, perhaps the second method is more accurate because it's considering the entire range without breaking it into hundreds.\n\nSo, according to the second method:\n\n- Units place:\n  - 4 appears 49 times\n  - 8 appears 49 times\n\n- Tens place:\n  - 4 appears 50 times\n  - 8 appears 48 times\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times\n  - 8 appears 0 times\n\nSo, total counts:\n\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nWait, but earlier I had 98 for 8's. Hmm, so which is correct?\n\nWait, in the second method, units place: 49 each, tens place: 50 for 4, 48 for 8, hundreds place: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nBut earlier, in the first approach, I had 188 4's and 98 8's, giving a difference of 90. Now, in the second approach, I'm getting 188 4's and 97 8's, difference of 91.\n\nWait, this inconsistency suggests that I made a mistake somewhere. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the first approach, when calculating three-digit numbers, I considered:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 4's, 0 8's\n- Tens place: 40 4's, 39 8's\n- Units place: 39 4's, 39 8's\n\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 4's in three-digit numbers, and 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 8's.\n\nThen, adding single and two-digit:\n\n- Single-digit: 1 each\n- Two-digit: 19 each\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nBut in the second approach, using the entire range:\n\n- Units place: 49 each\n- Tens place: 50 for 4, 48 for 8\n- Hundreds place: 89 for 4, 0 for 8\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nSo, there's a discrepancy of 1 in the count of 8's. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's think about the tens place in the second approach. From 1-488, the tens digit for 8 appears 48 times. But in the first approach, when considering three-digit numbers, I had 39 8's in the tens place. But in the second approach, it's 48. So, perhaps the second approach is correct, and the first approach had an error.\n\nWait, in the first approach, when I considered three-digit numbers, I broke down the tens place as:\n\n- 100-199: 10 8's\n- 200-299: 10 8's\n- 300-399: 10 8's\n- 400-488: 9 8's\n\nTotal: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\nBut in the second approach, it's 48. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps in the first approach, I didn't account for the fact that in single and two-digit numbers, the tens place also includes 8's. Wait, no, because in the first approach, I separated single-digit (1-9), two-digit (10-99), and three-digit (100-488). So, in the first approach, the tens place for two-digit numbers would include 8's as well.\n\nWait, in the first approach, when I calculated two-digit numbers, I considered the tens place as 10 8's (from 80-89), but in reality, from 10-99, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. Similarly, in the units place, 8 appears 9 times in two-digit numbers (18,28,...,98), which is 9 times.\n\nWait, but in the second approach, considering the entire range, the tens place for 8 appears 48 times. So, perhaps the"

    "text": " Maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract the two counts to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nFirst, the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in every block of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 pages. But wait, actually, 10 times 48 is 480, so pages 481 to 488 are the remaining 8 pages. So, in each block of 10, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48 blocks would give 48 fours. But wait, pages 481-488: the units digits go from 1 to 8, so in this last partial block, there's no 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, specifically from 40 to 49. So, in each hundred, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, the hundreds places go from 1 to 4. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each hundred, there's a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, for 4 hundreds, that would be 4 times 10, which is 40 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but hold on. The last hundred is 400-488, right? So, from 400 to 488, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, but wait, 400-409 would have tens digit 0, and then 410-419 would have tens digit 1, etc. Wait no, actually, 400-409 would have tens digit 0, 410-419 tens digit 1, up to 440-449 tens digit 4, and then 450-459 tens digit 5, and so on. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 fours in the tens place for the 400-488 block. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so for 4 hundreds, that's 4 times 10, which is 40. But wait, actually, the first hundred (1-100) includes 40-49, which is 10 fours in the tens place. The second hundred (101-200) includes 140-149, which is another 10 fours. Similarly, the third hundred (201-300) includes 240-249, another 10 fours. The fourth hundred (301-400) includes 340-349, another 10 fours. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is another 10 fours. Wait, but 400-488 is actually part of the fourth hundred, right? So, maybe I'm double-counting? Wait, no, because 400-488 is the fourth hundred, but the tens digit 4 in 400-488 is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in total, for each hundred, we have 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 hundreds would give 40 fours in the tens place. So, that seems correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for page numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 40 = 88, plus 89 is 177. Wait, 48 + 40 is 88, plus 89 is 177. So, 177 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in every block of 10 numbers, the units digit 8 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many full blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 eights. Then, in the last partial block, pages 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so page 488 has a units digit of 8. So, that's one more 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 8 appears in blocks of 100. Specifically, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers. So, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, for each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, in the first hundred (1-100), that's 10 eights in the tens place. Similarly, in the second hundred (101-200), it's 180-189, another 10 eights. Third hundred (201-300), 280-289, another 10. Fourth hundred (301-400), 380-389, another 10. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 would be in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds, and 9 times in the fourth hundred. So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. For the first hundred (1-100), 80-89: 10 eights. Second hundred (101-200), 180-189: 10. Third hundred (201-300), 280-289: 10. Fourth hundred (301-400), 380-389: 10. Then, in 400-488, it's 480-488: 9 numbers. So, yes, 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9? Wait, no, wait. The fourth hundred is 301-400, so 380-389 is in that hundred. Then, 400-488 is part of the next hundred, but since 400-488 is only part of the fourth hundred, wait, no, actually, 400-488 is the fourth hundred, right? Because 400 is the start of the fourth hundred. So, in the fourth hundred, 301-400, the tens digit 8 is in 380-389, which is 10 eights. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in total, the tens digit 8 appears 10 (from 380-389) + 9 (from 480-488) = 19 eights in the tens place for the fourth hundred. Wait, no, that's not right because 380-389 is in the third hundred, right? Wait, no, 380-389 is in the third hundred (201-300), because 300 is the end of the third hundred. Wait, no, 301-400 is the fourth hundred, so 380-389 is within 301-400, which is the fourth hundred. So, in the fourth hundred, the tens digit 8 appears in 380-389, which is 10 numbers, and in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 10 + 9 = 19 eights in the tens place in the fourth hundred. But wait, the fourth hundred is only up to 400, right? So, 400 is the end of the fourth hundred, and 480-488 is beyond that, so maybe I'm mixing up the hundreds.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider each hundred separately:\n\n- 1-100: tens digit 8 in 80-89: 10 eights.\n- 101-200: tens digit 8 in 180-189: 10 eights.\n- 201-300: tens digit 8 in 280-289: 10 eights.\n- 301-400: tens digit 8 in 380-389: 10 eights.\n- 401-488: tens digit 8 in 480-488: 9 eights.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is part of the fourth hundred, which is 301-400? No, 401-488 is beyond 400, so actually, 401-488 is part of the next hundred, which would be the fifth hundred, but since we only go up to 488, it's part of the fourth hundred's continuation. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me just count each occurrence:\n\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9\n\nSo, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in page numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the units place. I had 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48, and then the last partial block, 481-488, has an 8 in the units place on page 488, so that's one more, making it 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, as I broke down, it's 10 in each hundred for the first four hundreds, but wait, no, in the fourth hundred, 301-400, the tens digit 8 is in 380-389, which is 10, and then in 401-488, it's 480-488, which is 9. So, that's 10 + 9 = 19 in the fourth hundred's tens place, but actually, 380-389 is in the third hundred (201-300), so maybe I'm mixing up. Wait, no, 301-400 is the fourth hundred, so 380-389 is within that. So, each hundred from 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400 each contribute 10 eights in the tens place, so that's 4 times 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, which is part of the fifth hundred, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 eights. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the hundreds place for 8's was zero, which is correct because the book doesn't go beyond 488, so no page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, for the 4's, I had 177, and for the 8's, 98. So, the difference is 177 - 98 = 79. So, there are 79 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to miscount.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 40\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 40 = 88 + 89 = 177.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 177 - 98 = 79.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 79 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 177, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 79 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{79}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start with the units place because that seems the simplest.\n\nFor the units place, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.) and the same goes for 8. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each complete block, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48, and the same for 8's. But wait, I also need to check the last partial block, which is 481-488. In the units place here, the numbers go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, adding that, units place contributes 49 4's and 49 8's? Wait, no, that can't be right because the partial block only adds one more 4 and one more 8. Wait, let me think again. The complete blocks are 48, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8. Then the partial block from 481-488 has 8 numbers, so units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 8's. So, in the units place, they're equal. Hmm, so maybe the difference comes from the tens place or the hundreds place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, a digit repeats every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (40-49), and the same for 8 (80-89). So, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial hundred (401-488). In each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 4's and 40 8's in the tens place. Now, the partial hundred is 401-488. Let's look at the tens place here. The numbers go from 401 to 488, so the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? It's only in 440-449, which is 10 times. Similarly, how about 8? It's in 480-488, but wait, 488 is the end. So, 480-488 has 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), but wait, 480-488 is actually 9 numbers because 480 is the first and 488 is the last. Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (including both), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, in the tens place for the partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, adding that to the previous 40, we get 40 + 10 = 50 4's and 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. So, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 49, so 4's are one more here.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (400-488 inclusive). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. How about 8? Well, in the hundreds place, 8 would be from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8's in the hundreds place are zero. So, in the hundreds place, 4's are 89 and 8's are 0.\n\nNow, let me add up all the 4's and 8's across all digit places.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- Complete blocks: 48, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8. So, 48 each.\n- Partial block 481-488: units digits 1-8, so 4 once and 8 once. So, units place total: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nTens place:\n- Complete hundreds (4 of them): 10 each, so 40 each.\n- Partial hundred (401-488): tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. Tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but wait, 480 to 488 is actually 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n- 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks (480 numbers) and a partial block (8 numbers: 481-488).\n   - 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 complete blocks (400 numbers) and a partial block (88 numbers: 401-488).\n   - Complete blocks: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - Partial block: 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4's: 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8's: 0 times.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by thinking about each place one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers. In each complete block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the digit 8 appears once (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). So for 48 complete blocks, that would be 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, does 4 appear? Yes, at 484. And 8 appears at 488. So, that's one more 4 and one more 8. So, total units place: 48 +1 =49 fours and 48 +1=49 eights. Hmm, so in the units place, they are equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each block of 100. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 ten times (40-49) and 8 ten times (80-89). So, in each 100-number block, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place. Now, how many complete 100-number blocks are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an extra 88 numbers (401-488). In each of the 4 complete blocks, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40 for each. Now, in the extra 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. From 401-409, the tens digit is 0. From 410-419, it's 1. 420-429: 2. 430-439: 3. 440-449:4. 450-459:5. 460-469:6. 470-479:7. 480-488:8. So, in the tens place, in 401-488, 4 appears once in the tens place (440-449) which is 10 times, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. Similarly, 480-488 has the tens digit as 8, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 488 is included, so that's 9 numbers. Wait, no, 480 is the start, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the extra 88 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 40 (from complete blocks) +10=50 fours, and 40 +9=49 eights. So, fours have 50 and eights have 49 in the tens place.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, let's see. From 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1. 200-299:2. 300-399:3. 400-488:4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. How about 8? Well, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, which is in the 400s. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, in the hundreds place, fours have 89 and eights have 0.\n\nNow, let's add up the totals for each digit place.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal fours: 49 +50 +89=188\n\nFor eights:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal eights:49+49+0=98\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then the last 8 numbers, 481-488, units digits 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 once (488). So, units: 48+1=49 each. That seems right.\n\nTens place: 4 complete hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, in the tens place, 4 appears once in 440-449 (10 times) and 8 appears in 480-488 (9 times). So, 40+10=50 fours, 40+9=49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times. 8 never appears in hundreds place. So, 89 fours, 0 eights. Correct.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188. Eights:49+49+0=98. Difference:188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just think if I missed anything. Maybe I should check the counts again.\n\nWait, in the units place, from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear? Each 10 numbers, once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So, 48+1=49 fours in units place. Similarly, 8 appears once in units place in each 10, so 48 times, plus once in 488, so 49. Correct.\n\nIn tens place, each hundred has 10 fours and 10 eights. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) give 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, 440-449: tens digit 4, which is 10 numbers. 480-488: tens digit 8, which is 9 numbers. So, 10 fours and 9 eights. So, total tens:40+10=50 fours, 40+9=49 eights. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. No eights. So, 89 fours. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Eights:49+49+0=98. Difference:90.\n\nI think that's accurate. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 and one 8.\n   - Remaining 8 numbers (481-488): 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total: 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.88 \u2192 4 complete blocks, each contributing 10 fours and 10 eights.\n   - Remaining 88 numbers (401-488): 4 appears 10 times (440-449), 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 fours, 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- Fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- Eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n188 fours - 98 eights = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

For each position, I can figure out how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's.\n\n1. Units place:\n   - In the units place, 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many full groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups, each contributing one 4. That's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is another 4. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place:\n   - In the tens place, 4 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4*10 = 40. Then, in the next hundred, which is 401-488, the tens place goes from 0 to 8. So, 401-410 has 4 in the tens place for 10 numbers, but wait, 401-410 is actually 10 numbers where the tens digit is 0, then 411-420 is 1, and so on. Wait, no, actually, in the 400s, the tens digit is 0 in 401-410, 1 in 411-420, up to 8 in 481-490. But since our book ends at 488, the tens digit in 481-488 is 8, so the 4 in the tens place in the 400s would only be from 440-449. So, that's another 10 numbers, so 10 more 4's. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n   - In the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\n1. Units place:\n   - Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, that's 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. The last partial group is 481-488, where the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included, which adds another 8. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place:\n   - In the tens place, 8 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many full hundreds? 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 400s, the tens digit can be 8 from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n   - In the hundreds place, 8 would appear from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nNow, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when counting, especially in the tens and hundreds places, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nFor the 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus 484, so 49. That seems right.\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's, so 40, plus in the 400s, 440-449, which is 10 more, so 50. That adds up.\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. So, total 49+50+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 full tens, each one 8, so 48, plus 488, so 49. Correct.\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds, each 10 8's, so 40, plus in the 400s, 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 49. Correct.\n- Hundreds: No 8's. So, total 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the tens place for 4's, I counted 10 in the 400s, but the 400s go up to 488, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. Similarly, for 8's, in the 400s, 480-488 is correct.\n\nAnother way to check is to consider that in each position, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated using a formula. For example, for units and tens places, the count is (n // 10) * 10^(k-1) + extra, where k is the position. Maybe I can use that formula to cross-verify.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about each digit position separately and use a more systematic approach.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFor the units place:\n\n- For 4's: The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is 48, plus any additional if the last partial group has a 4. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, the last group ends at 8, which includes 484, so that's +1. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- For 8's: Similarly, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is 48 (from 1 to 480) plus 1 from 488, so 49.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\n- For 4's: The number of times 4 appears in the tens place is calculated by looking at how many full hundreds there are, which is 4, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 40 +10=50.\n\n- For 8's: Similarly, the number of times 8 appears in the tens place is 4*10=40 from the first four hundreds, plus in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, 40 +9=49.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\n- For 4's: The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, 89.\n\n- For 8's: The hundreds digit is 8 from 800-899, but since our book ends at 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Maybe I should count the occurrences of 4 and 8 separately in each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) and then compare the totals.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears once (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). So, to find out how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place, I can divide the total number of pages by 10 and see how many complete blocks there are, then multiply by 1 for each digit. But wait, 488 isn't a multiple of 10, so there might be an incomplete block at the end.\n\nLet me calculate the number of complete blocks. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. That gives 48 fours and 48 eights from the units place. Now, the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488) would be from 481 to 488. In the units place of these, how many 4's and 8's are there? Looking at 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. That's one more 4 and one more 8. So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 fours and 48 + 1 = 49 eights. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is included, so maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (each 10 pages) plus 8 more pages. So, in the units place, the number of 4's is 48 (from each block) plus 1 (from 484), totaling 49. Similarly, the number of 8's is 48 (from each block) plus 1 (from 488), totaling 49. So, units place: 49 fours and 49 eights.\n\nNext, the tens place. For the tens digit, the pattern repeats every 100 pages. Each block of 100 pages has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). Now, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. That gives 4*10=40 fours and 4*10=40 eights. Now, we have the remaining 88 pages (from 400 to 488). Let's look at the tens place in this range. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in the 400s. So, in 400-409, the tens digit is 0; 410-419 is 1; up to 480-488, which is 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's only in 440-449, which is 10 times. Similarly, how many times does 8 appear? It's in 480-488, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 pages (480-488 inclusive, but 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. So, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit contributes 10 fours and 9 eights. So, total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 fours and 40 + 9 = 49 eights.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. Each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) will have a hundreds digit of 1, 2, 3, or 4. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages, contributing 89 fours. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so zero eights there.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor eights:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal eights = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more fours are printed than eights. So, subtract the total eights from the total fours: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488), so total units: 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 fours and 10 eights, so 40 each. Then, the last partial hundred (400-488) has 10 fours (440-449) and 9 eights (480-488). So, total tens: 50 fours and 49 eights. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 fours. No eights in hundreds place. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Eights: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought, in the tens place for the last partial hundred, is the count correct? From 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for the tens digit being 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages. For the tens digit being 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother check: Let's count the number of fours and eights in each place again.\n\nUnits place:\n- 48 full decades: 48 fours, 48 eights.\n- Last 8 pages: 484 (4) and 488 (8). So, 1 four and 1 eight.\nTotal: 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\nTens place:\n- 4 full centuries: 4*10 = 40 fours, 4*10 = 40 eights.\n- Last 88 pages: tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (440-449), and tens digit 8 occurs 9 times (480-488).\nTotal: 40 +10=50 fours, 40 +9=49 eights.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n- No eights in hundreds place.\nTotal: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nAdding up:\nFours: 49 +50 +89 = 188\nEights:49 +49 +0 =98\nDifference:188 -98 =90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 48 full blocks (480 pages) give 48 fours and 48 eights.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total: 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 pages contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n   - 4 full centuries (400 pages) give 40 fours and 40 eights.\n   - The last 88 pages (400-488) add 10 fours (440-449) and 9 eights (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 fours, 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 fours (since the hundreds digit is 4 for all).\n   - No eights appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- Fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- Eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 fours - 98 eights = 90 more fours.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should count the number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract the two counts to find the difference. Let me start by counting the number of 4's.\n\nFirst, let's consider single-digit page numbers: 1 to 9. In this range, the only single-digit number that has a 4 is 4 itself. So, that's one 4. There are no 8's in this range because 8 is also a single-digit number, but since I'm counting 4's and 8's separately, I should note that there's one 4 and one 8 here. Wait, but I'm supposed to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, so maybe I should track both counts as I go through each range.\n\nNext, let's move on to two-digit page numbers: 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. Similarly, I'll do the same for 8.\n\nStarting with 4's in the tens place: The tens digit is 4, so the numbers are from 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nNow, for 4's in the units place: The units digit is 4, so in each set of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the number ending with 4 is 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but in the two-digit numbers, it's from 10 to 99, so that's 9 sets of ten (10-19 up to 90-99). But actually, from 10 to 99, there are 9 decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 9 times, but wait, 44 is included here. So, in the units place, how many 4's? Let me count: 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences of 4 in the units place.\n\nWait, but 44 has two 4's, right? So, I think I might have made a mistake here. Because when I count 44, I'm already counting one 4 in the tens place and another in the units place. So, when I count the tens place, I included 44 as part of the 40-49 range, and when I count the units place, I included 44 again. So, in total, for two-digit numbers, the number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. But wait, 44 is counted twice here, so actually, the total number of 4's in two-digit numbers is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19, but 44 contributes two 4's, so the total count is correct because each occurrence is counted separately.\n\nWait, no, that's correct because each digit is counted separately. So, the tens place has 10 4's (from 40-49), and the units place has 9 4's (from 14, 24, ..., 94). So, total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nSimilarly, let's count the number of 8's in two-digit numbers. First, 8's in the tens place: numbers from 80 to 89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, 8's in the units place: in each set of ten (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the number ending with 8 is 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences of 8 in the units place.\n\nAgain, 88 has two 8's, but when counting, we're counting each occurrence separately. So, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nWait, but in the units place, from 10-99, there are 9 decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, except that 88 is included in both the tens and units count. So, the total 8's in two-digit numbers are 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 10-99, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times. And 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 10 times in the tens place. So, total 19 8's in two-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but 88 is counted in both, so the total 8's in two-digit numbers are 10 + 9 = 19. So, both 4's and 8's have 19 occurrences in two-digit numbers.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because in the single-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear once each. So, up to two-digit numbers, 4's would be 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) = 20, and 8's would be 1 + 19 = 20. So, up to page 99, both 4's and 8's are equal. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in single-digit, 4 appears once, 8 appears once. In two-digit, 4 appears 19 times, 8 appears 19 times. So, total up to page 99, 4's: 20, 8's: 20. So, they're equal so far. But the book goes up to 488, so I need to consider three-digit page numbers as well.\n\nNow, let's move on to three-digit page numbers: 100 to 488. Each three-digit number has a hundreds place, tens place, and units place. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nLet me start by considering the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, numbers from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nFirst, let's count 4's in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences of 4.\n\nNow, let's count 8's in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, let's count 4's in the tens place for three-digit numbers. The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last range would be 440-449, and then 450-488. So, let's check each hundred.\n\nFor 100-199: tens digit is 4 in 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nFor 200-299: tens digit is 4 in 240-249. Another 10 numbers, 10 occurrences.\n\nFor 300-399: tens digit is 4 in 340-349. Another 10 numbers, 10 occurrences.\n\nFor 400-488: tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers, 10 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place in three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40.\n\nWait, but wait, in 400-488, the tens digit can be 4 only up to 449, right? Because 450-488 have tens digits from 5 to 8. So, 440-449 is indeed 10 numbers. So, 40 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's count 8's in the tens place for three-digit numbers. The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n\nWait, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, so let's check each hundred:\n\n100-199: tens digit 8 in 180-189. 10 numbers, 10 occurrences.\n\n200-299: tens digit 8 in 280-289. 10 numbers, 10 occurrences.\n\n300-399: tens digit 8 in 380-389. 10 numbers, 10 occurrences.\n\n400-488: tens digit 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier that 4's in the tens place were 40 and 8's were 39. So, that's interesting.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place for three-digit numbers. Let's count 4's first.\n\nIn each hundred, the units digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred, the number ending with 4 occurs 10 times (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194 in 100-199). But since our book goes up to 488, we need to check if the last hundred (400-488) has the same number of units digits ending with 4.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n100-199: units digit 4 occurs in 104, 114, 124, 134, 144, 154, 164, 174, 184, 194. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\n200-299: same pattern, 204, 214, ..., 294. 10 occurrences.\n\n300-399: 304, 314, ..., 394. 10 occurrences.\n\n400-488: Now, the units digit 4 occurs in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, but 484 is within 400-488, so that's 9 numbers. Wait, let me count: starting from 404, each 10 numbers, so 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 494 would be beyond 488, so we stop at 484. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 4's in the units place for three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but wait, in 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs at 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, right? Because 404 is the first, then every 10 numbers up to 484. So, 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, let's count 8's in the units place for three-digit numbers.\n\nAgain, for each hundred:\n\n100-199: units digit 8 occurs in 108, 118, 128, 138, 148, 158, 168, 178, 188, 198. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\n200-299: same pattern, 208, 218, ..., 298. 10 occurrences.\n\n300-399: 308, 318, ..., 398. 10 occurrences.\n\n400-488: units digit 8 occurs in 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so let's count: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers, right? Because 498 would be beyond 488, so we stop at 488. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's in the units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but let me check 400-488 for units digit 8. Starting at 408, then 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers, correct.\n\nSo, summarizing three-digit numbers:\n\n4's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 40\n- Units place: 39\nTotal 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\n8's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 39\n- Units place: 39\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check the counts.\n\nWait, for 4's in the hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place for 4's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-449) = 40. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 40.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nTens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nUnits place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's and 8's across single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, so total 4's are 188 and total 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did the three-digit counts correctly because 168 seems high for 4's. Let me recount:\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTens place for 4's: in each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-449), each has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 4 hundreds, 10 each: 40.\n\nUnits place for 4's: in each hundred, 10 numbers where the units digit is 4, except the last hundred (400-488) where it's 9 numbers because 494 is beyond 488. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\nTens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nUnits place: same as tens place, 39.\n\nSo, 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nAdding single and two-digit counts:\n\n4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the two-digit numbers. Earlier, I thought that in two-digit numbers, both 4's and 8's appeared 19 times each, but let me check that again.\n\nIn two-digit numbers:\n\n4's in tens place: 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\n4's in units place: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, so 9 4's.\n\nTotal 4's in two-digit: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in tens place: 80-89, 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\n8's in units place: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 8's.\n\nTotal 8's in two-digit: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nSo, that part seems correct.\n\nAdding single-digit:\n\n4's: 1, 8's:1.\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a large difference. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this by considering each digit position separately across all page numbers.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, for units digit:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, each units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, how many complete cycles are there?\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete cycles and 8 extra numbers.\n\nIn each cycle, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once.\n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 48 cycles * 1 = 48, plus in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Units 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier count. Earlier, I had 39 + 9 = 48 for units 4's in three-digit numbers, but this method suggests 49. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's reconcile this. Using the cycle method:\n\nTotal page numbers: 488.\n\nUnits digit cycles every 10 pages. So, 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, with 8 extra pages (481-488).\n\nIn each full cycle, 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once.\n\nSo, units 4's: 48 * 1 = 48, plus in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Units 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for tens digit:\n\nEach tens digit cycles every 100 pages, with each digit appearing 10 times in each cycle.\n\nTotal page numbers: 488.\n\nNumber of full hundreds: 4 (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n\nIn each full hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\nBut wait, the last hundred is only up to 488, so the tens digits go from 0-8 in 400-488, but let's see.\n\nWait, for tens digit:\n\nEach hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 appears 10 times in each, and 8 appears 10 times in each.\n\nFor the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for the tens digit in 400-488:\n\n- 400-409: tens digit 0\n- 410-419: tens digit 1\n- ...\n- 480-488: tens digit 8, but only 9 numbers (480-488).\n\nSo, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nSimilarly, tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total tens 4's:\n\nFirst three hundreds: 3 * 10 = 30.\n\nLast hundred: 10.\n\nTotal: 30 + 10 = 40.\n\nTens 8's:\n\nFirst three hundreds: 3 * 10 = 30.\n\nLast hundred: 9.\n\nTotal: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, total tens 4's: 40, tens 8's: 39.\n\nNow, hundreds digit:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the hundreds digit is:\n\n- 1: 100-199 (100 numbers)\n- 2: 200-299 (100 numbers)\n- 3: 300-399 (100 numbers)\n- 4: 400-488 (89 numbers)\n\nSo, hundreds digit 4 occurs 89 times, and hundreds digit 8 never occurs because the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, hundreds 4's: 89, hundreds 8's: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all digits:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 40\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 40 + 89 = 178.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 188. Hmm, discrepancy here. Let me check.\n\nWait, using the cycle method for units digit, I got 49 4's and 49 8's in units place.\n\nFor tens digit, 40 4's and 39 8's.\n\nFor hundreds digit, 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 40 + 89 = 178.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 39 + 0 = 88.\n\nDifference: 178 - 88 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did it by hundreds, tens, and units separately, I got 188 4's and 98 8's, which also gave a difference of 90. So, both methods agree on the difference, but the total counts differ because I must have made a mistake in one of the methods.\n\nWait, in the first method, I had:\n\nSingle-digit 4's:1, two-digit 4's:19, three-digit 4's:168. Total:1+19+168=188.\n\nBut using the cycle method, I got 178 4's. So, there's a discrepancy of 10. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I overcounted in the first method. Let me check.\n\nIn the first method, for three-digit numbers:\n\n4's in hundreds place: 89 (correct).\n\n4's in tens place: 40 (correct).\n\n4's in units place: 39 (but using the cycle method, it's 49).\n\nWait, that's where the discrepancy is. Because in the first method, I thought that in 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs 9 times, but in reality, using the cycle method, it's 10 times in the first 400-409, 410-419, etc., but wait, 400-488 includes 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, how many times does the units digit 4 occur?\n\nFrom 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs at 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times, right? Because 494 is beyond 488. So, in the cycle method, I thought it was 49, but that might be incorrect.\n\nWait, using the cycle method, the total units 4's are 49, which would include 404, 414, ..., 484, which is 9 times in 400-488, plus 48 full cycles before that. Wait, no, the cycle method counts all units digits across all page numbers.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the cycle method. Let me think again.\n\nTotal page numbers:488.\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 488 /10 = 48 full cycles, with 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n\nIn each cycle, 4 appears once, so 48 times. In the last 8 numbers, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total units 4's: 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, units 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nBut in the first method, for three-digit numbers, I had units 4's as 39, which is 10+10+10+9=39. But according to the cycle method, it's 49.\n\nWait, that suggests that in the first method, I undercounted the units 4's by 10. Because 49 - 39 =10.\n\nWait, why? Let me check.\n\nIn the first method, I considered single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers separately.\n\nIn single-digit: 4 appears once in units place.\n\nIn two-digit: 14,24,...,94, which is 9 times.\n\nIn three-digit: 104,114,...,194 (10), 204,...,294 (10), 304,...,394 (10), and 404,...,484 (9). So, total units 4's:1 +9 +10+10+10+9= 49. Wait, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the first method, when I added up single-digit (1), two-digit (19), and three-digit (168), I got 188 4's. But according to the cycle method, it's 178 4's.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the three-digit counts. Let me check:\n\nIn the first method, I had:\n\nThree-digit 4's:\n\n- Hundreds:89\n- Tens:40\n- Units:39\nTotal:89+40+39=168.\n\nBut according to the cycle method, total 4's are 178, which would mean that in three-digit numbers, the 4's are 178 - (single-digit 1 + two-digit 19) = 178 - 20 = 158.\n\nBut according to the first method, three-digit 4's are 168, which is 10 more than 158. So, where is the discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps in the hundreds place, I overcounted. Because in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488), which is correct.\n\nTens place: 40 times, correct.\n\nUnits place: 39 times, but according to the cycle method, it's 49 -1 (single-digit) -9 (two-digit) = 49-10=39. Wait, no, because in the cycle method, units 4's are 49, which includes single-digit (4), two-digit (9), and three-digit (36). Wait, no, 49 total units 4's: single-digit (1), two-digit (9), three-digit (39). So, 1+9+39=49.\n\nWait, but in the first method, I had three-digit units 4's as 39, which is correct. So, why the discrepancy in total 4's?\n\nIn the first method:\n\nTotal 4's:1 (single) +19 (two-digit) +168 (three-digit) =188.\n\nIn the cycle method:\n\nTotal 4's:49 (units) +40 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =178.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 4's in hundreds, tens, and units should add up correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that in the first method, I added single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit 4's, but in the cycle method, I added units, tens, and hundreds 4's, which should be the same. But they're not matching.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the first method by including single-digit and two-digit in the three-digit counts. Wait, no, in the first method, I separated them into single, two, and three-digit.\n\nWait, perhaps the error is that in the first method, when I counted three-digit 4's, I included all three-digit numbers, but in the cycle method, I counted all page numbers, including single and two-digit. So, perhaps the first method is correct, and the cycle method is wrong.\n\nWait, but the cycle method seems more accurate because it's a standard way to count digit occurrences.\n\nWait, let me think again. The cycle method counts each digit position separately across all page numbers, so it should be accurate.\n\nIn the cycle method:\n\nUnits 4's:49\n\nTens 4's:40\n\nHundreds 4's:89\n\nTotal 4's:49+40+89=178.\n\nSimilarly, units 8's:49\n\nTens 8's:39\n\nHundreds 8's:0\n\nTotal 8's:49+39=88.\n\nDifference:178-88=90.\n\nBut in the first method, I had 188-98=90.\n\nWait, both methods give the same difference, but different total counts. That suggests that the difference is correct, but the total counts are wrong. So, the difference is 90, but the total counts are off because of an error in one of the methods.\n\nWait, perhaps in the first method, I overcounted the three-digit 4's. Let me check:\n\nThree-digit 4's:\n\n- Hundreds:89\n- Tens:40\n- Units:39\nTotal:168.\n\nBut according to the cycle method, total 4's are 178, which would mean that in three-digit numbers, the 4's are 178 - (single-digit 1 + two-digit 19) = 158. So, 158 vs 168 in the first method. So, I over"

    "text": " Maybe I should separate the counting based on the number of digits.\n\nLet me start by considering single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears once (page 4), and the digit 8 appears once (page 8). So, in single-digit pages, both 4 and 8 appear the same number of times.\n\nNext, I'll look at the two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should count the number of times 4 appears in the tens place and the number of times it appears in the units place separately, and then do the same for 8.\n\nStarting with the tens place for 4: The tens digit is 4 in the range 40-49. That's 10 pages, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For the units place, 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so from 10-99, it would be 10 times as well (4,14,24,...,94). So, in total, 4 appears 10 (tens) + 10 (units) = 20 times in two-digit pages.\n\nNow for 8 in the two-digit numbers. The tens digit is 8 in the range 80-89, which is 10 pages, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. In the units place, 8 appears once every 10 numbers, so from 10-99, that's 9 times (8,18,28,...,88). Wait, is that correct? Let me check: starting from 10, the units digit 8 would be at 8,18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. Wait, that's 9 times because from 10-99, the first occurrence is at 18, not 8, which is single-digit. So, 9 times in the units place. So, 8 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times in two-digit pages.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, in two-digit numbers, the units digit 8 would start at 18, so from 18, 28, ..., 98. That's 9 numbers, right? Because 18 is the first two-digit number ending with 8, then every 10 numbers after that. So, 9 times. So, total for 8 in two-digit pages is 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nSo, in two-digit pages, 4 appears 20 times and 8 appears 19 times. So, 4 appears one more time than 8 in two-digit pages.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because each page number has a hundreds place, a tens place, and a units place. I'll need to consider each digit position separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nLet me start by considering the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because 488 is the last page. So, for the hundreds place, 4 appears only in the range 400-488. How many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, meaning 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, for the tens place in three-digit numbers. I'll need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nFirst, for 4 in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 440-449. Let me check each of these ranges:\n\n- 140-149: 10 pages\n- 240-249: 10 pages\n- 340-349: 10 pages\n- 440-449: 10 pages\n\nSo, that's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 pages, so 4*10 = 40 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nWait, but hold on, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 40 times.\n\nNow, for 8 in the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 pages (480 to 488 inclusive). So, let's calculate each:\n\n- 180-189: 10 pages\n- 280-289: 10 pages\n- 380-389: 10 pages\n- 480-488: 9 pages\n\nSo, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 pages, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, I'll count 4's and 8's separately.\n\nStarting with 4 in the units place. The units digit is 4 in every set of 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488, I can count how many times 4 appears in the units place.\n\nIn each hundred, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in 100-199, the units digit is 4 at 104,114,124,...,194. That's 10 times. Similarly, in 200-299, it's 204,214,...,294: 10 times. In 300-399, it's 304,314,...,394: 10 times. Now, in 400-488, the units digit is 4 at 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 times because 484 is within 488, but 494 would be beyond. So, 9 times.\n\nWait, let me check: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Yes, that's 9 numbers. So, in total, 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times 4 appears in the units place.\n\nNow for 8 in the units place. Similarly, in each hundred, the units digit is 8 every 10 numbers.\n\nIn 100-199: 108,118,...,198: 10 times.\n\nIn 200-299: 208,218,...,298: 10 times.\n\nIn 300-399: 308,318,...,398: 10 times.\n\nIn 400-488: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 times because 488 is included, but 498 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, total 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times 8 appears in the units place.\n\nWait, but wait a second. In 400-488, the units digit 8 occurs at 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 times, correct. So, total units digit 8's: 39.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, I had 89 times 4, right? So, for three-digit numbers, let me sum up the counts for 4 and 8.\n\nFor 4 in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\n- Tens place: 40 times\n- Units place: 39 times\nTotal for 4: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 times.\n\nFor 8 in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0 times because 800-899 is beyond 488, so no 8 in hundreds place.\n- Tens place: 39 times\n- Units place: 39 times\nTotal for 8: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 times.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, in three-digit numbers, the hundreds digit can't be 8 because the book only goes up to 488, so 800-899 isn't included. So, yes, hundreds place for 8 is zero. So, total 8's in three-digit numbers are 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\nNow, let me sum up all the counts for 4 and 8 across all page numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit pages:\n\n- 4: 1\n- 8: 1\n\nTwo-digit pages:\n\n- 4: 20\n- 8: 19\n\nThree-digit pages:\n\n- 4: 168\n- 8: 78\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 20 + 168 = 189\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nWait, so 189 4's and 98 8's. So, the difference is 189 - 98 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, let me double-check the counts for three-digit numbers because that's where most of the numbers are.\n\nIn three-digit numbers:\n\nFor 4:\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n- Tens place: 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10 pages, so 4*10=40.\n- Units place: In each hundred, 10 times except the last one which is 9 times, so 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 10+10+10+9=39.\n- Units place: 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, 39+39=78. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 (single) + 20 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 189.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\nDifference: 189 - 98 = 91.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 91 seems like a big number. Let me check the two-digit counts again.\n\nIn two-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's: tens place 40-49 (10) and units place 4,14,...,94 (10). So, 20 total.\n- 8's: tens place 80-89 (10) and units place 18,28,...,98 (9). So, 19 total.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSingle-digit: both 4 and 8 appear once.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 1+20+168=189.\n\n8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nDifference: 189-98=91.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place for three-digit numbers. Let me check again.\n\nIn three-digit numbers, for units digit 4:\n\n- 100-199: 104,114,...,194: 10 times\n- 200-299: 204,...,294:10\n- 300-399:304,...,394:10\n- 400-488:404,414,...,484: Let's count them. 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484: that's 9 times.\n\nSo, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSimilarly, for units digit 8:\n\n- 100-199:108,118,...,198:10\n- 200-299:208,...,298:10\n- 300-399:308,...,398:10\n- 400-488:408,418,...,488: Let's count. 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488: 9 times.\n\nSo, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the difference is 91.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. When considering the hundreds place for 4, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, but in those, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 times. But when I'm counting 4's in the tens and units places in the 400-488 range, I have to make sure I'm not double-counting. Wait, no, because when I count 4's in the tens place, I'm considering all ranges where tens digit is 4, regardless of the hundreds digit. Similarly for units place. So, no double-counting because each position is considered separately.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: for each digit position (hundreds, tens, units), I'm counting how many times 4 or 8 appears in that specific position across all page numbers. So, the counts are independent, so adding them up is correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct, and the difference is 91. Therefore, 4's are printed 91 more times than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is 189, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 91.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should tackle each digit position separately\u2014units, tens, and hundreds places. Let me start by considering each position one by one.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's and 8's in the units place. For the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each set of ten numbers. So, for example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. This pattern repeats every 10 numbers. Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and then 8 more pages (481-488). In each complete set of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 sets, that's 48*1=48 fours and 48*1=48 eights. Now, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8. So, in these, the units digit 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, adding those, total units place fours would be 48+1=49, and eights would be 48+1=49. So, so far, the count for units place is equal for both 4 and 8.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, that would be 10 times in each hundred, and similarly for 8. Now, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each of the 4 complete hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4*10=40 fours. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4*10=40 eights. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490). Wait, but 488 is less than 490, so the tens digit goes up to 8, but only up to 488. So, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). Now, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Let's see: 441-450 would have 4 in the tens place, but wait, 441-450 is actually part of the 400s. Wait, no, 401-410 is tens digit 0, 411-420 is 1, and so on up to 481-490 being tens digit 8. But since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times here. Similarly, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 441-450 is within 401-488, so that's 10 pages where the tens digit is 4. So, in the tens place, in the last partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times. So, adding that to the previous counts: fours in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, eights in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48. So, in the tens place, fours are 50 and eights are 48.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, eights in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when counting, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- Each 10 numbers have one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 pages: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48 each, plus the last 8 pages (481-488) where 484 has a 4 and 488 has an 8. So, 48 +1=49 fours, 48 +1=49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred has 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n- 4 full hundreds: 4*10=40 each.\n- The last 88 pages: 401-488. The tens digits go from 0 to 8. For 4 in the tens place, it's 441-450, which is 10 pages. For 8, it's 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, that's 8 pages. So, 10 fours and 8 eights. So, total tens place: 40+10=50 fours, 40+8=48 eights. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n- 8 never appears. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 +50 +89= 188\nTotal 8's: 49 +48 +0=97\nDifference: 188 -97=91\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place in the last partial hundred. Let me check again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490). So, for each tens digit, it's 10 numbers, except possibly the last one if it's cut short.\n\nBut in 401-488, the last tens digit is 8, but only up to 488, so 481-488 is 8 numbers, not 10. So, for the tens digit 8, it's 8 numbers, so 8 eights in the tens place. For the tens digit 4, it's 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to check: Let's calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place again.\n\nUnits place:\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1 four and 1 eight. So, 48 each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8. So, 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So, 48 +1=49 fours, 48 +1=49 eights.\n\nTens place:\n- 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds. Each full hundred has 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 each.\n- Now, the last 88 pages (401-488). The tens digits here are 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490). So, how many times does each tens digit appear?\n- For each tens digit from 0 to 8, except the last one which is cut short at 488, it's 10 pages. But the last tens digit (8) only goes up to 488, which is 8 pages (481-488). So, for tens digit 4, it's 10 pages (441-450), so 10 fours. For tens digit 8, it's 8 pages, so 8 eights. So, adding to the previous 40, we get 40+10=50 fours and 40+8=48 eights.\n\nHundreds place:\n- The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 pages (488 - 400 +1=89). So, 89 fours.\n- No 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =97\nDifference: 188 -97=91\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 91.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{91}."

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit position separately, like units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Let's start with the units place. For the units digit, every 10 numbers, the digit cycles through 0-9. So, in every set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for the units place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 do we have? Let me calculate 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. So, there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each complete set, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once more in 484. So, total 4's in units place would be 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, for 8's in the units place, each complete set of 10 has one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers, 8 appears once in 488. So, total 8's in units place would be 48 + 1 = 49. So, so far, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. Hmm, that's interesting. Now, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 0 for 0-9, 1 for 10-19, up to 9 for 90-99. So, in each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. Now, let's calculate for 488 pages. How many hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds and then 88 extra pages. In each complete hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for 4 complete hundreds, 4 appears 4*10 = 40 times, and 8 appears 4*10 = 40 times. Now, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), we need to check the tens digit. Let's break this down: pages 401-409: tens digit is 0. Pages 410-419: tens digit is 1. Pages 420-429: tens digit is 2. Pages 430-439: tens digit is 3. Pages 440-449: tens digit is 4. Pages 450-459: tens digit is 5. Pages 460-469: tens digit is 6. Pages 470-479: tens digit is 7. Pages 480-488: tens digit is 8. So, in the tens place for the remaining 88 pages, how many 4's and 8's are there? Let's see: from 440-449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. From 480-488, the tens digit is 8, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place. So, total in the tens place: 4's are 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. 8's are 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. Now, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. From 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0. From 100-488, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's see how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. For 8's in the hundreds place, since 888 is beyond 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, total in the hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0. Now, let's sum up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me verify each digit place again.\n\nUnits place:\n- For 4's: 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Then in 481-488, 484 has a 4, so 49 total. Correct.\n- For 8's: Similarly, 48 complete sets, then 488 has an 8, so 49 total. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Complete hundreds: 4*10=40 for both 4 and 8.\n- Remaining 88 pages:\n  - 440-449: 10 times for 4.\n  - 480-488: 9 times for 8.\nSo, 4's: 40 + 10 = 50, 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears from 400-488: 89 times.\n- 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Total 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90. Yes, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately, we determine that the digit 4 appears 188 times and the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, each digit (0-9) appears once in the units place.\n   - For 488 pages: 48 complete sets of 10 (48\u00d710=480) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n   - **4's:** 48 times from sets + 1 in 484 = 49.\n   - **8's:** 48 times from sets + 1 in 488 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contains 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n   - For 488 pages: 4 complete hundreds (4\u00d710=40 each for 4 and 8).\n   - Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n     - **4's:** 10 times in 440-449.\n     - **8's:** 9 times in 480-488.\n   - **4's:** 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - **8's:** 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times from 400-488.\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **4's:** 89.\n   - **8's:** 0.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start with the 4's. \n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in the units place. For every block of 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488). In each of the 48 blocks, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1 to 8, so no 4's there. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99, there's 40-49, that's one. From 100-199, 140-149, that's another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's five ranges, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 times 10 is 50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 pages, so that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. So, total 4's are units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's. Starting with the units place. Again, in every block of 10 pages, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so each block has exactly one 8. There are 48 complete blocks (since 488/10 is 48.8), so 48 8's in the units place. The extra 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so the last page is 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, in the extra 8 pages, there's one 8 (page 488). So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nMoving on to the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges are within 488. From 0-99, 80-89 is one range. 180-189 is another, 280-289 another, and 380-389 another. So that's four ranges, each with 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Now, what about 480-488? The tens digit here is 8, but only from 480 to 488, which is 9 pages (480-488). So, in the tens place, we have 9 more 8's. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's are 0.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so 4's are 187 and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98. Let me calculate that: 187 - 98 is 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But wait, when I was calculating the units place for 8's, I considered the extra 8 pages (481-488) and found one 8. But page 488 is included, so that's correct. For the tens place, I considered 80-89, etc., up to 380-389, which are four ranges, each contributing 10 8's, so 40. Then, 480-488 is another 9 pages with 8 in the tens place, so 40 + 9 = 49. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the 4's in the tens place. I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five ranges, each with 10 4's, so 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place. \n\nWait, but when I think about the hundreds place for 4's, it's 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I included all the 4's correctly. For units, it's every 10 pages, so 488/10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, the last partial cycle is 8 pages, which doesn't include a 4, so that's correct. So, 48 units 4's.\n\nTens place: 40-49 is 10 pages, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 pages, so 5 ranges, 50 4's.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full cycles, 48 8's, plus the last 8 pages (481-488), which includes 488, so one more 8, making 49.\n\nTens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. From 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four contributes 10, and the last contributes 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, when I'm counting 8's, is 480-488 correctly accounted for? Yes, because the tens digit is 8, so from 480 to 488, which is 9 pages, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98, so there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\nTo find the number of 4's:\n- **Units place**: 48 (from each block of 10 pages up to 480, with no additional 4's in the last 8 pages).\n- **Tens place**: 50 (from ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place**: 89 (from pages 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nTo find the number of 8's:\n- **Units place**: 49 (48 from each block of 10 pages up to 480, plus one in the last 8 pages).\n- **Tens place**: 49 (from ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place**: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start with the units place.\n\nFor the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, every 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. But since we're starting from 1, maybe it's better to think in terms of complete groups of 10 and then handle the remaining numbers. Let me calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488 pages. \n\n488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1, which is 48, plus any extra in the last partial group. In the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, adding that, the total 4's in units place would be 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place contributes equally to both 4's and 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 1 to 480, that's 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 each. Then from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, the units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, yes, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, units place gives 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred. Let me see how many hundreds we have in 488 pages.\n\nWe have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). Wait, no, 400 to 488 is 89 pages, but maybe I should think in terms of hundreds. Let me see, 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, 4 complete hundreds and 88 pages beyond that.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each hundred. Therefore, for the 4 complete hundreds, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place each hundred, so 4*10=40 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, so 4*10=40 times.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 pages are from 401 to 488. Let's see how the tens digit behaves here. From 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). Wait, but 401 is part of the 400-499 range, but we're only going up to 488. So, let me list the tens digits from 401 to 488.\n\nThe tens digit in 401-410 is 0 (for 401-410), then 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). So, each of these tens digits occurs 10 times except the last one, which occurs only 8 times (since 488 is the last page). So, for the tens digit in 401-488, how many times does 4 appear? It's in 441-450, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 times. So, in the tens place for the remaining 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in the tens place would be 40 (from the 4 hundreds) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50 times. And 8's in the tens place would be 40 (from the 4 hundreds) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48 times.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because in the 401-488 range, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8, but each tens digit except the last one occurs 10 times. So, from 401-410, tens digit is 0 (10 times), 411-420 is 1 (10 times), and so on up to 471-480 is 7 (10 times), and then 481-488 is 8 (8 times). So, for the 401-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 times, and 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 times. So, yes, 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times. How about 8? Well, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for 400-488, and before that, it's 3 for 300-399, 2 for 200-299, etc. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, 4's in hundreds place: 89 times, and 8's: 0 times.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91. So, there are 91 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 488 pages, so 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing 1 four and 1 eight in units place. 48*1=48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) contribute 1 four (484) and 1 eight (488). So, 48+1=49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, 10 times each digit in tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 4*10=40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (441-450) and 8 occurs 8 times (481-488). So, 40+10=50 for 4's, 40+8=48 for 8's. That looks right.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times. 8 never appears in hundreds place, so 0. Correct.\n\nAdding up: 4's: 49+50+89=188. 8's:49+48+0=97. Difference: 188-97=91.\n\nWait, but I just thought, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nAnother way to check: Let me calculate total number of digits printed. From 1-9: 9 numbers, 1 digit each: 9 digits. From 10-99: 90 numbers, 2 digits each: 180 digits. From 100-488: 389 numbers, 3 digits each: 1167 digits. Total digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits. Now, the total number of 4's and 8's should be a part of these digits. 4's: 188, 8's:97, so total 285 digits. 285 is less than 1356, so that seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's another way. But perhaps it's better to proceed as I did before.\n\nWait, another thought: When counting the hundreds place, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 times. So, 89 4's in hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, as I thought, 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, 10 and 8.\n\nIn the units place, as calculated, 49 each.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 -97=91.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 complete groups, contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - Last 8 numbers (481-488) add 1 more 4 (484) and 1 more 8 (488).\n   - Total: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times per hundred.\n   - 4 complete hundreds contribute 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - From 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total: 50 4's and 48 8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract the two counts to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by calculating the number of times the digit 4 appears. I'll need to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Similarly, I'll do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. Units place: In the units place, the digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 fours. But wait, in the last partial group (481-488), does the units digit reach 4? Yes, 484 is within that range, so that's one more 4. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 10 numbers every 100. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So how many such blocks are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Now, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So that's 10 more fours. So total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488. So that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nAdding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to the 4's, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. That's 48 eights. In the last partial group (481-488), the units digit is 8 in 488, so that's one more. So total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block contributes 10 eights. So how many such blocks are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds. Each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. In the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. Wait, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers. So that's 9 eights in the tens place. So total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 eights. 100-199: 180-189 is another 10. 200-299: 280-289: 10. 300-399: 380-389: 10. Then 400-488: 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), each with 8 in the tens place. So yes, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So total tens place 8's are 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So there are 98 eights in total.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor the 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 full decades (1-480), each contributing one 4, so 48. Then 484 is in 481-488, so +1, total 49.\n\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place (like 40-49 in each hundred), so 4*10=40. Then in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so +10, total 50.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 pages, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then 488 has an 8 in the units place, so +1, total 49.\n\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place (like 80-89), so 4*10=40. Then in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so +9, total 49.\n\n- Hundreds: None, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo 188 - 98 = 90. So there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So each digit appears once in the units place every ten numbers. Now, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times. But wait, since we're starting from 1, the first set is 1-10, so the 0 in the units place actually doesn't appear until page 10. Hmm, but when calculating the number of times a digit appears, I think we can still consider each set of ten starting from 0-9, so maybe the count remains accurate. So, for the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times, and the digit 8 appears 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so in the units place, 4 appears once more (page 484) and 8 appears once more (page 488). So, total units place counts: 4's = 48 +1 = 49, 8's = 48 +1 = 49. So, in units place, they're equal. Now, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 0-99, the tens digits go 0 (10 times, 1-10), 1 (10 times, 11-20), up to 9 (10 times, 91-100). But since our book ends at 488, which is less than 500, we need to adjust for that. Let's see: from 1-99, the tens digits go from 0 (for pages 1-9, but wait, actually the tens digit is 0 for pages 1-9, but when considering two-digit numbers, the tens digit starts at 1 for 10-19, etc. Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let's consider each hundred block separately.\n\nFrom 1-99:\n- Pages 1-9: tens digit is 0.\n- Pages 10-19: tens digit is 1.\n- Pages 20-29: tens digit is 2.\n- ...\n- Pages 90-99: tens digit is 9.\n\nSo, each tens digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for pages 1-99. But actually, pages 1-9 have a tens digit of 0, so 0 appears 9 times? Wait, no, because in page 1, the tens digit is 0 (since it's 01 if we consider two digits, but in reality, it's just 1, so maybe the tens digit isn't printed for single-digit pages. Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should treat single-digit pages as having no tens digit, so when considering the tens place, only pages 10 and above have a tens digit. So, in that case, from 10-99, the tens digit cycles 0-9, each appearing 10 times. So, in the tens place, digits 0-9 each appear 10 times in the 10-99 range. Then, from 100-199, the tens digit again cycles 0-9 ten times each, so another 10 times for each digit. Similarly, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, 400-488 is only 89 pages, so the tens digit cycles 0-8, each appearing 9 or 10 times? Wait, let me clarify.\n\nLet me break it down by hundreds:\n\n1. Pages 1-9: single-digit, no tens digit.\n2. Pages 10-99: two-digit numbers. Tens digits go from 1 (for 10-19) to 9 (for 90-99), each appearing 10 times. So, in the tens place, digits 1-9 each appear 10 times, and 0 doesn't appear because there's no page 0-9 in the tens place for two-digit numbers. Wait, no, 10-19 have tens digit 1, 20-29 have 2, etc., up to 90-99 with 9. So, each digit 1-9 appears 10 times in the tens place from 10-99.\n\n3. Pages 100-199: three-digit numbers. The tens digit cycles 0-9 for each hundred. So, for 100-109, tens digit is 0; 110-119, tens digit is 1; ... up to 190-199, tens digit is 9. Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred block.\n\nSimilarly, pages 200-299: same pattern, tens digits 0-9 each appearing 10 times.\n\nPages 300-399: same.\n\nPages 400-488: this is a partial hundred block. Let's see: from 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, for tens digits 0-8, how many times do they appear?\n\nEach tens digit from 0-8 appears 10 times for each ten pages. So, from 400-488:\n\n- Tens digit 0: pages 400-409: 10 pages, but since we're only going up to 488, 400-409 is 10 pages, so tens digit 0 appears 10 times.\n- Tens digit 1: 410-419: 10 times.\n- ...\n- Tens digit 8: 480-488: 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place for 400-488, digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the tens digits:\n\n- From 10-99: digits 1-9 each appear 10 times.\n- From 100-399: each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, 100-199: 10 each, 200-299: 10 each, 300-399: 10 each. So that's 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 times for each digit 0-9. So, digits 0-9 each appear 30 times in the tens place from 100-399.\n- From 400-488: digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total for the tens place:\n\n- Digit 0: 0 (from 10-99) + 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 40\n- Digit 1: 10 + 30 + 10 = 50\n- ...\nWait, no. Wait, from 10-99, digits 1-9 each appear 10 times in the tens place. From 100-399, each digit 0-9 appears 30 times (since 3 hundreds, each 10 times). From 400-488, digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, for digit 4 in the tens place:\n\nFrom 10-99: 10 times (since tens digit 4 is 40-49)\nFrom 100-399: 30 times (each hundred contributes 10)\nFrom 400-488: 10 times (since 400-409 is tens digit 0, 410-419 is 1, ..., 440-449 is 4, which is 10 times)\nWait, no, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages (440-449). So, 10 times.\n\nSo total for digit 4 in tens place: 10 + 30 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in the tens place:\n\nFrom 10-99: 10 times (80-89)\nFrom 100-399: 30 times\nFrom 400-488: 9 times (since 480-488 is 9 pages)\nSo total: 10 + 30 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, so in the tens place, digit 4 appears 50 times, and digit 8 appears 49 times. So, digit 4 is ahead by 1 in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present in three-digit numbers, which are pages 100-488.\n\nThe hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, appearing 100 times.\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, 100 times.\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, 100 times.\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times (since 400-488 is 89 pages).\n\nSo, digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all because there are no pages 800-899.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, digit 4 appears 89 times, and digit 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences:\n\nFor digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n- 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in units place: 48 each.\n- Last partial set: 481-488, units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\nSo, units: 48 +1 =49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- From 10-99: 10 times each for 4 and 8 in tens place.\n- From 100-399: 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 times for each digit, so 30 times each.\n- From 400-488: tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. Tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 times.\nSo, 4: 10 +30 +10=50\n8: 10 +30 +9=49\nYes, that's correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears in 400-488: 89 times.\n- 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place.\nSo, 4:89, 8:0.\n\nAdding up:\n4:49+50+89=188\n8:49+49+0=98\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nHmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for digit 4. Pages 400-488 are 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, which is 89 times. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me check the total number of pages. 488 pages. So, pages 1-99:99 pages, 100-399:300 pages, 400-488:89 pages. 99+300+89=488. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should separate the counting based on the number of digits to make it easier.\n\nLet me start by considering single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the only single-digit numbers that have a 4 or an 8 are 4 and 8 themselves. So, for single-digit pages, there's exactly one 4 and one 8. That means the count so far is 1 for 4's and 1 for 8's.\n\nNext, I'll move on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately in each place.\n\nStarting with the tens place: For the tens digit, 4 appears in the 40-49 range. That's 10 pages (40 to 49), so that's 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Similarly, 8 appears in the 80-89 range, which is another 10 pages, so 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place: In the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once every 10 numbers. So, for two-digit numbers, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, from 10 to 99, there are 9 sets of 10 numbers (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99). In each set, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 9 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once in each set, so also 9 times.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. The two-digit numbers start at 10, so the first set is 10-19, and the last set is 90-99. That's 9 sets, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, that's 9 each for 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\nPutting it together for two-digit numbers: 10 (tens place for 4) + 9 (units place for 4) = 19 occurrences of 4. Similarly, 10 (tens place for 8) + 9 (units place for 8) = 19 occurrences of 8.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, 4's appear 19 times and 8's appear 19 times.\n\nNow, let's move on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This might be a bit more complicated because there are three places: hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nFirst, I think I should break it down by each digit place: hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nNow, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Only in the 400-488 range. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a three-digit number, the hundreds digit can't be 8 because the book only goes up to 488. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers: Here, I need to consider how often 4 and 8 appear in the tens digit across all three-digit page numbers (100-488).\n\nLet me think. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each hundred. So, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit goes through 0-9 ten times each, except maybe for the last hundred, 400-488, which only goes up to 8 in the tens place because 488 is the last page.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the hundreds, each hundred block (like 100-199) has 100 numbers, so the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. Wait, no, actually, each digit in the tens place appears 10 times per hundred. For example, in 100-199, each tens digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times (e.g., 0 appears in 100-109, 10 times; 1 appears in 110-119, 10 times, etc.).\n\nBut for 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0-8, but only up to 8 in the tens place because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, 400-488 includes numbers like 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. So, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, but for each tens digit except the last one (8), it's 10 numbers. For the last tens digit, 8, it's only 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in 400-488.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. For each tens digit from 0 to 7, each appears 10 times (e.g., 400-409, 410-419, etc., each has 10 numbers). But for tens digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears how many times? Well, 4 is one of the digits from 0-9, so in each hundred except the last one, it appears 10 times. But in the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in each hundred except maybe the last one? Wait, no, 400-488 includes 400-499, but the book stops at 488, so 400-488 is only up to 488. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in each hundred except maybe the last one, but in this case, 440-449 is fully included because 449 is less than 488. So, actually, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds and 10 times in the last hundred as well. So, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 40 times. Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so does that affect the count?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think differently. For each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles 0-9 for each hundred except the last one, which is cut off at 488. So, in each of the first three hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. In the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 times. So, total for the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in each of the four hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place: In each of the first three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit 8 appears 10 times. In the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds and 9 times in the last hundred. So, total for the tens place, 8 appears 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, but let me verify that. For 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, that's 3 * 10 = 30. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's 9. So, total 30 + 9 = 39 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Here, each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred block, each digit appears 10 times in the units place. So, for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the units place, and 8 appears 10 times as well.\n\nBut wait, for the last hundred, 400-488, the units digit goes up to 8 in the last number, 488. So, does that affect the count? Let me think. For each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each set of 10 numbers. So, in 400-409, units digits 0-9 each appear once. Similarly, 410-419, etc., up to 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so the units digits go from 0-8, missing 9. So, in 400-488, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the units place?\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. For each hundred block except the last one, the units digit 4 and 8 each appear 10 times. In the last hundred, 400-488, the units digit 4 appears how many times? Let's see. From 400-488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? That would be 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times because 484 is within 488, but 494 would be beyond 488, so it's only 9 times. Similarly, 8 in the units place would be 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 times as well.\n\nWait, but wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, for the units digit, in each hundred except the last, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times. In the last hundred, they each appear 9 times. So, total for the units place:\n\nFor 4: 3 hundreds * 10 + 1 hundred * 9 = 30 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nFor 8: Similarly, 3 hundreds * 10 + 1 hundred * 9 = 30 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, but wait, in the last hundred, 400-488, the units digit 4 appears in 404, 414, ..., 484, which is 9 times because 494 is beyond 488. Similarly, 8 appears in 408, 418, ..., 488, which is 9 times. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but wait, let me count the exact number of times 4 and 8 appear in the units place in 400-488.\n\nFor 4 in the units place: The numbers are 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nFor 8 in the units place: The numbers are 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's also 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, in the units place, for three-digit numbers:\n\n4 appears 3*10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\n8 appears 3*10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit odd because in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, but 8 doesn't appear at all. So, maybe I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, in the units place, it's separate from the hundreds place. So, the counts for units and tens are independent.\n\nSo, putting it all together for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n- Units place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. Earlier, I thought that in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4 hundreds would give 40 times. But in the last hundred, 400-488, does the tens digit 4 appear 10 times? Because 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, yes, 40 times for 4 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place, in the first three hundreds, each has 10 occurrences, and in the last hundred, 400-488, it's 9 times, so 3*10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nAnd in the units place, 4 appears 39 times and 8 appears 39 times.\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n\n4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168 times.\n\n8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78 times.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off because 4's in three-digit numbers would be more than 8's, which makes sense because 4 is in the hundreds place a lot.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences:\n\nSingle-digit:\n4's: 1\n8's: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n4's: 19\n8's: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n4's: 168\n8's: 78\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nWait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 = 90, which seems like a big difference. Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me go back step by step.\n\nSingle-digit:\n4's: 1 (page 4)\n8's: 1 (page 8)\nTotal so far: 4's=1, 8's=1\n\nTwo-digit numbers (10-99):\n\nTens place:\n4's: 10 (40-49)\n8's: 10 (80-89)\n\nUnits place:\n4's: For each ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 tens, so 9 times.\nSimilarly, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total for two-digit:\n4's: 10 + 9 = 19\n8's: 10 + 9 = 19\nCumulative total so far:\n4's: 1 + 19 = 20\n8's: 1 + 19 = 20\n\nThree-digit numbers (100-488):\n\nHundreds place:\n4's: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n8's: 0 times.\n\nTens place:\nFor each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times in each hundred except maybe the last one. Wait, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 times. So, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 40 times for 4's.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place: In each of the first three hundreds, 8 appears 10 times. In the last hundred, 400-488, 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, 3*10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nUnits place:\nFor each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the units place. In the last hundred, 400-488, 4 appears 9 times in the units place (as 404, 414, ..., 484). So, 3*10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: In each of the first three hundreds, 8 appears 10 times. In the last hundred, 400-488, 8 appears 9 times (408, 418, ..., 488). So, 3*10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nSo, for three-digit numbers:\n\n4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nAdding up all the counts:\n\nTotal 4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188\nTotal 8's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: For three-digit numbers, the hundreds place adds 89 4's and 0 8's. The tens place adds 40 4's and 39 8's. The units place adds 39 4's and 39 8's. So, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 for 4's, and 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 for 8's. That seems right.\n\nAdding the single and two-digit numbers: 1 + 19 = 20 for 4's, and 1 + 19 = 20 for 8's. So, total 4's: 20 + 168 = 188, and 8's: 20 + 78 = 98. So, the difference is indeed 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the units place in the last hundred would have one less, but I think I accounted for that by subtracting one, resulting in 9 instead of 10 for the units place in the last hundred for both 4 and 8.\n\nSo, after all that, the total number of 4's printed is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 188 - 98 = 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Single-Digit Pages (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - 8 appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-Digit Pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - 4 appears 10 times (40-49).\n     - 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - 4 appears 9 times (once in each ten's group from 10-99).\n     - 8 appears 9 times.\n   - Total for two-digit:\n     - 4: 10 + 9 = 19.\n     - 8: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\n3. **Three-Digit Pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - 4 appears 89 times (pages 400-488).\n     - 8 appears 0 times.\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - 4 appears 10 times in each of the four hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), totaling 40 times.\n     - 8 appears 10 times in the first three hundreds and 9 times in 400-488, totaling 39 times.\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - 4 appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds and 9 times in 400-488, totaling 39 times.\n     - 8 appears similarly, totaling 39 times.\n   - Total for three-digit:\n     - 4: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n     - 8: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **4's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n   - **8's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should approach this by looking at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let's start with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, in every set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each 10 numbers, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and then 8 more pages (481-488). So, in the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1 (from each set) plus an extra if the remaining pages include a 4. Looking at the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, for 8's in units place: 48 times 1 plus the remaining pages. The remaining pages end at 8, so 488 is included, which is an 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, no, because 488 is included, so the units digit 8 appears once more. Wait, let me check again. From 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 +1 =49. Similarly, for 4's, from 1-480, 48 sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, from 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once (484). So, 4's in units place: 48 +1=49. So, both 4 and 8 have 49 in units place. Now, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 1-100, the tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) and then 1-9 for 10-99, each appearing 10 times. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and similarly for 8. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. Wait, but when considering the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for 488 pages, we have 4 complete hundreds (1-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). So, in the tens place, for each hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.), each digit 0-9 appears 10 times. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 times 10, which is 40 occurrences for each digit in the tens place. So, 4's in tens place: 40 times. 8's in tens place: 40 times. Now, we also have the partial hundred from 401-488. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). Wait, no, 401-488 is 88 pages. Let me break it down:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nWait, but 481-488 is only 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in 401-488? Looking at 441-450, the tens digit is 4. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40 (from 1-400) +10 (from 441-450) =50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 (from 1-400) +8 (from 481-488)=48.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 4's in tens place:50, 8's:48.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present from page 100 onwards. For pages 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, but since we're only considering page numbers printed once, maybe we don't count leading zeros. So, from 100-488, the hundreds digit is 1,2,3, or 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. That's 89 pages (400-488 inclusive). So, 89 times.\n\nHow many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check. The hundreds digit goes from 1 to 4 because 488 is the last page. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place:89.\n\nTotal 8's in hundreds place:0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:49 +50 +89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:48\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49 +48 +0=97.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- 4's:48 sets of 10 (1-480) +1 (484)=49\n- 8's:48 sets +1 (488)=49\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4's:40 (from 1-400) +10 (441-450)=50\n- 8's:40 +8 (481-488)=48\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's:89 (400-488)\n- 8's:0\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nHmm, but wait, let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for 481-488. From 481-488, the tens digit is 8 for all these pages, right? So, that's 8 numbers, so 8 times. So, 8's in tens place:40+8=48.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in tens place, from 441-450, that's 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, 4's:50.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 pages (488-400+1=89). So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nBut wait, 400-488 is 89 pages, so yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 188, and 8's are 97, so 188-97=91.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Because from 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the total number of digits printed and see if the counts make sense, but that might be overcomplicating.\n\nWait, another way to check: let's calculate the total number of 4's and 8's in each place.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 4's: floor(488/10)=48, plus if the remainder is >=4, add 1. 488 mod 10=8, which is >=4, so 48+1=49.\n\n- 8's: floor(488/10)=48, plus if the remainder >=8, add 1. 488 mod 10=8, so 48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4's: floor(488/100)=4, which gives 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), how many 4's in the tens place? The tens digit cycles every 100, so in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. The 4 in the tens place occurs from 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So total 4's in tens place:40+10=50.\n\n- 8's: Similarly, floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit 8 occurs from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times. So total 8's in tens place:40+8=48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: floor(488/1000)=0, but since we're dealing with 488, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\n- 8's: Since 488 is less than 800, hundreds digit 8 never occurs, so 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full sets, contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488) add 1 more 4 (484) and 1 more 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's in units place: 49.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - 400 pages contribute 40 4's and 40 8's in the tens place.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n     - 4's: 10 times (441-450).\n     - 8's: 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 50.\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4's: From 400-488, 89 pages with hundreds digit 4.\n   - 8's: None, as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - Total 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by calculating the number of 4's.\n\nFirst, let's look at the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 pages. So, in each of these 48 blocks, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once more in the units place (page 484). So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. In the tens place, the digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49. So, in each block of 100, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, meaning there are 4 full blocks of 100 and then 88 pages. So, in each of the 4 full blocks, we have 10 4's in the tens place, which is 4*10=40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (101-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 again. Wait, no, actually, the remaining pages after 400 would be 401-488. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see, from 400-488, the tens digit is 0 for 400-409, then 1 for 410-419, up to 8 for 480-488. Wait, but I'm looking for 4's in the tens place, so that would be from 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 more 4's in the tens place. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding all these up: units place 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. So, total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through each place again: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in each block of 10, 8 appears once in the units place. There are 48 full blocks of 10 in 488 pages, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more (page 488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. In each block of 100, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 80-89. So, in each 100, that's 10 times. There are 4 full blocks of 100, so 4*10=40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (101-488), we need to check how many times 8 appears in the tens place. From 100-488, the tens digit is 8 in the ranges 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, for the remaining pages, we have 4 occurrences of 8 in the tens place: 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first three contributes 10, but 480-488 is only 9, but wait, 480-488 is actually 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 (from the first 400 pages) plus 9 (from 480-488). So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds place contributes 0 8's.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. So, total 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full blocks *1 =48, plus 1 in the last 8 pages: total 49.\n- Tens: 4 full blocks *10=40, plus 10 in 440-449: total 50.\n- Hundreds: 89 times (400-488): 89.\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full blocks *1=48, plus 1 in the last 8 pages: total 49.\n- Tens: 4 full blocks *10=40, plus 9 in 480-488: total 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but when calculating the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as contributing 9 times, but actually, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for 4's, I had 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I calculated the hundreds place for 4's, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, 488 - 400 +1 = 89, correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's. So, the final answer is \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by considering each place one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, in 1-10, the units digits go from 1 to 0. So, the digit 4 appears once (at page 4) and the digit 8 appears once (at page 8). Similarly, this pattern repeats every 10 pages. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Let me calculate that. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra pages. So, for each complete set of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Therefore, for 48 sets, that's 48 fours and 48 eights. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8. So, in the units place, there's another 4 (at 484) and another 8 (at 488). So, adding those, units place gives us 49 fours and 49 eights.\n\nWait, let me check that. Wait, the remaining pages after 48 sets of 10 would be 48*10=480, so pages 481 to 488. The units digits here are 1 (481), 2 (482), 3 (483), 4 (484), 5 (485), 6 (486), 7 (487), 8 (488). So, yes, 484 has a 4 in the units place, and 488 has an 8. So, units place: 49 fours and 49 eights. That's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every 10 pages. For example, from 10-19, the tens digit is 1; 20-29, it's 2, and so on. So, in each block of 100 pages, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. Wait, no, actually, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place over 100 pages. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, etc., up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place in each 100 pages. \n\nSo, since our book is 488 pages, let's see how many complete hundreds we have. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89). So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4*10=40 fours and 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. Now, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in this range. Specifically, 401-410: tens digit is 0; 410-419: 1; 420-429: 2; 430-439: 3; 440-449: 4; 450-459: 5; 460-469: 6; 470-479: 7; 480-488: 8. So, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place in 401-488?\n\nLet's count:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 401-410: 10 numbers, but since we're starting at 401, that's pages 401-410, which is 10 pages, so tens digit 0 appears 10 times.\n\nWait, but 401-410 is 10 pages, so tens digit 0 appears 10 times. Similarly, 410-419: tens digit 1, 10 pages. 420-429: tens digit 2, 10 pages. 430-439: tens digit 3, 10 pages. 440-449: tens digit 4, 10 pages. 450-459: tens digit 5, 10 pages. 460-469: tens digit 6, 10 pages. 470-479: tens digit 7, 10 pages. 480-488: tens digit 8, but this is only 9 pages (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 pages because 488-480=8, so 9 pages. So, tens digit 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nSo, in the tens place for 401-488:\n\n- 0:10, 1:10, 2:10, 3:10, 4:10, 5:10, 6:10, 7:10, 8:9.\n\nSo, in the tens place, for the remaining 88 pages, the digit 4 appears 10 times (in 440-449) and the digit 8 appears 9 times (in 480-488). Therefore, in the tens place overall:\n\n- Fours: 40 (from complete hundreds) +10=50\n- Eights: 40 (from complete hundreds) +9=49\n\nWait, but wait, let me confirm that. So, in each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 hundreds give 40 fours. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times in 440-449, so total fours in tens place: 40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the tens place: each complete hundred has 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (from 480-488). So, total eights in tens place: 40+9=49.\n\nSo, so far, in units and tens places, we have:\n\n- Units: 49 fours, 49 eights\n- Tens: 50 fours, 49 eights\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for three-digit page numbers, which start at page 100. So, pages 1-99 have no hundreds digit, pages 100-488 have a hundreds digit.\n\nIn the hundreds place, the digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, since the book goes up to 488. Let's see:\n\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4\n\nSo, how many times does each hundreds digit appear?\n\n- 1: 100 pages (100-199)\n- 2: 100 pages (200-299)\n- 3: 100 pages (300-399)\n- 4: 89 pages (400-488, since 488-400+1=89)\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 pages because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- Digit 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488)\n- Digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the hundreds digit goes up to 4 only.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- Fours: 89\n- Eights: 0\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit across all places.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 488 pages. For units digit, each digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place. So, number of times 4 appears in units place: floor(488/10)=48 full cycles, each contributing 1 four, so 48 fours. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484), making total units fours: 48 +1=49. Similarly, eights: same logic, 48 +1=49. That's correct.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in 4 full hundreds (1-400), each digit 0-9 appears 4*10=40 times in the tens place. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0-8, with 8 appearing 9 times. So, fours in tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) +10 (from 440-449) =50. Eights in tens place: 40 +9=49. That's correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. No eights in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n\nFours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188\n\nEights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for the remaining 88 pages. From 401-488, the tens digits are as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 numbers)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 numbers)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 numbers)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 numbers)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 numbers)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 numbers)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 numbers)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 numbers, but wait, 481-488 is 8 pages, right? Because 488-481=7, so 8 pages, meaning tens digit 8 appears 8 times, not 9.\n\nWait a second, that's a mistake. Earlier, I thought 480-488 is 9 pages, but actually, 480-488 is 9 pages because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9. But in the case of 481-488, that's 8 pages, so tens digit 8 appears 8 times, not 9. Wait, but in the range 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). But 480 is part of 480-488, so the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, in the tens place, digit 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred.\n\nWait, but when I broke it down earlier, I considered 401-488 as starting at 401, so 480-488 is within that range. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, from 480 to 488 inclusive. So, that part is correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 481-488 is 8 pages, but 480 is included in the 480-488 range, which is 9 pages. So, in the tens place, digit 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred. So, in the tens place, eights:40 (from full hundreds) +9=49. That's correct.\n\nSo, going back, the total fours are 188, eights are 98, difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the number of fours and eights separately and see if I get the same result.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about each digit place separately again.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of fours and eights.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- Total numbers:488\n- Each digit 0-9 appears floor(488/10)=48 times, and the remainder is 8. So, for digits 0-9, each appears 48 times in units place, plus an extra 1 for digits 1-8 (since 488 mod 10=8). Wait, no, actually, the remainder is 8, so digits 1-8 get an extra count. Wait, but let me think.\n\nWait, the number of times each digit appears in units place is:\n\n- For each digit d from 0-9, the count is floor((488 + 10 - d)/10). Hmm, maybe that's too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10, which is 48, plus 1 if d <= (488 mod 10). Since 488 mod 10=8, so digits 0-8 get an extra count, and 9 doesn't. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because in the units place, from 1 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8 in the last partial group.\n\nWait, actually, the correct formula is: For units digit d, the count is floor((n + 9 - d)/10). But maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, for units digit, the number of times a digit d appears is equal to the number of complete decades (48) plus 1 if d is less than or equal to the last digit (8). So, for d=4: 48 +1=49. For d=8:48 +1=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for tens digit:\n\nIn the tens place, each digit d from 0-9 appears floor((488 + 10 - d)/100)*10 times, plus an adjustment for the remaining pages.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to consider each hundred block.\n\nFrom 1-400, each digit in tens place appears 40 times (4*10). Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0-8, with 8 appearing 9 times. So, for fours in tens place:40 +10=50. For eights:40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly from 100-488. So, hundreds digit 1:100 times (100-199), 2:100 (200-299), 3:100 (300-399), 4:89 (400-488). So, fours in hundreds place:89, eights:0.\n\nAdding up:\n\nFours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\nEights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place (from 1 to 480).\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - **Total**: 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place for the first 400 pages.\n   - Pages 401-488 add 10 fours (440-449) and 9 eights (480-488).\n   - **Total**: 50 fours, 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - Digits 1, 2, 3 each appear 100 times.\n   - Digit 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - **Total**: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\n**Summing Up**:\n- **Fours**: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **Eights**: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference**: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should separate the counts for each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers go from 1 to 488. So, in each block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. For example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. How many such blocks are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks of 10, and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each full block, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. That would be 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the units digit 4 appears once, and 8 appears once. So, total units place 4's: 48*1 + 1 = 49. Similarly, units place 8's: 48*1 + 1 = 49. Wait, but wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digits in 481-488 are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, yes, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, units place: 49 fours and 49 eights. Now, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place within each 100 numbers. So, in each 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and similarly, 8 appears 10 times. Now, how many full hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 400 pages would be 4 full hundreds (1-400), and then 88 pages beyond that (401-488). So, in the first 400 pages, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? For each hundred, 10 times, so 4 times 10 = 40. Similarly, 8 appears 40 times in the tens place in the first 400 pages. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Let's break this down. Pages 401-409: tens digit is 0. 410-419: tens digit is 1. 420-429: tens digit is 2. 430-439: tens digit is 3. 440-449: tens digit is 4. 450-459: tens digit is 5. 460-469: tens digit is 6. 470-479: tens digit is 7. 480-488: tens digit is 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 440-449, that's 10 pages, so 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488. But wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, right? Because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times in the remaining 88 pages. Therefore, total tens place 4's: 40 (from first 400) + 10 = 50. Tens place 8's: 40 (from first 400) + 9 = 49. So, so far, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 49. Now, let's move to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, which we can ignore. From 100-199, hundreds digit is 1. 200-299: 2. 300-399:3. 400-488:4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 4's are 89, 8's are 0. Now, let's sum up all the digits. For 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =49+49=98. So, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, did I do that right? Let me double-check the counts. Units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8, plus the extra 8 pages where 4 and 8 each appear once. So, 48+1=49 each. That seems correct. Tens place: first 400 pages, 40 each. Then, in the remaining 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, 40+10=50 for 4's, and 40+9=49 for 8's. That seems right. Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 never appears. So, 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's. Adding up: 49+50+89=188 for 4's, and 49+49+0=98 for 8's. The difference is 90. Hmm, that seems correct. I don't think I made a mistake here. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 full blocks (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n   - 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 pages contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - First 400 pages: 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - Remaining 88 pages:\n     - 4's: 10 (from 440-449)\n     - 8's: 9 (from 480-488)\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4's: 89 (from 400-488)\n   - 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit position separately\u2014units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by considering each position one by one.\n\nFirst, let's think about the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once as well. So, for the units place, the number of 4's and 8's should be the same, right? So, maybe the difference comes from the tens and hundreds places.\n\nWait, but maybe not. Let me make sure. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488). In each complete group of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 groups would give 48 4's and 48 8's in the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial group, the units digits include a 4 (484) and an 8 (488). So, that's one more 4 and one more 8. So, total units place: 48 +1 = 49 4's and 48 +1 = 49 8's. So, in units place, both digits appear 49 times each. So, no difference there.\n\nNow, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 10 to 19, the tens digit is 1; from 20 to 29, it's 2, and so on. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So, let's see how many hundreds we have in 488 pages. There are four hundreds: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, 400-488 is not a complete hundred, it's only 88 pages. So, I need to adjust for that.\n\nFirst, let's consider the complete hundreds: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399. Each of these has 100 pages, so in each, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49 in each hundred), and the same for 8 (80-89). So, for each complete hundred, 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. Since there are three complete hundreds, that's 3*10=30 4's and 30 8's.\n\nNow, the last partial hundred is 400-488. Let's see how many tens digits are 4 and 8 here. From 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. Similarly, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 pages, right? Because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9. So, that's 9 8's in the tens place in this last partial hundred.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 30 (from complete hundreds) +10 (from 400-449) =40.\n\nTotal tens place 8's: 30 (from complete hundreds) +9 (from 480-488) =39.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 40 times, and 8's appear 39 times. So, 4's are one more than 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant in three-digit numbers, so from 100 to 488. The hundreds digit can be 1,2,3, or 4. So, let's see how many times each digit appears in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so 100 times. So, 1 appears 100 times, but 4 and 8 don't appear here.\n\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, so 100 times. Again, 4 and 8 don't appear here.\n\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so 100 times. Still, 4 and 8 don't appear.\n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4. How many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 doesn't appear here at all because the hundreds digit can't be 8 in a 488-page book.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the highest page is 488, so the hundreds digit is either 1,2,3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total hundreds place 4's:89, and 8's:0.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's are way more than 8's, specifically 89 more.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each digit position.\n\nFirst, units place: 4's=49, 8's=49.\n\nTens place: 4's=40, 8's=39.\n\nHundreds place:4's=89, 8's=0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+40+89=178.\n\nTotal 8's:49+39+0=88.\n\nSo, the difference is 178 -88=90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems like a big difference. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me go through each digit place again.\n\nUnits place: For each 10 pages, 1 4 and 1 8. So, 488 pages mean 48 full tens (48*10=480) and 8 extra pages (481-488). So, in the units place, 48*1=48 4's, plus one more in 484, so 49. Similarly, 48 8's plus one in 488, so 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each complete hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's. There are three complete hundreds (100-199,200-299,300-399), so 3*10=30 each. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, 30+10=40 for 4's, 30+9=39 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, which occurs 89 times. 8 never appears here. So, 89 4's and 0 8's. That's correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +40 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=178.\n\n8's:49 (units) +39 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=88.\n\nDifference:178-88=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems a lot, but maybe that's correct. Let me see another way. Alternatively, maybe I should count the number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can count how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of 4's: For each 10 pages, one 4. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48. Plus, in the last partial group (481-488), there's a 4 in 484, so +1. Total 49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: Each group of 10 has one 8, so 48, plus in the last group, 488, so +1. Total 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, for 100-399, that's three hundreds, so 3*10=30 each.\n\nNow, for 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8.\n\n- Tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449: 10 times.\n\n- Tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488: 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's:30+10=40.\n\nTotal tens place 8's:30+9=39.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 100-399, hundreds digit is 1,2,3, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, which occurs 89 times (488-400+1=89).\n\nSo, hundreds place 4's:89.\n\nHundreds place 8's:0.\n\nNow, adding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +40 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=178.\n\n8's:49 (units) +39 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=88.\n\nDifference:178-88=90.\n\nHmm, I think that's correct. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can count how many times 4 appears and 8 appears in each position and see if I'm missing anything.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as:\n\nTotal 4's = units_4 + tens_4 + hundreds_4.\n\nSimilarly for 8's.\n\nUnits_4: As calculated, 49.\n\nTens_4:40.\n\nHundreds_4:89.\n\nTotal 4's:178.\n\nUnits_8:49.\n\nTens_8:39.\n\nHundreds_8:0.\n\nTotal 8's:88.\n\nDifference:178-88=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 90 seems like a large number, but given that 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times, which is a significant contribution, it makes sense. So, I think my calculations are correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each group of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10, contributing 48 each.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's: 49, Total 8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - Three complete hundreds (100-399) contribute 30 each.\n   - In 400-488, tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40, Total 8's: 39.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89, Total 8's: 0.\n\nSumming up:\n- Total 4's: 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 178.\n- Total 8's: 49 (units) + 39 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 88.\n\nDifference: 178 - 88 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start with the units place. For the units digit, how often does 4 appear? Well, in every set of ten numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers. Each full set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 fours. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 is in there, which adds another 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49. Now, for the units place 8's. Similarly, in every set of ten, 8 appears once in the units place. So, again, 48 sets of ten give 48 eights. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so that's another 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that's the same as 4's. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. Wait, no, the remaining numbers are 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 8 is included, so that's one more 8 in the units place, making it 48 +1=49. So, both 4's and 8's have 49 in the units place. Now, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, how often does 4 appear? In the tens place, 4 appears in a block of ten numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are up to 488. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers, contributing 10 fours. The next block would be 140-149, another 10 fours. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, that's 5 blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Now, does 488 go beyond 449? Yes, up to 488. But since 440-449 is the last block where the tens digit is 4, after that, the tens digits go to 5, 6, etc., up to 8 in 480-488. So, no additional fours in the tens place beyond the 5 blocks. So, total tens place 4's are 50. Now, for the tens place 8's. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page. So, let's see. The first block is 80-89, that's 10 numbers, contributing 10 eights. Then 180-189, another 10 eights. 280-289, another 10. 380-389, another 10. And then 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 pages: 480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9 eights. So, total tens place 8's are 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. So, tens place 8's are 49. Now, moving on to the hundreds place. For the hundreds digit, 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, for the hundreds place 8's. Since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because 800 would be beyond 488. So, hundreds place 8's are zero. So, total hundreds place 4's are 89, and hundreds place 8's are 0. Now, let's sum up all the 4's and 8's. For 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 4's are 188, total 8's are 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10 (480 numbers) contributing 48 fours, plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 fours, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, contributing 89 fours.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 40 eights, plus 9 more in 480-488, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately and then find the difference between them.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds, because a number can have digits in each place, and each place can contribute to the count of 4's or 8's.\n\nFirst, let's count the 4's in the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so the digit 4 appears once in every 10 numbers. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such numbers are there?\n\nWell, from 1 to 488, how many complete tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete tens and a partial last block of 8 numbers (481-488). In each complete ten, there's one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 times. But wait, does the last partial block (481-488) include a 4 in the units place? Let's see: 484 is within that range, so that's one more 4. So total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there?\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're dealing with page numbers starting from 1, the hundreds digit starts at 0 for pages 1-99, then 1 for 100-199, and so on. So, the tens digit being 4 occurs in the following blocks: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but I should check if the last block, 440-449, is entirely within 488. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, so all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nWait, but I'm only counting 4's in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's here.\n\nSo total 4's would be units + tens + hundreds. That's 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 4's.\n\nNow, let me do the same for 8's.\n\nStarting with the units place again. Every block of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers are there?\n\nFrom 1 to 488, there are 48 complete tens (as before) and a partial last block of 8 numbers (481-488). In each complete ten, one 8, so 48 times. Now, in the last partial block, 481-488, does it include an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488. So that's one more 8. So total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, each of these blocks except the last one (480-488) has 10 numbers. Let me check:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, that's 4 blocks with 10 numbers each, and one block with 9 numbers. So, 4 * 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me verify that. From 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 (since 480 is the 9th number in the block, but wait, no, 480 is the first, 481 is second, up to 488, which is 9 numbers after 480. So yes, 9 numbers. So total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total 8's would be units + tens + hundreds = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again. For the tens place, when I counted 8's, I considered 80-89, which is 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. Similarly for the other blocks. But in the last block, 480-488, the tens digit is 8, right? So, 480 has 8 in tens, 481 has 8 in tens, up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, 9 8's from that block. So, 4 blocks with 10 and one with 9, so 4*10 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nNow, total 4's were 188 and 8's were 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's there. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place of 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 4's occur every 10 numbers, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and then one more in the 484, so 49. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: same as 4's, 49.\n\nTens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: none, since 800+ is beyond 488. So 0.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** Every 10 numbers contribute one 4. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full tens and one partial ten (481-488). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

This is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 48 full tens + 1 in 488 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9).
