    "text": " Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once more in 484. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers in each hundred. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 instances of the digit 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, from 1-488, the hundreds go up to 4 (since 488 is in the 400s). So, there are 5 blocks: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, but actually, each hundred block from 0-99, 100-199, etc., up to 400-488. But in each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers. So, for the first four hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. That's 4 x 10 = 40. Now, for the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 488 is beyond 449, so that's fine. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8, but 4 is still present in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that adds another 10. So total 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but wait, 400-488 is only up to 488, so the tens digit goes up to 8. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, total 4's in the tens place are 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, that's 89 occurrences of the digit 4.\n\nWait, but wait, 400 is the first number where the hundreds digit is 4, and it goes up to 488, which is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus the extra 8 numbers where 484 is included, so 48 + 1 = 49. That seems right.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit still cycles up to 8, so 440-449 is 10 numbers. So, 4 hundreds before 400, each contributing 10, so 4 x 10 = 40, plus 10 in 400-488, total 50. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 89 numbers, so 89. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with units place. Similar to 4's, in every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets and 8 extra numbers. So, 48 times 8 in the units place, plus in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more in 488. So, total 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers in each hundred. For example, 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many full blocks are there? Each hundred has one block of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. In each of the first four hundreds, there's one block of 10 numbers with tens digit 8: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4 x 10 = 40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 occurrences. So, total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, let me make sure. In each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so in each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears exactly once for 10 numbers. So, 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers), 100-199: 180-189 (10), 200-299: 280-289 (10), 300-399: 380-389 (10). That's 4 blocks, each 10 numbers, so 4 x 10 = 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 9 more. So, total 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 0-99: 80-89 (10), 100-199: 180-189 (10), 200-299: 280-289 (10), 300-399: 380-389 (10), and 400-488: 480-488 (9). So, 4 x 10 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, for 4's, I had 188, and for 8's, 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 occurrences. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place, 50 occurrences, and units place 49. So, 89 + 50 + 49 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor the 8's, units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds 0, so 98 total. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can use a formula or a different approach to verify.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFor any digit place, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to N can be calculated using a formula. But since I'm dealing with a specific N (488), maybe it's easier to count manually as I did before.\n\nBut let me try to think differently. For units place, in each block of 10 numbers, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, in 488 numbers, how many full blocks of 10 are there? 48 full blocks (480 numbers), and 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, for 4's in units place: 48 + 1 (since 484 is in the extra 8). Similarly, for 8's in units place: 48 + 1 (since 488 is in the extra 8). Wait, but that would mean both 4 and 8 have 49 in the units place. Wait, but earlier I thought 4's units place was 49 and 8's units place was 49, which matches.\n\nWait, but in my initial count, I thought 8's units place was 49, which is correct because 488 is included. So, that's correct.\n\nFor tens place, in each block of 100 numbers, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 and 8, each appears 10 times per hundred. From 1 to 488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 times for 4 and 8 in the tens place. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred.\n\nSo, total for 4 in tens place: 4 x 10 (from each full hundred) + 10 (from the partial) = 50. For 8 in tens place: 4 x 10 + 9 = 49. That matches my earlier count.\n\nFor hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count or miss any numbers. For example, in the units place, when I counted 48 full tens, that's 480 numbers, and then 8 extra, making 488. So, 48 +1 for 4's in units place, and 48 +1 for 8's in units place. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's, 4 full hundreds contribute 40, plus the last partial hundred contributes 10, so 50. For 8's, 4 full hundreds contribute 40, plus the last partial contributes 9, so 49. That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, only 4 appears 89 times, and 8 never appears. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each set of 10 numbers contributes 1 occurrence of 4.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full sets, plus 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n   - 48 occurrences from full sets + 1 occurrence (484) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n   - 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - In 400-488, 440-449 contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total = 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 400-488 contributes 89 occurrences.\n   - Total = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each set of 10 numbers contributes 1 occurrence of 8.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full sets, plus 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n   - 48 occurrences from full sets + 1 occurrence (488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n   - 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - In 400-488, 480-488 contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total = 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I think this method will help me avoid missing any numbers. I'll go through each place one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in each place.\n\n1. Units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles through 0 to 9. So, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. Now, I need to figure out how many such blocks there are up to 488.\n\nBut wait, 488 isn't a multiple of 10, so I need to adjust for the last partial block. Let me calculate how many complete blocks of 10 there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8). \n\nIn each complete block, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48 blocks give 48 fours. Now, in the partial block from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear here? Yes, at 484. So that's one more 4 in the units place. So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any additional in the last partial decade.\n\nNumber of complete decades: 48 (since 48*10=480). Each contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 fours. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So 4 appears once here, at 484. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, moving on to the tens digit. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, from 101-200, the tens digit is 4 in 140-149, another 10 times, and so on.\n\nSo, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, for the tens digit, each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 fours. But wait, let me check if the last partial hundred affects this.\n\nWait, 488 is less than 500, so the last hundred is 400-488. So, in the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, total tens place 4's: 4*10 + 10 = 50? Wait, no, because from 1-400, it's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10. So total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is part of the fourth hundred, so maybe I'm double-counting? Let me think. Actually, each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, up to 400, there are 4 such blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8, so 440-449 is within 401-488, contributing another 10 fours. So total is 40 +10=50.\n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 in all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nWait, but the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case. So, from 1-99, hundreds digit is 0 (since they're two-digit numbers). From 100-199, hundreds digit is 1, 200-299 is 2, 300-399 is 3, and 400-488 is 4. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +50 +89.\n\nLet me add that up: 49 +50=99, then 99 +89=188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. Units place: Again, for every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so 8 appears once every 10 numbers. Up to 488, how many complete decades are there? 488 /10=48.8, so 48 complete decades and a partial decade of 8 numbers.\n\nIn each complete decade, 8 appears once in the units place, so 48 eights. In the last partial decade (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, total units place eights: 48 +1=49.\n\n2. Tens place: For the tens digit, similar to the 4's. Each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40 eights. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0-8, so the tens digit is 8 in 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 eights in the tens place here. So, total tens eights: 4*10=40 +9=49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. Therefore, hundreds place eights: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98.\n\nSo, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me verify the 4's again:\n\n- Units place: 48 complete decades (1-480) with 48 fours, plus 484 in the last 8 numbers, so 49 fours. Correct.\n- Tens place: Each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40, plus 10 from 440-449, total 50. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 89 numbers from 400-488, so 89 fours. Correct.\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89=188. That seems right.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 complete decades with 48 eights, plus 488, so 49 eights. Correct.\n- Tens place: 4 hundreds give 40 eights, plus from 401-488, 480-488 gives 9 eights, so 49. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct.\nTotal 8's: 49 +49=98. That's correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 eights in the tens place. So, 40 (from 1-400) +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nAnd in the hundreds place, 8 doesn't appear at all, so 0. So, yes, 49+49=98 eights.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90 more fours.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** \n     - For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n     - There are 48 complete decades (1-480), contributing 48 fours.\n     - In the last 8 numbers (481-488), 4 appears once (at 484).\n     - Total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:**\n     - For every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n     - There are 4 complete hundreds (1-400), contributing 4\u00d710=40 fours.\n     - From 401-488, 4 appears 10 times in 440-449.\n     - Total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:**\n     - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers.\n     - Total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Count the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** \n     - Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n     - 48 complete decades contribute 48 eights.\n     - In 481-488, 8 appears once (at 488).\n     - Total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:**\n     - For every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n     - 4 complete hundreds contribute 4\u00d710=40 eights.\n     - From 401-488, 8 appears 9 times in 480-488.\n     - Total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** \n     - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n     - Total hundreds place 8's: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

For each complete set of ten numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once (e.g., 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8 (e.g., 8, 18, 28, etc.). \n\nFirst, I'll figure out how many complete sets of ten there are in 488 pages. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, there are 48 complete sets of ten and an additional 8 pages (481-488). \n\nIn each complete set of ten, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 complete sets, that's 48 times 1 for 4's and 48 times 1 for 8's. So, units place contributes 48 4's and 48 8's so far.\n\nNow, looking at the remaining 8 pages (481-488). The units digits here are 1 through 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, adding that to the units place counts: 48 + 1 = 49 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 8's. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, because the units digit in 481-488 is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place total is 48 (from complete sets) +1=49 4's, and similarly, 48+1=49 8's. Wait, but earlier I thought 48 complete sets, so 48 4's and 48 8's, then adding 1 each for 484 and 488. So, units place: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 1-480, there are 48 sets of ten, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 each. Then, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So, units place: 48 +1=49 4's, and 48 +1=49 8's. So, units place contributes equally to both digits. So, 49 each.\n\nNext, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, ..., 9 for 90-99. Similarly, in 101-200, the tens digit cycles again, and so on.\n\nI need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place from 1 to 488.\n\nFirst, let's break down the number of hundreds in 488. There are four hundreds: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds are 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, no, 488 is in the 400-499 range, but we only go up to 488.\n\nSo, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. For example, in 1-99, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, etc., up to 9 for 90-99. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred.\n\nSo, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see.\n\nFirst, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times: from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, the 480-489 range is only up to 488, so 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times there, not 10. Wait, let me think.\n\nWait, no, in the tens place, for each hundred, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 80-89, which is 10 numbers, but in the last hundred (400-488), the 8 in the tens place would be from 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the last hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, not 10.\n\nSo, let me calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: 4 (since 400 is the start of the fourth hundred, and 488 is within the fourth hundred). Wait, actually, from 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's 5 sets, but the last set is incomplete.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to consider how many hundreds we have. From 1 to 488, the hundreds digits go from 0 (for 1-99) up to 4 (for 400-488). So, that's 5 hundreds, but the last one is only up to 488.\n\nSo, for each hundred except the last, the tens digit 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place.\n\nIn the first four hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each has 10 occurrences of 4 and 8 in the tens place. So, that's 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 times each.\n\nNow, in the last hundred, which is 400-488, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nFor 4 in the tens place: 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place: 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 times.\n\nSo, total for tens place:\n\n4's: 4\u00d710 (from first four hundreds) +10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n\n8's: 4\u00d710 (from first four hundreds) +9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, tens place contributes 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is the third digit from the right. For numbers 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0. From 100-199, it's 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, 89 times.\n\nHow many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, 8 does not appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, hundreds place contributes 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each place.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- Each complete set of ten (1-10, 11-20, etc.) has one 4 and one 8 in the units place. There are 48 complete sets in 480 pages, so 48 each. Then, from 481-488, units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 +1=49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place, except the last hundred where 8 only appears 9 times. So, first four hundreds: 4\u00d710=40 each. Last hundred: 10 for 4, 9 for 8. So, total 50 for 4's and 49 for 8's. That adds up correctly.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488). 8 doesn't appear at all. So, 89 for 4's and 0 for 8's.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98 =90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Breakdown by Digit Positions:**\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Each set of 10 numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) has one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n     - There are 48 complete sets in 480 pages, contributing 48 each.\n     - Pages 481-488 add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n     - Total units place: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each hundred (e.g., 1-100, 100-200) has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place.\n     - First four hundreds (1-399) contribute 40 each.\n     - Pages 400-488 add 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n     - Total tens place: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n     - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n     - Total hundreds place: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\n2. **Total Counts:**\n   - **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such sets are there from 1 to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the extra numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is within this range. So that's one more 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Here, the digit 4 appears in a block of ten numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block contributes 10 instances of the digit 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds. In each hundred, there's one block of ten where the tens digit is 4, so that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 4's. So that's 4*10 = 40. Now, check if there's a partial block beyond 400. From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is a full block, so that's another 10. So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, let me make sure. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 4's). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 blocks, each with 10, so 5*10=50. Wait, earlier I thought 4 full hundreds, but actually, 400-488 is part of the fifth hundred. So yes, 5 blocks, so 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 4's.\n\nWait, let me check: 400 is the first, then 401, ..., up to 488. So 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 99 + 89 is 188? Hmm, 99 + 80 is 179, plus 9 is 188. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So yes, 49 times. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, tens place: 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10, and there are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488: the tens digit is 4 only from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So yes, 5 blocks, each with 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89. So total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So 49 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1=48 +1=49. Yes, correct.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So each full block contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except the last one which contributes 9.\n\nHow many full blocks are there? From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199:180-189 (10). From 200-299:280-289 (10). From 300-399:380-389 (10). From 400-488:480-488 (9). So that's 4 full blocks with 10 each and one partial block with 9. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=40+9=49.\n\nWait, let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So 0.\n\nSo total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98.\n\nWait, let me check units place again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488, which is included. So as before, 49 times. Correct.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 0. So total 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nWait, no, units is 49, tens is 49, so total 49+49=98. Correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. Let me go through each digit place again.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the answer.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's in each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. Similarly, I'll do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once (like 4,14,24,...) and the digit 8 appears once (like 8,18,28,...). Now, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 more pages (481-488). So, in each complete block, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 4's and 48 8's from the units place.\n\nBut wait, I have 8 more pages after 480. Those are 481 to 488. Let me check the units digits here: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in these 8 pages, the units digit is 4 once (484) and 8 once (488). So, adding that, the units place contributes an additional 1 four and 1 eight. So total units digits: 48 +1 =49 fours and 48 +1=49 eights. So, in the units place, both digits appear 49 times each. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every 10 pages. For example, from 1-9, the tens digit is 0, but since we're only considering page numbers starting from 1, maybe I should adjust that. Wait, actually, in page numbers, from 1-9, the tens digit isn't printed, so maybe it's better to think of the tens digit as starting from 10 onwards. So, for the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred. Wait, perhaps a better way is to think in terms of hundreds.\n\nLet me consider the tens place separately. For each hundred (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 ten times each. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place within each hundred.\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? There are four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, actually, 401-488 is only 88 pages, so maybe I need to adjust for that.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate how many times each digit appears in the tens place from 1 to 488.\n\nSo, for the tens digit:\n\n- From 1-99: The tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. But wait, from 1-9, the tens digit is 0, but since we're considering page numbers starting at 1, maybe it's better to think of the tens digit as starting from 10. So, in 1-9, there's no tens digit, so the tens digit count starts at 10.\n\nSo, from 10-99: the tens digit cycles 1-9 each appearing 10 times. So, for each digit in the tens place, from 1 to 9, it appears 10 times in the tens place from 10-99.\n\nThen, from 100-199: The tens digit again cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, from 200-299: same as above.\n\nFrom 300-399: same.\n\nFrom 400-488: The tens digit goes from 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), ..., up to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place here?\n\nFrom 400-409: tens digit 0, 10 times.\n\n410-419: tens digit 1, 10 times.\n\n...\n\n480-488: tens digit 8, 9 times (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488).\n\nWait, no, 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400-409 is 10 pages (400-409), so 10 times for tens digit 0.\n\n410-419: 10 times for 1.\n\nSimilarly, 420-429: 10 times for 2.\n\n430-439: 10 times for 3.\n\n440-449: 10 times for 4.\n\n450-459: 10 times for 5.\n\n460-469: 10 times for 6.\n\n470-479: 10 times for 7.\n\n480-488: 9 times for 8.\n\nSo, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nFrom 1-99: tens digits 1-9 each appear 10 times.\n\nFrom 100-399: each tens digit 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred. So, 100-199: 10 times each, 200-299: 10 times each, 300-399: 10 times each.\n\nFrom 400-488: tens digits 0-8 appear 10 times each except 8, which appears 9 times.\n\nWait, actually, from 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but 8 only goes up to 488, which is 9 pages, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, let's calculate the total number of times 4 appears in the tens place and 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nFirst, 4 in the tens place:\n\nFrom 1-99: 10 times (40-49).\n\nFrom 100-199: 10 times (140-149).\n\nFrom 200-299: 10 times (240-249).\n\nFrom 300-399: 10 times (340-349).\n\nFrom 400-488: 10 times (440-449).\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 10 (from 1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) +10 (300-399) +10 (400-488) = 50 times.\n\nWait, but wait, from 400-488, 440-449 is 10 pages, so that's correct.\n\nNow, 8 in the tens place:\n\nFrom 1-99: 10 times (80-89).\n\nFrom 100-199: 10 times (180-189).\n\nFrom 200-299: 10 times (280-289).\n\nFrom 300-399: 10 times (380-389).\n\nFrom 400-488: 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 4 appears 50 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nSo, the difference in tens place is 50 - 49 = 1 more four than eight.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. From 400-488, the tens digit 8 is only in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, yes, 49 times total for 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo, so far, in the tens place, 4's are 50, 8's are 49. So, 4's are 1 more.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, the digits go from 1-4, since the book has 488 pages.\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, but since we're only considering page numbers, maybe it's better to say that the hundreds digit doesn't appear until page 100.\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, appearing 100 times.\n\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, appearing 100 times.\n\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, appearing 100 times.\n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times (since 400-488 is 89 pages: 488 - 400 +1 = 89).\n\nWait, 488 - 400 is 88, so +1 is 89 pages.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488).\n\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4, and before that, it's 1,2,3.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, the difference in hundreds place is 89 - 0 = 89 more fours than eights.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each digit place.\n\nUnits place: 49 fours, 49 eights \u2192 difference 0.\n\nTens place: 50 fours, 49 eights \u2192 difference +1.\n\nHundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights \u2192 difference +89.\n\nTotal difference: 0 +1 +89 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, how many times does 4 appear? It's 89 times, correct, because each page from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, which is 89 pages.\n\nNow, in the tens place, I had 50 fours and 49 eights, so that's a difference of +1.\n\nIn the units place, both digits appear 49 times, so no difference.\n\nSo, total difference is 89 (hundreds) +1 (tens) =90.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. I thought that in each block of 10, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place, and there are 48 full blocks, plus 8 extra pages (481-488), which include 484 and 488, so adding one more 4 and one more 8. So, 48 +1=49 fours and 48 +1=49 eights. So, units place difference is 0.\n\nTens place: 50 fours and 49 eights, so +1.\n\nHundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights, so +89.\n\nTotal: 89 +1=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the hundreds place correctly calculated? From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the tens place. Let me recount the number of times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nFrom 1-99:\n\n- 4 appears in the tens place from 40-49: 10 times.\n\n- 8 appears in the tens place from 80-89: 10 times.\n\nFrom 100-199:\n\n- 4 appears in 140-149: 10 times.\n\n- 8 appears in 180-189: 10 times.\n\nFrom 200-299:\n\n- 4 appears in 240-249: 10 times.\n\n- 8 appears in 280-289: 10 times.\n\nFrom 300-399:\n\n- 4 appears in 340-349: 10 times.\n\n- 8 appears in 380-389: 10 times.\n\nFrom 400-488:\n\n- 4 appears in 440-449: 10 times.\n\n- 8 appears in 480-488: 9 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\nFor 4 in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +10 =50.\n\nFor 8 in tens place:10 +10 +10 +10 +9=49.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nNumber of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the units place correctly. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIn each block of 10, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once here, making total 48 +1=49 fours in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears once in each block of 10, so 48 times, plus once in the remaining 8 pages (488), so 48 +1=49 eights in the units place.\n\nSo, units place: 49 each, no difference.\n\nTens place: 50 fours, 49 eights.\n\nHundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal eights:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all the hundreds correctly. From 1-99, hundreds digit is 0, so no fours or eights there. From 100-199, hundreds digit is 1, so no fours or eights. From 200-299, hundreds digit is 2, so no fours or eights. From 300-399, hundreds digit is 3, so no fours or eights. From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, so that's where the 89 fours come from.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to calculate the number of fours and eights is to count each digit position separately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nFor each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated as:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(N/10).\n\nEach group contributes one occurrence of each digit.\n\nThen, the remaining pages: N mod 10.\n\nIf the remaining pages are >= d, then add one more occurrence.\n\nSo, for 4 in units place:\n\nN=488.\n\nNumber of complete groups:488//10=48.\n\nRemaining pages:488%10=8.\n\nSince 8 >=4, add 1.\n\nTotal fours in units place:48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in units place:\n\nNumber of complete groups:48.\n\nRemaining pages:8.\n\nSince 8 >=8, add 1.\n\nTotal eights in units place:48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to N can be calculated as:\n\nEach hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: N//100.\n\nEach complete hundred contributes 10 times each digit.\n\nThen, the remaining part: N%100.\n\nIn the remaining part, the tens digit can be calculated as:\n\nIf the remaining part >=10*(d+1), then add 10.\n\nElse, if remaining part >=10*d, add (remaining part -10*d +1).\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of how many times each digit appears in the tens place.\n\nFor 4 in the tens place:\n\nFrom 1-99: 10 times (40-49).\n\nFrom 100-199:10 times (140-149).\n\nFrom 200-299:10 times (240-249).\n\nFrom 300-399:10 times (340-349).\n\nFrom 400-488:10 times (440-449).\n\nSo, total 5*10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place:\n\nFrom 1-99:10 times (80-89).\n\nFrom 100-199:10 times (180-189).\n\nFrom 200-299:10 times (280-289).\n\nFrom 300-399:10 times (380-389).\n\nFrom 400-488:9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, total 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4 in hundreds place:\n\nOnly from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nFor 8 in hundreds place: never, since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, total fours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete blocks of 10 in 488 pages: 48.\n   - Remaining pages: 8 (481-488).\n   - '4' appears once in units place in each block: 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n   - '8' appears once in units place in each block: 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n   - Difference in units place: 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred.\n   - From 1-99: '4' appears 10 times (40-49); '8' appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - From 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: Each contributes 10 times for both '4' and '8' in the tens place.\n   - From 400-488: '4' appears 10 times (440-449); '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total '4's in tens place: 10 (1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 50.\n   - Total '8's in tens place: 10 (1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 49.\n   - Difference in tens place: 50 - 49 = 1.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - '4' appears in the hundreds place from 400-488: 89 times.\n   - '8' never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Difference in hundreds place: 89 - 0 = 89.\n\n4. **Total Difference:**\n   - Units: 0\n   - Tens: +1\n   - Hundreds: +89\n   - Total: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). In each complete block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the digit 8 appears once as well (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). So, for 48 blocks, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the same for 8's. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. So, the difference in units place is 49 - 49 = 0.\n\nMoving on to the tens place:\n\nThe tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 488 pages, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each hundred block, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 4's and 40 8's. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-488). So, the tens digit 4 appears once in 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 occurrences. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears once in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 occurrences (480-488). Wait, no, actually, the tens digit 8 in 401-488 is only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 (from the hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. 8's in tens place: 40 (from the hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49. So, the difference in tens place is 50 - 49 = 1.\n\nNow, the hundreds place:\n\nThe hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case. For pages 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's there. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's. From 200-299, hundreds digit is 2, same thing. From 300-399, hundreds digit is 3. From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is never 8. So, 4's in hundreds place: 89. 8's in hundreds place: 0. Difference here is 89 - 0 = 89.\n\nNow, let's add up the differences from each place:\n\nUnits place: 0\n\nTens place: 1\n\nHundreds place: 89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nStarting again with units place:\n\nEach block of 10 has one 4 and one 8 in the units. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place difference is 0. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place. 4 hundreds, so 40 each. Then, from 401-488, which is 88 pages. The tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. Difference is 1. That seems right.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's. 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0. Difference is 89.\n\nAdding up the differences: 0 (units) +1 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the hundreds place correct? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 pages. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nIs there any other place where 4 or 8 might appear? I think we've covered units, tens, and hundreds. So, I think the total difference is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can count the total number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49\n\nTens place: 50\n\nHundreds place: 89\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49\n\nTens place: 49\n\nHundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I'll calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of ten numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the digit 4 appears once every ten numbers, and the same goes for 8. \n\nNow, how many groups of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times (once in each group of ten) plus one more time in the 480s (since 484 would have a 4 in the units place). Wait, actually, 481-488 is the 48th group plus 8 more. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times plus 1 (from 484), totaling 49 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 48 times plus one more time in the 480s (488), so that's 49 times as well. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so the units digit 8 would only appear once in the 480s, so maybe I should check that again.\n\nWait, no, let me think again. From 1 to 480, there are 48 groups of ten. Each group contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so that's 48 each. Then, from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers, the units digits are 1 through 8. So, in this range, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, in total, units place: 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, units place contributes equally to both 4 and 8, 49 each.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89). \n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, no, 401-488 is part of the 400s. So, from 1-400, there are four complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Then, from 401-488, that's 88 pages, so the tens digit in this range goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). \n\nSo, in each of the first four hundreds (1-400), the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), same for 8. So, that's 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place up to page 400. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Let's see, 440-449 would be the range where the tens digit is 4, but wait, 401-488 is only up to 488, so 440-449 is within this range. That's 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), so the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here. \n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place from 480-488. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times (from 440-449) and the digit 8 appears 9 times (from 480-488). Therefore, in the tens place, the total for 4 is 40 (from 1-400) + 10 = 50 times, and for 8, it's 40 (from 1-400) + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 times for both 4 and 8 in the tens place, so 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 each. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, so 40 + 10 = 50 for 4. For 8, in the tens place from 401-488, it's 480-488, which is 9 times (since 488 is included), so 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; 400-488, it's 4. \n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. How about 8? Well, from 800-899, the hundreds digit would be 8, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal for 8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check these calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n- From 1-480: 48 groups of ten, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48 each.\n- From 481-488: units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- From 1-400: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times for 4 and 8 in the tens place, so 40 each.\n- From 401-488: tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, so 40 + 10 = 50 for 4.\n- Tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times (480,481,...,488), so 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488).\n- 8 appears 0 times because the book ends at 488, which is less than 800. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n- 4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't double-count or miss anything.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to consider each digit place separately and calculate the occurrences of 4 and 8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the tens place for 4. Let me recount the tens place for 4. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 times, so 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 more, making it 50. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place: from 1-400, 40 times. From 401-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 more, totaling 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, that's 48 times. Now, for the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. The digit 4 appears once here as well (484). So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for every 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many such groups are there? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds. In each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (from 40-49). So, that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, but wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, from 400-409, the tens digit is 0, and from 410-419, it's 1, etc. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, actually, in the hundreds place, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can be from 0 to 9. But in the last partial hundred, 400-488, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8, so the digit 4 in the tens place occurs once for 440-449. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, when considering the tens place, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 ten times. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 in the tens place occurs 10 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). Since there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributes 10 occurrences. So that's 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial hundred, which is 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 488 is less than 499, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488. So, that's another 10 occurrences. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 400-488 is 89 numbers, but when considering the tens place, it's 400-488, so the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, the digit 4 in the tens place occurs when the tens digit is 4, which is 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. Therefore, total tens place 4's are 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many times does 4 appear here? Well, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, but the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them. So, that's 89 occurrences. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 occurrences.\n\nWait, but wait, let me confirm. The hundreds digit is 4 for page numbers 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, it's 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 occurrences.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, when the hundreds digit is 4, it's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. But when counting the tens and units places, I have to make sure I'm not double-counting. Wait, no, because each digit is considered separately. So, units, tens, and hundreds are separate digit places, so adding them up is correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: units place 4's: 49, tens place 4's: 50, hundreds place 4's: 89. So total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then, the last partial group is 481-488, which has 8 numbers. The units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once here as well (488). So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for every 100 numbers, specifically in 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). In each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89). So, 4*10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. Therefore, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: from 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place in the last partial hundred. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, the hundreds place 8's are zero.\n\nTherefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to make off-by-one errors.\n\nLet me recount the number of 4's:\n\n- Units place: For every 10 numbers, one 4. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the last 8 numbers (481-488) include 484, which is another 4 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\n- Tens place: For every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, in each hundred, 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Now, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\n- Units place: Same as 4's, 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Last 8 numbers include 488, which is another 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: In each full hundred, 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40. In the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: No page numbers in 800s, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them. So, 89 occurrences. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the total number of 4's and 8's another way. Maybe by using a formula or a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n can be calculated using a method where you consider each digit place separately, as I did.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write a small program or use a formula to calculate it, but since I'm doing it manually, I'll stick to my previous method.\n\nWait, another way to check: For each digit place, units, tens, hundreds, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) + (if the last digit is >=4, add 1). Wait, no, more accurately, for units digit, the number of times 4 appears is (n // 10) + min(1, max(0, n % 10 - 4 + 1)). Wait, maybe that's overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, for units digit, the number of times 4 appears is (488 // 10) + 1 if the last digit is >=4. Wait, 488 // 10 is 48, and since 8 >=4, we add 1, so 49. That matches.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: (488 // 10) + 1 if last digit >=8. 488//10=48, and last digit is 8, so add 1, total 49.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: For each hundred, 10 times. So, 488 // 100 = 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. In the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 +9=49.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: 488 >=400, so the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nNumber of 8's: 488 <800, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by separating the problem into single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit page numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit pages, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits 4 and 8 each appear exactly once. So, for single-digit pages, both 4 and 8 occur once.\n\nNext, I'll look at the two-digit pages, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I can count the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each place separately.\n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers:\n- The digit 4 appears in the tens place for pages 40 to 49. That's 10 pages, so 10 times.\n- The digit 8 appears in the tens place for pages 80 to 89. That's another 10 pages, so 10 times.\n\nFor the units place in two-digit numbers:\n- The digit 4 appears once every 10 pages, so from 10 to 99, that's 9 times (4, 14, 24, ..., 94). Wait, actually, from 10 to 99, the units digit cycles every 10, so it's 9 times for each digit from 0 to 9. Wait, no, actually, from 10 to 99, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 9 times in the units place. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. From 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers. Each units digit (0-9) appears 9 times in the units place because 90/10=9. So, for the units place, both 4 and 8 each appear 9 times.\n\nSo, for two-digit pages:\n- 4's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times\n- 8's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times\n\nWait, but wait, when I'm counting units digits, I think I might be making a mistake. Let me recount. From 10 to 99, the units digit cycles 0-9 nine times, right? Because 90 numbers divided by 10 digits gives 9 cycles. So each digit, including 4 and 8, appears 9 times in the units place. So yes, 9 times each.\n\nSo, for two-digit pages, 4's: 10 + 9 = 19, and 8's: 10 + 9 = 19. So, same number of 4's and 8's in two-digit pages.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit pages, which are from 100 to 488. These have hundreds, tens, and units places. I need to count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place.\n\nLet's break it down by each digit place.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place:\n- The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, pages 100-199 have 1 in the hundreds place, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place:\n- How many times does 4 appear? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n- How about 8? Since the hundreds digit only goes up to 4, 8 never appears in the hundreds place here. So, 0 times.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers (100-488):\n- The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each hundred. So, for each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit goes through 0-9 ten times each, except maybe the last block, 400-488, which might not complete the full cycle.\n\nWait, let's think carefully. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 for each ten pages. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.), and similarly for 8.\n\nBut in the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, let's break it down:\n\nFor hundreds 100-399:\n- Each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, 340-349).\n- Similarly, each hundred has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).\n- There are 3 hundreds here (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), so 3 * 10 = 30 for each digit.\n\nNow, for the hundreds 400-488:\n- The tens digit goes from 0 to 8, so 400-488 is 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n- The tens digit cycles 0-8, so how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Let's see, 440-449 is one set, which is 10 pages. But since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is fully included because 449 < 488. So, 10 times for 4 in the tens place.\n- Similarly, 8 in the tens place would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, only 480-488 are included. That's 9 pages (from 480 to 488 inclusive). So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n\nSo, for the tens place in 400-488:\n- 4 appears 10 times\n- 8 appears 9 times\n\nTherefore, total in tens place:\n- 4's: 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 40\n- 8's: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me double-check. From 100-399, each hundred contributes 10 for each digit, so 3 * 10 = 30. Then, in 400-488, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times. So yes, 40 and 39 respectively.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers (100-488):\n- The units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten pages. So, for each hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the units place. But again, we have to check the last partial hundred, 400-488.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\nFor hundreds 100-399:\n- Each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 in the units place per ten pages, so 10 per hundred. Since there are 3 hundreds, 3 * 10 = 30 for 4.\n- Similarly, 8 appears 10 times per hundred, so 3 * 10 = 30 for 8.\n\nFor hundreds 400-488:\n- The units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten, but since we're only going up to 488, we need to see how many complete tens we have. From 400-488, that's 89 pages. Each ten has 10 units digits, so 8 full tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-489), but since we stop at 488, the last ten is incomplete. Wait, actually, 400-488 is 89 pages, which is 8 full tens (400-409 is 10, 410-419 is another 10, etc., up to 480-489, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 pages. Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So, how many complete tens are there?\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 pages. Let's see: 400-409 is 10 pages, 410-419 is another 10, up to 480-489, but since we're stopping at 488, the last ten is 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, how many complete tens? From 400-480, that's 81 pages, which is 8 full tens (each 10 pages), and then 480-488 is 9 pages. So, in the units place, for each complete ten, each digit appears once. So, in the units place for 400-488:\n\n- For digits 0-9, each appears 8 times in the complete tens (400-480), and then in the last 9 pages (480-488), each digit from 0-8 appears once, and 9 doesn't because 489 is beyond 488.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the units place, for each ten, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, in 400-409, units digits are 0-9; same for 410-419, etc. So, in 400-488, how many times does each digit appear in the units place?\n\nLet me think differently. The total number of units digits from 400-488 is 89 pages. Each digit from 0-9 appears floor(89/10) = 8 times, and then the remainder is 9, so digits 0-8 appear one more time. So, each digit from 0-8 appears 9 times, and 9 appears 8 times.\n\nWait, that might not be correct. Let me check with an example. From 400-409: units digits 0-9, each once. Then 410-419: same, etc. So, up to 480-489, which is 9 pages (480-488), so units digits 0-8.\n\nSo, for each digit:\n\n- For digits 0-8: they appear once in each of the 9 tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-489). But wait, 480-489 is only 9 pages, so digits 0-8 appear once, and 9 doesn't appear. So, how many times does each digit appear in the units place from 400-488?\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in the units place:\n\n- For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each digit 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the units place, as each ten has one occurrence per digit.\n\n- For 400-488, the units digits go from 0-8 in the incomplete last ten. So, how many times does each digit appear?\n\nWait, let's think of it as:\n\n- From 400-488, which is 89 pages. The units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, 8 full tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-489), but 480-489 is only 9 pages because we stop at 488. So, in each of the 8 full tens, each digit 0-9 appears once. In the last partial ten (480-488), digits 0-8 appear once.\n\nSo, total for units place in 400-488:\n\n- Digits 0-8: 8 (from full tens) + 1 (from partial ten) = 9 times each.\n- Digit 9: 8 times (only in full tens).\n\nSo, for the units place in 400-488:\n- 4 appears 9 times\n- 8 appears 9 times\n\nWait, but wait, I'm only considering 4 and 8. So, for the units place in 400-488:\n- 4: 9 times\n- 8: 9 times\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that in the units place for 400-488, 4 and 8 each appear 9 times. So, combining this with the earlier hundreds and tens places.\n\nWait, no, actually, the units place in 400-488 is 89 pages. Each digit 0-9 appears floor(89/10) = 8 times, and then the remainder is 9, so digits 0-8 appear one more time. So, each digit from 0-8 appears 9 times, and 9 appears 8 times. So yes, both 4 and 8 appear 9 times in the units place in 400-488.\n\nTherefore, for the units place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39\n- 8's: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39\n\nWait, but wait, in 100-399, each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the units place, so 3 * 10 = 30 for each digit. Then, in 400-488, each digit 0-8 appears 9 times, so 4 and 8 each get 9 more. So, yes, 30 + 9 = 39 for both 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit confusing. Let me confirm:\n\n- For 100-399:\n  - Each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 in units place, so 3 * 10 = 30\n  - Similarly, 30 for 8\n\n- For 400-488:\n  - 4 appears 9 times in units place\n  - 8 appears 9 times in units place\n\nSo, total units place:\n- 4: 30 + 9 = 39\n- 8: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nNow, let me sum up all the occurrences of 4 and 8 in the three-digit pages (100-488):\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4: 89\n  - 8: 0\n\n- Tens place:\n  - 4: 40\n  - 8: 39\n\n- Units place:\n  - 4: 39\n  - 8: 39\n\nSo, total for three-digit pages:\n- 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n- 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check the calculations again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place for three-digit pages, 4 appears 89 times, which is correct because pages 400-488 are 89 pages, each with 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place:\n- 4's: 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 40\n- 8's: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39\n\nIn the units place:\n- 4's: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39\n- 8's: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39\n\nSo, adding up:\n- 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n- 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit pages.\n\nSingle-digit (1-9):\n- 4: 1\n- 8: 1\n\nTwo-digit (10-99):\n- 4: 19\n- 8: 19\n\nThree-digit (100-488):\n- 4: 168\n- 8: 78\n\nTotal:\n- 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n- 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, total 4's printed are 188, and total 8's are 98. Therefore, the number of 4's printed more than 8's is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me recount the three-digit pages:\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4 appears 89 times (pages 400-488)\n  - 8 appears 0 times\n\n- Tens place:\n  - 4 appears 10 times in 400-488 (440-449)\n  - 4 appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds (100-399), so 3*10=30\n  - Total for 4: 30 + 10 = 40\n  - 8 appears 9 times in 400-488 (480-488)\n  - 8 appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds, so 3*10=30\n  - Total for 8: 30 + 9 = 39\n\n- Units place:\n  - 4 appears 9 times in 400-488 (as per the units digit cycling)\n  - 4 appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds, so 3*10=30\n  - Total for 4: 30 + 9 = 39\n  - Similarly, 8 appears 9 times in 400-488 and 30 in the first three hundreds, so 30 + 9 = 39\n\nSo, adding up:\n- 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n- 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nNow, adding single and two-digit pages:\n- 4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188\n- 8's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but let me check the two-digit pages again. Earlier, I thought that in two-digit pages, both 4 and 8 appeared 19 times each. Let me confirm that.\n\nTwo-digit pages (10-99):\n- Tens place:\n  - 4: 10 times (40-49)\n  - 8: 10 times (80-89)\n\n- Units place:\n  - 4: 9 times (14, 24, ..., 94)\n  - 8: 9 times (18, 28, ..., 98)\n\nSo, total for 4: 10 + 9 = 19\nTotal for 8: 10 + 9 = 19\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, single-digit pages:\n- 4: once (page 4)\n- 8: once (page 8)\n\nSo, adding up, yes, 1 + 19 + 168 = 188 for 4's, and 1 + 19 + 78 = 98 for 8's.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the units place in three-digit numbers. Let me think again. From 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, in each ten, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. How many tens are there?\n\nFrom 400-488, that's 89 pages. Each ten is 10 pages, so 8 full tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-489). But since we stop at 488, the last ten is 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, in each full ten, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, for each full ten, that's 8 tens, so 8 times each for 4 and 8. Then, in the last partial ten, 480-488, the units digits go from 0-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So, total for 4 and 8 in units place in 400-488 is 8 + 1 = 9 each. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, I think my calculations are correct, and the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places across all page numbers.\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once.\n   - 8 appears once.\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units place:** Each digit appears 9 times (14, 24, ..., 94 for 4; 18, 28, ..., 98 for 8).\n   - Total for two-digit pages: 4's = 19, 8's = 19.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 does not appear.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times in 400-488 and 30 times in 100-399, totaling 40. 8 appears 9 times in 400-488 and 30 times in 100-399, totaling 39.\n   - **Units place:** Each digit appears 9 times in 400-488 and 30 times in 100-399, totaling 39 for both 4 and 8.\n   - Total for three-digit pages: 4's = 168, 8's = 78.\n\n**Total occurrences:**\n- 4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n- 8's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, subtract the count of 8's from the count of 4's to get the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I think this method will help me avoid missing any numbers and will make it easier to calculate the total occurrences of each digit.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in each place.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - For every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484.\n   - How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, there are 48 full blocks, and then a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488).\n   - Each full block contributes 1 occurrence of 4 in the units place, so 48 occurrences.\n   - Now, in the partial block (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once here (484).\n   - So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - For every block of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449.\n   - How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401-488.\n   - Each full block contributes 10 occurrences, so 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Now, the partial block from 401-488: the tens digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., up to 8 for 481-490. But since we're only going up to 488, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is a full 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 occurrences.\n   - Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's 10 more. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 occurrences of the digit 4.\n\nNext, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, in every block of 10, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full blocks of 10 are there? 48 full blocks (1-480), and then 8 numbers (481-488).\n   - Each full block contributes 1 occurrence, so 48.\n   - In the partial block, units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - For every block of 100, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place, like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - There are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 4\u00d710=40.\n   - Now, the partial block 401-488: the tens digit cycles as before. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n   - So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full blocks \u00d71 =48, plus 1 in 484, total 49.\n- Tens: 4 blocks \u00d710=40, plus 10 in 440-449, total 50.\n- Hundreds: 89 numbers from 400-488, so 89.\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full blocks \u00d71=48, plus 1 in 488, total 49.\n- Tens: 4 blocks \u00d710=40, plus 9 in 480-488, total 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full blocks of 10 (48 occurrences) + 1 in 484 = 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 blocks of 100 (40 occurrences) + 10 in 440-449 = 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 numbers (400-488) = 89.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full blocks of 10 (48 occurrences) + 1 in 488 = 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 blocks of 100 (40 occurrences) + 9 in 480-488 = 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1-0, so 4 appears once (at 4) and 8 appears once (at 8). This pattern repeats every 10 numbers. Now, I need to figure out how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488 pages. \n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488). In each complete group, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, for units place, 4 appears 48 times, and 8 appears 48 times. But wait, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units place: 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, in units place, they are equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in each 100-number block, and similarly, 8 appears 10 times.\n\nHow many complete 100-number blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete block, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4 blocks give 4 * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, 8 appears 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, in the partial block from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., up to 8 for 481-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place in 440-449, which is 10 pages. Wait, but in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in the partial block. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, so in 480-488, that's 9 pages where the tens digit is 8. But wait, 480 is included in the partial block, so from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the partial block.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear? Each tens digit appears 10 times, except for the last one, which might be less. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the tens digit 8 in the 480-488 range is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, in the partial block, 4 adds 10, and 8 adds 9.\n\nSo, total tens place: 4 appears 40 (from complete blocks) + 10 (from partial) = 50 times. 8 appears 40 + 9 = 49 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present in page numbers from 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, but we don't count that. From 100-488, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nSo, let's count how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488. That's 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, from 1-488, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) contribute one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, 48 +1 =49 for both, correct.\n\nTens place: 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's. So, 4*10=40 each. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 440-449 (10 times) and 8 for 480-488 (9 times). So, 40 +10=50 for 4's, and 40 +9=49 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's.\n\nAdding up: 4's total is 49+50+89=188. 8's total is 49+49+0=98. Difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused about the hundreds place. Let me check again. From 400-488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 +1 =89. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAnother thing to check: in the tens place, when I was counting 4's in the partial block, I said 440-449 is 10 numbers. That's correct. And for 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 9 times. So, 4's have 10 more in the tens place, making the total 50 vs 49.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Complete groups: 488 / 10 = 48 groups, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 and 8.\n   - Remaining pages (481-488): 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total: 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete hundreds: 4 groups (1-400), each contributing 10 occurrences of 4 and 8.\n   - Partial hundred (401-488): 4 appears 10 times (440-449), 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, for the units place:\n\n- For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in each block of 10 numbers. So, in every 10 pages, each digit appears once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, 4 appears once and 8 appears once.\n\nBut wait, the book ends at 488, which is a three-digit number, so I need to check how many complete blocks of 10 there are and whether there's a partial block at the end.\n\nLet me calculate the number of complete tens in 488 pages. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete tens and an extra 8 pages. So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times. But wait, that might not be entirely accurate because the last block is only 8 pages (481-488), so the units digits go from 1 to 8, meaning digits 9 and 0 don't appear in the units place in the last partial block.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate how many times each digit appears in each position by considering the number of times each digit appears in each place across all page numbers.\n\nLet me structure this by each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor units digit:\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated as:\n\n- If N is a three-digit number, say ABC (where A, B, C are digits), then the number of times d appears in the units place is:\n\n= (number of complete hundreds) * 10^1 + (number of complete tens in the current hundred) * 1 + (if the units digit is >= d, add 1 else 0)\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to break it down as follows:\n\nThe units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each complete set of 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place.\n\nSo, for 488 pages, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete sets and a partial set of 8 numbers.\n\nIn each complete set, 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once.\n\nSo, for the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's = 48 (from complete sets) + check the partial set.\n\nThe partial set is the last 8 numbers: 481-488. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once and 8 appears once in the units place of the partial set.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 488 is included, so the last page is 488, which is the 8th number in the partial set, so units digits go up to 8. So, yes, 4 and 8 each appear once in the partial set.\n\nSo, units place: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place:\n\nThe tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred block.\n\nSo, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each hundred block contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place.\n\nSo, for each hundred block, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\nSo, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, the remaining pages are from 401-488, which is 88 pages. Wait, no, 401-488 is actually 88 pages (since 488 - 400 = 88). Wait, no, 401 to 488 is 88 pages (including both 401 and 488). So, the tens digit in this block (401-488) is from 0 to 8.\n\nWait, let me correct that. The tens digit in 401-488:\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit is 0.\n\n411-420: tens digit is 1.\n\n421-430: tens digit is 2.\n\n431-440: tens digit is 3.\n\n441-450: tens digit is 4.\n\n451-460: tens digit is 5.\n\n461-470: tens digit is 6.\n\n471-480: tens digit is 7.\n\n481-488: tens digit is 8.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so from 481-488, the tens digit is 8, but how many numbers are there? From 481 to 488, that's 8 numbers: 481,482,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 8 times here.\n\nWait, but let me check: for each tens digit in the 401-488 block, how many times does each digit appear.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to calculate how many times each digit appears in the tens place in the incomplete hundred block.\n\nThe incomplete hundred block is from 401 to 488, which is 88 numbers.\n\nEach tens digit in this block repeats 10 times except possibly the last one if it's incomplete.\n\nWait, 401-488: the tens digits go from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 481-488). Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times, except the last one, which appears only 8 times because 488 is the last page.\n\nSo, for the tens digit in the incomplete hundred block:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 10 times (401-410)\n- Tens digit 1: 10 times (411-420)\n- Tens digit 2: 10 times (421-430)\n- Tens digit 3: 10 times (431-440)\n- Tens digit 4: 10 times (441-450)\n- Tens digit 5: 10 times (451-460)\n- Tens digit 6: 10 times (461-470)\n- Tens digit 7: 10 times (471-480)\n- Tens digit 8: 8 times (481-488)\n\nSo, in the tens place in the incomplete block:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times (from 441-450)\n- 8 appears 8 times (from 481-488)\n\nTherefore, total in the tens place:\n\n- 4's: 4 complete hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 from the incomplete block, total 50.\n- 8's: 4 complete hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 8 from the incomplete block, total 48.\n\nWait, but wait, in the incomplete block, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times, so 8's in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nSimilarly, 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Each complete hundred contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place. So, 4 complete hundreds give 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, yes, 50 for 4's and 48 for 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place:\n\nThe hundreds digit is only present in three-digit numbers, from 100-999. Since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nEach hundreds digit appears for 100 numbers. For example, 100-199 have hundreds digit 1, 200-299 have 2, etc.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n\nHow many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, because 800 is beyond 488. So, 8 does not appear in the hundreds place at all.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488)\n- 8 appears 0 times\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's:\n\n188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nEach complete set of 10 has one 4 and one 8. There are 48 complete sets (since 488 / 10 = 48.8), so 48*1=48 for each. Then, the partial set from 481-488 has units digits 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So, units place: 48 +1=49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach complete hundred contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place. So, 4 complete hundreds give 40 for each digit. Then, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, 4's: 40 +10=50, 8's:40 +8=48. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 doesn't appear at all. So, 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =97\n\nDifference:188 -97=91\n\nWait, but I feel like that might be correct, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly.\n\nFrom 400-488, how many numbers is that? 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nAnother way to check: total number of digits printed.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can cross-verify by calculating the total number of digits used. But maybe that's overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that in each position, the counts are correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about the hundreds place: in 1-99, there's no hundreds digit, so 0. From 100-488, the hundreds digit is 1,2,3,4. Each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) contributes 100, 100, 100, and 89 numbers respectively. So, for 4, it's 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, the incomplete hundred block (401-488) has tens digits up to 8, with the last one being only 8 numbers, so 8 appears 8 times there.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo, I think the calculation is correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Determine the Range:**\n   - The book has pages numbered from 1 to 488.\n\n2. **Count Digit Occurrences in Each Position:**\n   - We'll examine the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n3. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 sets.\n   - Each digit appears 48 times in the units place.\n   - Partial set (481-488): digits 1-8 appear once each.\n   - **4's:** 48 +1 =49\n   - **8's:**48 +1=49\n\n4. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - Complete hundreds (1-400): 4 sets, contributing 40 times each.\n   - Incomplete hundred (401-488):\n     - Tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450).\n     - Tens digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - **4's:**40 +10=50\n   - **8's:**40 +8=48\n\n5. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Only present from 100-999, but our book stops at 488.\n   - Hundreds digit 4 appears from 400-488: 89 times.\n   - Hundreds digit 8 doesn't appear.\n   - **4's:**89\n   - **8's:**0\n\n6. **Total Counts:**\n   - **4's:**49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188\n   - **8's:**49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =97\n\n7. **Calculate Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) -97 (8's) =91\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears once (at 4). In 11-20, it appears once (at 14), and so on. Now, how many such sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 full sets and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full set, the 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 in the tens place appears in a block of 10 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, this happens every 100 numbers. So, in 1-100, there are 10 4's in the tens place (40-49). Then, in 101-200, another 10 (140-149), and so on. Let's see how many hundreds we have. 488 is less than 500, so we have 4 full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, that's actually 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred from 401-488. In each complete hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so that's 4 times 10, which is 40. Now, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 440-449. That's another 10 numbers, so adding 10 more, making it 50 in total for the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 in the hundreds place appears in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, but since we're only considering the hundreds digit, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Wait, but actually, 488 is the last page, so 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I made a mistake here. Because when I'm considering the hundreds place, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, adding that up: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's printed are 187.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in every set of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-10, 8 appears once (at 8). From 11-20, once at 18, and so on. So, how many full sets of 10 are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 in the tens place appears in blocks of 10 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except maybe the last one. Let's see: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, in each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), there are 10 8's in the tens place, so that's 4 times 10 = 40. Then, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers, so that's 9 more. So, total 8's in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 in the hundreds place would appear in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. For the tens place, I considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributing 10 8's, and then 480-488 contributing 9. That seems correct. So, 4 blocks of 10 (40) plus 9, totaling 49 in the tens place. Units place is 49, so total 8's are 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place was 49 and the tens place was 49, so total 98. So, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me go through each digit place again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place: Each 10 numbers contribute 1, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear. So, units place: 48.\n\nTens place: In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is another 10, so total 50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nSo, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full sets of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers. But wait, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89, so that's correct. Each of those 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's there.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place in 4's, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's there.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, 187 - 98 = 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding how many more '4's are printed than '8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** For every 10 numbers, '4' appears once. There are 48 full sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 '4's. The last 8 numbers (481-488) don't add any '4's in the units place.\n   - **Tens Place:** In each hundred, '4' appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), contributing 40 '4's. Additionally, 440-449 in the range 401-488 adds 10 more '4's, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, each number has a '4' in the hundreds place, contributing 89 '4's.\n   - **Total '4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to '4's, there are 48 full sets of 10, contributing 48 '8's. The last number, 488, adds one more '8', totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** '8' appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each block (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), contributing 40 '8's. Additionally, 480-488 contributes 9 '8's, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No page numbers have '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from '4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each set of ten numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each complete set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. So, for 48 complete sets, that's 48 times each for both 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\nNow, considering the extra numbers from 481 to 488. The units digits here are 1 through 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, in the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 (from the complete sets) plus 1 (from the extra numbers) = 49. Similarly, the total number of 8's in the units place is 48 plus 1 = 49. So, in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal, each appearing 49 times.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each set of 100 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 100 are there? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 extra numbers (401-488). In each complete set of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and so does the digit 8 (80-89). So, for 4 complete sets, that's 4*10 = 40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, looking at the extra numbers from 401 to 488. The tens digit here ranges from 0 to 8. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. The digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times (since 488 is the last page). Wait, but from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 when the page numbers are 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so that's 9 times. Therefore, in the tens place, the number of 4's is 40 (from the complete sets) plus 10 = 50. The number of 8's is 40 plus 9 = 49. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. For the hundreds digit, each digit from 1 to 4 appears 100 times in each set of 1000 numbers, but since our book only goes up to 488, we'll have to adjust. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the highest page number is 488, which only goes up to 4 in the hundreds place. So, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, and 8's appear 0 times.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check my calculations because 188 - 98 is 90, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me go through each digit place again.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n- Complete sets of 10: 48 sets, each contributing 1 to 4 and 1 to 8. So, 48 each.\n- Extra numbers from 481-488: units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n- So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nTens place:\n- Complete sets of 100: 4 sets, each contributing 10 to 4 and 10 to 8. So, 4*10 = 40 each.\n- Extra numbers from 401-488: tens digit cycles 0-8. So, 4 appears in 440-449 (10 times) and 8 appears in 480-488 (9 times).\n- So, tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the maximum is 488, so hundreds digit is only up to 4.\n- So, hundreds place: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nAdding them up:\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place for the extra numbers. From 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for 401-410, tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit is 1; ... up to 480-488, tens digit is 8. So, when the tens digit is 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, when the tens digit is 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that seems correct.\n\nAnother check: Let's think about the total number of digits printed. From 1 to 488, how many digits are there? Well, pages 1-9: 9 pages, each with 1 digit = 9 digits. Pages 10-99: 90 pages, each with 2 digits = 180 digits. Pages 100-488: 389 pages, each with 3 digits = 1167 digits. Total digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits. Now, the total number of digits we counted for 4's is 188 and for 8's is 98, so 188 + 98 = 286. That's way less than 1356, so it seems plausible. But maybe it's correct because we're only counting specific digits.\n\nWait, maybe I should also check another way. Let's calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place again.\n\nUnits place:\n- For each 10 numbers, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, in 488 numbers, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets. Each set contributes 1 to 4 and 1 to 8. So, 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both.\n\nTens place:\n- Each 100 numbers have 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.88, so 4 complete sets. Each set contributes 10 to 4 and 10 to 8. So, 4*10=40 each. Then, the remaining 88 numbers (401-488) have tens digits from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? When the tens digit is 4, the numbers are 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times. For 8, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times. So, total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n- The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up:\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place (from 1 to 480).\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place (from 1 to 400).\n   - Pages 401-488 add 10 more 4's (440-449) and 9 more 8's (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - The digit 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts**:\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference**: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit appears once in the units place every 10 numbers. But wait, actually, from 1 to 10, the digits 1-9 appear once each in the units place, and 0 appears once in 10. So, maybe I should think of it as every 10 pages, each digit from 0-9 appears once in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in a block of 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 ten times each (10-19 have 1 in the tens place, 20-29 have 2, etc.). So, each digit in the tens place appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n\nFor the hundreds place, each digit from 1-9 appears 100 times in a block of 1000 numbers. So, from 1-999, each hundreds digit appears 100 times. But since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit will only go up to 4, and we have to be careful about how many times each digit appears beyond that.\n\nLet me structure this systematically.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in each position:\n\n1. Units place:\n   - Every 10 numbers, there's one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there?\n   - 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing one 4. That gives 48 fours.\n   - But wait, 48*10=480, so from 481 to 488, we have 8 more numbers. In these, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so there's no 4 in the units place here. So, total 4's in units place: 48.\n\n2. Tens place:\n   - Every 100 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for each hundred, there are 10 fours in the tens place.\n   - From 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n   - So, for each complete hundred, 10 fours in the tens place. 4 hundreds * 10 = 40 fours.\n   - Now, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0-8. Let's see how many times 4 appears in the tens place here.\n   - The tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 fours.\n   - So, total fours in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, inclusive. So, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in each position.\n\n1. Units place:\n   - Similar to fours, every 10 numbers, there's one 8 in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 488, 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing one 8. So, 48 eights.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 8 appears once here (at 488). So, total units place eights: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place:\n   - Every 100 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 10 eights per hundred.\n   - From 1 to 488, 4 complete hundreds, so 4*10=40 eights.\n   - In the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles 0-8. The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 eights in the tens place here.\n   - So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems off because when I added the units and tens, I got 49 each, totaling 98. But let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the units place, from 1-488, how many 8's are there? Every 10 numbers, one 8, so 48 times, and then from 481-488, the units digit 8 is at 488, so that's one more, making it 49. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place, each hundred has 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, 9 eights. So, total tens eights: 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, for fours, I had 187 fours. So, 187 fours minus 98 eights equals 89 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, fours:\n\n- Units: 48 fours. Correct, because 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 complete tens, each contributing a 4 in units place, and 488 is the last page, which is 48*10 + 8, so units digit doesn't add another 4.\n\n- Tens: For each hundred, 10 fours in the tens place. 4 hundreds: 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, total tens fours: 40+10=50.\n\n- Hundreds: From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 48+50+89=187. That seems correct.\n\nEights:\n\n- Units: 48 eights from 1-480, plus one more at 488, so 49.\n\n- Tens: 4*10=40 from 1-400, and then in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds: 0, as 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nTotal eights: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 187 fours minus 98 eights equals 89 more fours.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for fours would be 89, but that seems correct because 400-488 is 89 numbers. Let me confirm:\n\n488 - 400 +1 = 89. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the tens place, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 eights.\n\nWait, but 480 is included, so that's 9 numbers. So, 9 eights in the tens place beyond the 40 per hundred.\n\nSo, total eights: 49.\n\nSo, 187 fours minus 98 eights is indeed 89.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position up to 488.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate for each digit position separately.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) = 48, plus if the last digit is >=4, but since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, but we've already counted up to 480, so 48 fours.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: floor(488/10) =48, plus if 488 mod 10 >=8, which it is (8), so 48 +1=49.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)*10 =4*10=40, plus the remaining 88 pages. In the remaining 88, the tens digit cycles from 0-8. The number of times 4 appears in the tens place is the number of complete tens blocks plus any partial.\n\nWait, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles every 10. So, from 401-410: tens digit 0, 411-420:1, ..., 441-450:4, 451-460:5, 461-470:6, 471-480:7, 481-488:8.\n\nSo, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, total tens fours:40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the tens place: in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total tens eights:40+9=49.\n\nFor hundreds digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/1000)*100=0, plus the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nNumber of 8's: floor(488/1000)*100=0, and since 800-899 is beyond 488, no eights in hundreds place.\n\nSo, total fours:48+50+89=187.\n\nTotal eights:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:187-98=89.\n\nSo, the answer should be 89 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for eights. Let me check again.\n\nIn the tens place, for eights, from 1-488:\n\nEach hundred has 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 eights.\n\nSo, total eights in tens place:40+9=49.\n\nSimilarly, in units place, 49 eights.\n\nSo, total eights:49+49=98.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 187-98=89.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one '4' in the units place.\n   - Total blocks of 10 in 488 pages: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 '4's in the tens place.\n   - Total blocks of 100 in 488 pages: 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400).\n   - 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 '4's.\n   - In the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit '4' appears in 440-449, contributing 10 '4's.\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is '4' from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one '8' in the units place.\n   - Total blocks of 10 in 488 pages: 48.\n   - Additionally, page 488 has an '8' in the units place.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 '8's in the tens place.\n   - Total blocks of 100 in 488 pages: 4.\n   - 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 '8's.\n   - In the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit '8' appears in 480-488, contributing 9 '8's.\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place within 488 pages.\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **89**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "num_tokens": 8192,
    "hit_max_tokens": true,
    "text": " Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I think this method will help me systematically count the occurrences of each digit.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block, each digit (including 4 and 8) appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, 4 appears once, and 8 appears once. Similarly, this pattern repeats every 10 numbers.\n\nNext, the tens place: For every block of 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each block of 100, each digit (including 4 and 8) appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, 4 appears in the tens place for 40-49, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 80-89, which is also 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the hundreds place: Since our book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. For each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the hundreds digit is constant. So, 4 appears in the hundreds place for 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, and the hundreds digit only goes up to 4.\n\nWait, let me check that. From 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's zero. From 100-199, hundreds digit is 1, 200-299 is 2, 300-399 is 3, and 400-488 is 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so the count for 8 in the hundreds place is zero, while for 4 it's 89 times.\n\nNow, I should calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then sum them up.\n\nLet me start with the units place:\n\nTotal numbers from 1 to 488. How many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n\nIn each block of 10, as I thought earlier, each digit (including 4 and 8) appears once in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, the number of 4's in units place is 48, and same for 8's, 48 each.\n\nNow, the remaining 8 numbers: 481-488. Their units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in these, 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So, adding these to the previous counts:\n\nTotal 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\nTotal 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nWait, that seems correct because from 1-480, each digit appears 48 times, and then from 481-488, each digit appears once more for 4 and 8.\n\nNext, the tens place:\n\nEach block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, from 1-400, how many complete blocks of 100 are there? 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each block contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 blocks would give 4*10=40 4's and 4*10=40 8's.\n\nNow, the remaining numbers from 401-488. Let's look at the tens digit here. The numbers are 401-488. The tens digit cycles from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). Wait, actually, 401-410: tens digit is 0, 411-420: 1, and so on up to 480-488: 8.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in 401-488? Let's see, the tens digit is 4 when the numbers are 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place when the numbers are 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nAdding this to the previous 40 each:\n\nTotal 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nWait, let me confirm that. From 1-400, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place. Then from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, yes, 50 and 49 respectively.\n\nNow, the hundreds place:\n\nAs I thought earlier, 4 appears in the hundreds place for 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, 89 times.\n\n8 never appears in the hundreds place because the highest page is 488, so the hundreds digit only goes up to 4. So, 0 times for 8.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89\nTotal 8's in hundreds place: 0\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFrom 1-480: 48 blocks of 10, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 and 8, so 48 each.\n\nFrom 481-488: 484 and 488, so 1 each. So, total 49 each. That seems right.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1-400: 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 occurrences of 4 and 8 in the tens place, so 40 each.\n\nFrom 401-488: 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, total 50 4's and 49 8's. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. 0 8's. That makes sense.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 +89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 +49 +0 =98\nDifference: 188 -98 =90\n\nWait, but let me check another way to see if I'm not missing something.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each position separately for each page number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a formula for each digit position.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is given by:\n\nN // 10 * 1 + min(N % 10, d) if d !=0 else N // 10\n\nWait, actually, more accurately, for each digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to N is:\n\nIf N >= d, then (N // 10) + 1, else N //10.\n\nWait, no, perhaps a better way is:\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10, which is N // 10, plus 1 if the remainder (N %10) is >= d.\n\nBut since d can be 0-9, and we're considering digits 4 and 8.\n\nWait, maybe I should test this formula.\n\nFor N=488, units digit count for 4:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: 488 //10 =48\nRemainder:488%10=8\nSince 8 >=4, so total units 4's:48 +1=49\n\nSimilarly, for 8:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10:48\nRemainder:8 >=8, so total units 8's:48 +1=49\n\nThat's correct, which matches my earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\nThe formula is a bit different. The number of times a digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to N is:\n\nLet me see, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each.\n\nSo, for N=488, the number of complete hundreds is 4 (since 488//100=4).\n\nEach complete hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place, so 4*10=40 for both 4 and 8.\n\nThen, for the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8.\n\nThe number of times 4 appears in the tens place in 401-488 is the number of times the tens digit is 4, which is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, the number of times 8 appears in the tens place is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total tens 4's:40 +10=50\nTotal tens 8's:40 +9=49\n\nThat's correct.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nThe number of times 4 appears in the hundreds place is from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nNumber of times 8 appears in the hundreds place is zero, since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place:89\nTotal 8's in hundreds place:0\n\nAdding up:\n\nTotal 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just think again if there's any mistake in the hundreds place. Since the hundreds digit only goes up to 4, and 488 is less than 500, so 488-400+1=89, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nAnd 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book doesn't go beyond 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times.\n\nAnother way to check: Maybe I can calculate the total number of digits printed and see if the counts make sense, but that might be too time-consuming. Alternatively, I can think of a smaller example to test the method.\n\nFor example, let's take a book with 22 pages. How many 1's and 2's are there?\n\nPage numbers:1-22.\n\nCounting 1's:\n\nUnits place:1,11,21 \u2192 3 times\nTens place:10-19 \u219210 times\nHundreds place:0\nTotal 1's:13\n\nCounting 2's:\n\nUnits place:2,12,22 \u21923 times\nTens place:20-22 \u21923 times\nHundreds place:0\nTotal 2's:6\n\nDifference:13-6=7\n\nUsing my method:\n\nUnits place for 1:22//10=2, remainder=2>=1, so 2+1=3\nTens place for 1:22//100=0, so 0*10=0, but 10-19 is within 1-22, so 10-19 is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So total 10.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier formula, for tens place, it's (N//100)*10 + something. Wait, maybe I need to adjust.\n\nWait, for the tens place, the number of times a digit d appears is:\n\nLet me think: For each hundred block, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times. So, for N=22, which is less than 100, the number of complete hundreds is 0, so 0*10=0. Then, the tens digit in 1-22 is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, and 2 for 20-22. So, digit 1 appears 10 times in the tens place (10-19), and digit 2 appears 3 times (20-22). So, total 1's:3 (units) +10 (tens) =13, 2's:3 (units) +3 (tens)=6. So, difference is 7, which is correct.\n\nSo, my method seems to work for this smaller example.\n\nTherefore, applying the same method to the original problem, the difference is 90.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n### Units Place\n- For every block of 10 numbers, each digit (including 4 and 8) appears once in the units place.\n- From 1 to 480, there are 48 complete blocks of 10, contributing 48 occurrences of each digit.\n- From 481 to 488, the units digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Thus, 4 appears once and 8 appears once.\n- **Total 4's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n- **Total 8's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n### Tens Place\n- For every block of 100 numbers, each digit (including 4 and 8) appears 10 times in the tens place.\n- From 1 to 400, there are 4 complete blocks of 100, contributing 40 occurrences of each digit.\n- From 401 to 488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449 (10 times) and 8 for 480-488 (9 times).\n- **Total 4's in tens place:** 40 + 10 = 50\n- **Total 8's in tens place:** 40 + 9 = 49\n\n### Hundreds Place\n- The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences of 4.\n- The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n- **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89\n- **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0\n\n### Total Counts\n- **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n### Difference\n- The difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nThus, the number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I'll calculate how many 4's and 8's appear.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once. But I need to see how many complete blocks there are in 488 pages and if there's a partial block.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's separate the counting based on the number of digits.\n\nFirst, single-digit page numbers: 1 to 9. Here, the digits are just 1 through 9, so 4 appears once, and 8 appears once. So, in single-digit pages, the count for 4 and 8 is equal, so no difference there.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in both places.\n\nLet's start with the tens place. For the tens digit, in two-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 1 to 9. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, the numbers would be 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place, it's 80-89, another 10 numbers, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers. As I thought earlier, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers, which is 9 blocks of 10. So, for each digit, it appears 9 times in the units place. So, 4 appears 9 times, and 8 appears 9 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but actually, from 10 to 99, the units digits cycle 0-9 nine times, so each digit appears 9 times. So, 4 appears 9 times, and 8 appears 9 times in the units place.\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times, and 8 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. So, again, no difference between 4's and 8's in two-digit pages.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100 to 488. This is a bit more complicated because the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, and the tens and units digits can be 0-9, except for the last hundred, which goes up to 488.\n\nI think I should break this down by hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for 4 in the hundreds place, the pages are 400-488. For 8 in the hundreds place, since 800 is beyond 488, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. For the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in each hundred. So, for each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nLet's take each hundred block:\n\n1. 100-199: The tens digit cycles from 0-9 ten times each (since there are 100 numbers). So, for each digit, it appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n2. 200-299: Similarly, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n3. 300-399: Same as above, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n4. 400-488: Here, the tens digit cycles from 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for the tens place, digits 0-8 each appear 10 times, but 9 only appears in 490-499, which are beyond 488. So, in 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0-8, each appearing 10 times. So, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so in 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, and each digit from 0-8 appears 10 times. So, yes, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place for this block.\n\nSo, in the tens place for three-digit numbers, 4 appears 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 times, and 8 appears 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 times. So, no difference here.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in each hundred block, except for the last block which might be cut short.\n\nLet's go through each hundred block:\n\n1. 100-199: The units digit cycles 0-9 ten times each, so each digit appears 10 times. So, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n2. 200-299: Same as above, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n3. 300-399: Same, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n4. 400-488: Here, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens group. Since there are 9 tens groups (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488). Wait, actually, 400-488 is 89 pages, which is 8 full tens groups (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-489, but since we stop at 488, the last group is 480-488, which is 9 pages instead of 10). So, for the units digit in 400-488:\n\n- For tens digits 0-8 (400-488), each units digit 0-9 appears once per tens group. So, for tens digits 0-7 (400-478), each units digit appears 10 times. Then, for tens digit 8 (480-488), units digits go from 0-8, so each digit appears once, except 9 which doesn't appear.\n\nSo, for 400-488:\n\n- For units digit 4: It appears 10 times in each of the first 8 tens groups (400-478), so 8 times 10 = 80, and then in 480-488, 4 appears once (484). So, total 81 times.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, in each tens group, the units digits go from 0-9, so 4 appears once per tens group. So, in 400-478, there are 8 tens groups (400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479), each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 8 times. Then, in 480-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total 8 + 1 = 9 times for 4 in the units place in 400-488.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place in 400-488: It appears once in each of the first 8 tens groups (408, 418, ..., 478), so 8 times, and in 480-488, 8 appears once (488). So, total 8 + 1 = 9 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought each units digit appears 10 times in each hundred block, but that's only if the block is complete (e.g., 100-199). In 400-488, it's not a complete hundred, so the units digits might not all appear the same number of times.\n\nWait, let me correct this. For each hundreds block, except the last one, the units digit appears 10 times for each digit. But in the last block, 400-488, the units digit for each digit 0-8 appears 9 times (since 400-488 is 89 pages, which is 8 full tens groups (each 10 pages) plus a partial group of 9 pages (480-488)). Wait, no, that's not accurate.\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 pages. So, 400-488 can be divided into 8 full tens groups (400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479), each of 10 pages, and then 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, in each full tens group, the units digit cycles 0-9, so each digit appears once. In the partial group, 480-488, the units digits go from 0-8, so digits 0-8 appear once, and 9 doesn't appear.\n\nSo, for the units digit in 400-488:\n\n- For digits 0-8: They appear 8 times (once per full tens group) plus once in the partial group, so 9 times each.\n\n- For digit 9: It appears only 8 times, once in each full tens group, but not in the partial group.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because in each full tens group, each digit appears once in the units place. So, for 8 full tens groups, each digit appears 8 times. Then, in the partial group (480-488), digits 0-8 appear once each, so total for digits 0-8: 8 + 1 = 9 times, and digit 9: 8 times.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 pages: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, units digits 0-8, each appearing once. So, for each digit 0-8, they get an extra count in the units place, making it 8 (from full groups) +1 (partial group) =9, while digit 9 remains at 8.\n\nTherefore, in 400-488:\n\n- Units digit 4 appears 9 times.\n\n- Units digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but that's only in the last hundred block. So, in the three-digit numbers:\n\n- For hundreds blocks 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: Each of these has 100 numbers, so in the units place, each digit appears 10 times. So, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times in each of these blocks.\n\n- For 400-488: Units digit 4 appears 9 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total units place counts for three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4 appears 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\n- 8 appears 10 +10 +10 +9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4 appears 9 times in 400-488, but 10 times in the other blocks, so total 39. Similarly for 8.\n\nWait, but that seems conflicting with my earlier thought. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 100-199: units digit 4 appears 10 times, same as 8.\n\n200-299: same, 10 each.\n\n300-399: same, 10 each.\n\n400-488: units digit 4 appears 9 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total for units place in three-digit numbers:\n\n4: 10 +10 +10 +9 = 39\n\n8: 10 +10 +10 +9 = 39\n\nSo, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 39 times.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 400-488 is only 89 pages, so the units digits shouldn't contribute as much as the other blocks. Maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me think differently. For each hundreds block, except the last one, the units digit cycles 0-9 ten times, so each digit appears 10 times. But in the last block, 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-8 nine times (since it's 89 pages). Wait, no, that's not accurate. Let me correct this approach.\n\nAnother way: For the units digit in three-digit numbers:\n\n- The total number of three-digit page numbers is 488 - 100 +1 = 389 pages.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. 100 to 488 is 389 pages. But perhaps it's better to calculate the units digit occurrences across all three-digit numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to consider that for each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), how many times does 4 and 8 appear.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use a formula or a systematic approach.\n\nFor the units digit in three-digit numbers:\n\nEach digit from 0-9 appears equally in the units place, except possibly in the last block if it's incomplete.\n\nSo, from 100 to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the units place. So, for each of these, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times.\n\nNow, in 400-488, the units digit goes from 0-9 for each tens group, but since 488 is the last page, the last tens group is 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, in 400-488, the units digit 4 appears once per tens group. There are 9 tens groups in 400-488 (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488). Wait, no, 400-488 is 89 pages, which is 8 full tens groups (400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479) and one partial group (480-488). So, in each full tens group, the units digit 4 appears once, so 8 times. In the partial group (480-488), 484 is the only number with units digit 4, so once. So, total units digit 4 in 400-488: 8 +1 =9.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8 appears once in each full tens group (408, 418, ..., 478), so 8 times, and once in the partial group (488), so total 9 times.\n\nTherefore, in three-digit numbers, units digit 4 appears:\n\n- 10 times in each of the first three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399): 3*10=30.\n\n- 9 times in 400-488.\n\nTotal: 30 +9=39.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8 appears 3*10 +9=39.\n\nSo, in units place, both 4 and 8 appear 39 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place in three-digit numbers.\n\nIn each hundreds block, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in 100-199, the tens digit 4 appears in 140-149, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in 180-189, 10 times.\n\nSame for 200-299: 240-249 (10 times), 280-289 (10 times).\n\n300-399: 340-349 (10 times), 380-389 (10 times).\n\n400-488: Now, the tens digit goes up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 times.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds: 3*10=30.\n\n- In 400-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n\n- So, total for 4 in tens place: 30 +10=40.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears:\n\n- 10 times in each of the first three hundreds: 3*10=30.\n\n- In 400-488, 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\n- So, total for 8 in tens place: 30 +9=39.\n\nWait, so in the tens place, 4 appears 40 times, and 8 appears 39 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place in three-digit numbers.\n\nAs I thought earlier, the hundreds digit is 1,2,3,4.\n\n- For 4 in the hundreds place: pages 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\n- For 8 in the hundreds place: Since 800 is beyond 488, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences of 4 and 8 across all digit places.\n\nFirst, let's count for 4:\n\n- Units place: 39 times.\n\n- Tens place: 40 times.\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times.\n\nTotal for 4: 39 +40 +89 = 168 times.\n\nNow, for 8:\n\n- Units place: 39 times.\n\n- Tens place: 39 times.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nTotal for 8: 39 +39 +0 =78 times.\n\nSo, the difference is 168 (number of 4's) -78 (number of 8's) =90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which seems correct because from 400-488, that's 89 pages, each with 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nIn the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 39 times.\n\nSo, 4's total: 89 +40 +39 =168.\n\n8's total: 39 +39 +0 =78.\n\nDifference: 168 -78 =90.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. Did I correctly count 39 times for both 4 and 8?\n\nIn three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-199: units digits 4 and 8 each appear 10 times.\n\n- 200-299: same, 10 each.\n\n- 300-399: same, 10 each.\n\n- 400-488: units digits 4 and 8 each appear 9 times.\n\nSo, total units digit counts:\n\n4: 10+10+10+9=39\n\n8: same, 39.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place:\n\n- 100-199: 10 each.\n\n- 200-299:10 each.\n\n- 300-399:10 each.\n\n- 400-488: 10 for 4, 9 for 8.\n\nSo, 4:3*10 +10=40\n\n8:3*10 +9=39.\n\nYes.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4:89\n\n8:0.\n\nSo, yes, total 4's:168, 8's:78.\n\nDifference:90.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when I counted the tens place in 400-488, I considered that 4 appears 10 times (440-449), which is correct, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, that seems right.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, 480-488 gives 9 occurrences for both 4 and 8 in the units digit.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 168, and the number of 8's is 78, so 168 -78=90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Single-Digit Pages (1-9):**\n   - Both '4' and '8' appear once.\n\n2. **Two-Digit Pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens Place:** Each digit appears 10 times (e.g., '4' in 40-49, '8' in 80-89).\n   - **Units Place:** Each digit appears 9 times (since there are 9 blocks of 10).\n   - Total for two-digit pages: '4' and '8' each appear 19 times.\n\n3. **Three-Digit Pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - '4' appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n     - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - '4' appears 10 times in each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and 10 times in 400-449, totaling 40 times.\n     - '8' appears 10 times in each of the first three hundred blocks and 9 times in 480-488, totaling 39 times.\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Each digit appears 10 times in each complete hundred block and 9 times in 400-488, totaling 39 times for both '4' and '8'.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **'4':** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 39 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 168.\n   - **'8':** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 39 (units) + 39 (tens) = 78.\n\n5. **Difference:** 168 (number of '4's) - 78 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then adjusting for any remainder.\n\nBut wait, since the book has 488 pages, let me see. For the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often except maybe for the last partial block. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. That means there are 48 full blocks of 10 pages and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488). \n\nIn each full block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48. But wait, the last partial block goes up to 488, so I need to check if the units digit in this partial block includes a 4 or an 8. The last 8 pages are 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Looking at the units digits here, we have 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). Therefore, in the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the total number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, they are equal.\n\nMoving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place within each block of 100. So, for the entire book, which is 488 pages, how many full hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial hundred from 401-488.\n\nIn each full hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 10 times per hundred. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for 4 full hundreds, the number of 4's in the tens place is 4 * 10 = 40, and the same for 8's: 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nNow, the partial hundred from 401-488. Let's look at the tens digits here. The tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does each appear? Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which is 8 and appears only 9 times because we stop at 488. Wait, no, let me think again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which is 8. Wait, no, actually, from 401 to 488, the tens digits are as follows:\n\n- 0: 401-410 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 1: 411-420 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 2: 421-430 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 3: 431-440 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 4: 441-450 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 5: 451-460 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 6: 461-470 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 7: 471-480 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 8: 481-488 \u2192 8 numbers\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me list the tens digits correctly. From 401 to 488, the tens digits cycle as:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: tens digit 1\n- 421-430: tens digit 2\n- 431-440: tens digit 3\n- 441-450: tens digit 4\n- 451-460: tens digit 5\n- 461-470: tens digit 6\n- 471-480: tens digit 7\n- 481-488: tens digit 8\n\nSo, each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and the tens digit 8 appears 8 times (since 481-488 is 8 numbers). Therefore, in the tens place for the partial hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times (from 441-450), and the digit 8 appears 8 times (from 481-488). \n\nSo, adding this to the full hundreds, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 4*10 + 10 = 50, and the total number of 8's in the tens place is 4*10 + 8 = 48. Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The 4 full hundreds each contribute 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. Then, in the partial hundred, the 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and the 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, total 4's in tens place: 4*10 +10=50, and 8's in tens place:4*10 +8=48.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because in the partial hundred, the 4 in the tens place is part of the 400s, which we've already accounted for in the hundreds place. Wait, no, the tens place is separate. Let me think again. For the tens digit, in the partial hundred (401-488), the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 441-450, which is 10 times, and the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 481-488, which is 8 times. So, yes, 10 and 8 respectively. So, total 4's in tens place: 4*10 +10=50, and 8's:4*10 +8=48.\n\nWait, but actually, in the full hundreds, each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would be 40 4's and 40 8's. Then, in the partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digits contribute an additional 10 4's and 8 8's. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50, and 8's:40 +8=48.\n\nOkay, so so far, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 48.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present in the three-digit numbers, which are from 100 to 488. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's see how many times each digit appears in the hundreds place.\n\n- For hundreds digit 1: pages 100-199. That's 100 numbers, so the digit 1 appears 100 times in the hundreds place.\n- Similarly, for hundreds digit 2: pages 200-299: 100 times.\n- For hundreds digit 3: pages 300-399: 100 times.\n- For hundreds digit 4: pages 400-488: 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 =89).\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times, and the digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place at all because the highest hundreds digit is 4. So, in the hundreds place, 4's are 89, and 8's are 0.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's = 49 +50 +89 = 188\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:48\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's =49 +48 +0 =97\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- Total pages:488\n- Each 10 pages contribute one 4 and one 8 in units place.\n- 488 divided by 10 is 48 full blocks, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8, so 48 each.\n- Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units 4's:48+1=49, units 8's:48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n- 4 full hundreds:4*10=40 for 4's, 4*10=40 for 8's.\n- Partial hundred (401-488): tens digits 0-8.\n- 4 appears in tens place for 441-450:10 times.\n- 8 appears in tens place for 481-488:8 times.\n- So, total 4's in tens:40+10=50, 8's:40+8=48. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 100-199:100 times 1\n- 200-299:100 times 2\n- 300-399:100 times 3\n- 400-488:89 times 4\n- So, 4's:89, 8's:0. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the tens place, the partial hundred for 401-488, the 4 in the tens place is from 441-450, which is correct. And the 8 in the tens place is from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: for each digit position, calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for the partial hundred. Let me recount. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). Each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. So, the digit 4 in the tens place is in 441-450, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 10 times. The digit 8 in the tens place is in 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but another thought: in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in all pages from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=97\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in the units place every 10 pages.\n   - Total full blocks of 10: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 with a remainder of 8).\n   - Each digit appears 48 times in the units place.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add 1 more 4 and 1 more 8.\n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 pages.\n   - Total full hundreds: 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400).\n   - Each digit appears 10 times per hundred, so 40 times for 4 and 40 times for 8.\n   - The partial hundred (401-488) adds:\n     - 10 times for 4 in the tens place (441-450).\n     - 8 times for 8 in the tens place (481-488).\n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 40 + 10 = 50\n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 40 + 8 = 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is only present in three-digit numbers.\n   - Pages 100-199: 100 times digit 1.\n   - Pages 200-299: 100 times digit 2.\n   - Pages 300-399: 100 times digit 3.\n   - Pages 400-488: 89 times digit 4.\n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89\n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - More 4's than 8's: 188 - 97 = 91\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 91 more times than the digit 8. \n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: In every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. Since the book has 488 pages, I can calculate how many full blocks of 10 there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). Each full block contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the extra 8 numbers, 481-488, the units digit is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, in the units place of the 481-488 block, the digit 4 appears once. Therefore, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for a block of 10 numbers. For example, 40-49 have 4 in the tens place. Each such block contributes 10 times the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, the first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, the next block would be 140-149, and so on. Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers. So, from 0-99, 40-49 is one block; from 100-199, 140-149 is another; from 200-299, 240-249; from 300-399, 340-349; and from 400-488, 440-449. Wait, but 400-488 is only up to 488, so 440-449 is a full block of 10, and then 450-488 is beyond that. So, how many blocks are there?\n\nLet me think: Each hundred has one block where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-99, that's one block (40-49). From 100-199, another (140-149). From 200-299, another (240-249). From 300-399, another (340-349). From 400-488, another (440-449). So that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. Now, wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is a full block, so that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5\u00d710=50. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, 401, 402,..., up to 488. So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's are 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, so each of those 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the 8's. I need to count how many times the digit 8 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nAgain, I'll consider units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place: In every block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full blocks of 10 are there? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48\u00d71=48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in the units place, 8 appears once more. So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 488 - 480 +1 = 9 numbers. So, each block where the tens digit is 8 contributes 10 8's except the last one, which contributes 9.\n\nWait, let me think again. From 1-99: 80-89 is one block, contributing 10 8's in the tens place. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 480,481,...,488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 8's, and the last block contributes 9. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's. Similarly, 180-189: another 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89: 10 8's. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units was 49 and tens was 49, so total 98. Now, the 4's were 188, and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again, because 90 seems high. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the 4's.\n\nWait, when I counted the 4's in the units place, I had 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus the last 8 numbers where 484 has a 4 in the units place, so 48 +1=49. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, I had 5 blocks: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each contributes 10 4's, so 5\u00d710=50. That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's, units place: 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus the last block where 488 has an 8 in the units place, so 48+1=49.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10\u00d74=40 +9=49.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a big difference. Let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately, but perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's.\n\nWait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's. That seems correct.\n\nWait, another way: for 4's, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's.\n\nFor 8's, the hundreds digit never appears, so 0.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's, we have 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d710=50.\n\nIn the units place, every 10 numbers has one 4, so 48 full blocks \u00d71=48, plus the last 8 numbers (481-488) where 484 has a 4, so 48+1=49.\n\nSo, total 4's: 89+50+49=188.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 48 full blocks \u00d71=48, plus 488, so 49.\n\nTens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's, so 4\u00d710=40, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 8's, so 40+9=49.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nHmm, I think that's correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** \n     - In every block of 10 numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20), the digit '4' appears once in the units place.\n     - There are 48 full blocks of 10 in 488 pages, contributing 48 '4's.\n     - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include one more '4' in 484.\n     - Total: 48 + 1 = 49 '4's.\n   \n   - **Tens Place:** \n     - In every block of 100 numbers, '4' appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149).\n     - There are 5 such blocks up to page 488 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n     - Each block contributes 10 '4's, totaling 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 '4's.\n   \n   - **Hundreds Place:** \n     - From page 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is '4' for 89 numbers.\n     - Total: 89 '4's.\n   \n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 '4's.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** \n     - Similar to '4's, there are 48 full blocks of 10, contributing 48 '8's.\n     - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include one '8' in 488.\n     - Total: 48 + 1 = 49 '8's.\n   \n   - **Tens Place:** \n     - '8' appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n     - There are 4 full blocks contributing 10 '8's each (total 40) and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 '8's.\n     - Total: 40 + 9 = 49 '8's.\n   \n   - **Hundreds Place:** \n     - No page numbers have '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n     - Total: 0 '8's.\n   \n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98 '8's.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, the 4 is in 4; from 11-20, it's in 14, and so on. So, I can calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488 and then see how many 4's are in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place: Every 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 40-49, each number has a 4 in the tens place. So, I can calculate how many hundreds there are and multiply by 10, then check if there are any remaining numbers beyond that.\n\nFor the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. So, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, there are 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but I should check if 488 is included. Yes, because 488 is page 488, so the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of 4's in the units place. The total number of pages is 488, so there are 488 numbers. Each group of 10 numbers contributes one 4 in the units place. So, the number of complete groups of 10 is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a group, we take the integer part, which is 48. So, 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, in the last group, from 480 to 488, the units digits go from 0 to 8, so the 4 in the units place is at 484. So, that's included in the 48 groups. So, 48 4's in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the last group is 480-488). So, in each of these 48 groups, the units digit 4 appears once. So, 48 times.\n\nNext, the tens place. For the tens digit, every 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Wait, no, 400-488 is part of the 4th hundred. So, each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40. But wait, the last hundred is only up to 488, so does that affect the count?\n\nWait, from 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 in each ten. So, the 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. So, in the 400s, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, in the 400s, it's 10 times. So, for each hundred, it's 10 times, so 4 hundreds would be 4*10=40. But wait, the 400s only go up to 488, but the tens digit 4 in the 400s is from 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 40 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me think again: from 1-100, the tens digit 4 is in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, from 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10. From 201-300, 240-249, another 10. From 301-400, 340-349, another 10. Then, from 401-488, it's 440-449, another 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, but wait, 400-488 is part of the 4th hundred? Wait, no, 400-488 is part of the 4th hundred, but I think I might have miscounted.\n\nWait, 1-100: 40-49 (10)\n101-200: 140-149 (10)\n201-300: 240-249 (10)\n301-400: 340-349 (10)\n401-488: 440-449 (10)\nSo that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Wait, but earlier I thought 4 hundreds, but actually, the 400s include 400-488, which is part of the 4th hundred. So, maybe it's 5 hundreds? Wait, no, 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, that's 5 segments, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4 hundreds, but now I'm seeing 5 segments. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nEach hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100: 40-49 (10)\n101-200: 140-149 (10)\n201-300: 240-249 (10)\n301-400: 340-349 (10)\n401-488: 440-449 (10)\nSo that's 5 sets, each with 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5*10=50.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is part of the 401-488 segment, which is the 5th segment, but 400 itself is part of the 400s. Wait, no, 400 is included in the 400s, but the tens digit 4 in 400 is in the hundreds place, not the tens. So, 400 has a hundreds digit of 4, but the tens digit is 0. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's correct, 5 sets of 10, so 50.\n\nWait, but let me check: 1-100: 40-49 (10)\n101-200: 140-149 (10)\n201-300: 240-249 (10)\n301-400: 340-349 (10)\n401-488: 440-449 (10)\nSo, that's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place, as I thought earlier, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 4's.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, the units digit 8 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, the last group is 480-488, which includes 488, so the units digit 8 is at 488, which is included, so 48 8's in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place: For the tens digit 8, it appears in every 100 numbers in the range 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-488? Wait, no, 480 has a tens digit of 8, 481 has 8, up to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? Wait, 480 has 8 in the tens place, 481 has 8, ..., 488 has 8. So, that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. But wait, in the earlier hundreds, each set of 100 contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, let's see:\n\nFrom 1-100: 80-89 (10)\n101-200: 180-189 (10)\n201-300: 280-289 (10)\n301-400: 380-389 (10)\n401-488: 480-488 (9)\nSo, that's 4 full sets of 10 and one partial set of 9. So, total 4*10 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 1-100: 80-89 (10)\n101-200: 180-189 (10)\n201-300: 280-289 (10)\n301-400: 380-389 (10)\n401-488: 480-488 (9)\nSo, that's 4*10=40 plus 9=49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nWait, let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 1-100: 80-89 (10)\n101-200: 180-189 (10)\n201-300: 280-289 (10)\n301-400: 380-389 (10)\n401-488: 480-488 (9)\nSo, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 48 (units) + 49 (tens) = 97.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 187, and the number of 8's is 97. So, the difference is 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, for the 4's in the tens place, I thought there were 5 sets of 10, giving 50. But let me recount:\n\n1-100: 40-49 (10)\n101-200: 140-149 (10)\n201-300: 240-249 (10)\n301-400: 340-349 (10)\n401-488: 440-449 (10)\nSo, that's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's in the tens place, I have 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48, which is correct because 488/10=48.8, so 48 full groups.\n\nUnits place for 8's: 48, same logic.\n\nSo, 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n8's: 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers contribute one 4. There are 488 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 times.\n   - **Tens Place:** Every 100 numbers contribute 10 times. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) plus the 400-488 range. Each contributes 10, so 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** Numbers 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to 4's, 488 / 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 times.\n   - **Tens Place:** Every 100 numbers contribute 10 times, but the last set (480-488) contributes 9. So, 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since 800+ exceeds 488).\n   - **Total 8's:** 48 (units) + 49 (tens) = 97.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Difference = Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 187 - 97 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each position for both digits 4 and 8 and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place: For each set of ten numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. How many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). So, in each complete set, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. Therefore, for 48 complete sets, each digit appears 48 times in the units place. Now, for the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, adding these, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both digits appear the same number of times.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. Here, the digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 times, and 8 for 80-89, also 10 times. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each. Now, looking at the remaining pages from 401-488, the tens digit cycles again. Let's break this down: 401-410 has tens digit 0, 411-420 has tens digit 1, and so on. Wait, no, actually, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 in the tens place. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, up to 8 for 481-490. But since our book ends at 488, the last set is 481-488, which is only 8 numbers. \n\nSo, for the tens digit in 401-488, we have the 4's tens digit at 440-449, which is 10 times, and the 8's tens digit at 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 times. Wait, that might not be right. Let me think again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does each occur? For tens digits 0-7, each occurs 10 times (e.g., 400-409 is 10 numbers, but we start at 401, so maybe 9? Wait, no, 401-410 is 10 numbers, right? 401,402,...,410. So, the tens digit is 0 for 10 numbers. Similarly, 411-420 is 10 numbers with tens digit 1, and so on up to 471-480 with tens digit 7, which is 10 numbers. Then, 481-490 would be tens digit 8, but we only go up to 488, so that's 8 numbers (481-488). So, the tens digit 8 occurs 8 times in the last partial set.\n\nWait, but in the context of the entire 488 pages, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times, and the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 times (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-489, but we stop at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place. But wait, earlier, in the hundreds place, we had 4 complete hundreds, so each 100 has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, for the first 400 pages, it's 4 * 10 = 40 for each digit. Then, from 401-488, we have the tens digit 4 appearing 10 times (440-449) and 8 appearing 9 times (480-488). So, total for tens place: 4's = 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 4's have 50, 8's have 49 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place. But 480 is included, right? So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 in 480,481,...,488, which is 9 times. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, and before that, it's 1,2,3. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences for each digit.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) contribute one 4 (484) and one 8 (488), so total units place: 48 +1=49 for both digits.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (440-449) and 8 occurs 9 times (480-488). So, 4's tens: 40 +10=50, 8's tens:40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 4's occur 89 times (400-488), 8's occur 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the hundreds place for 4's is 89, which seems correct because 488-400+1=89. But let me think again: from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 188, and 8's are 98, so 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete sets (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n   - 4's: 48 + 1 (484) = 49\n   - 8's: 48 + 1 (488) = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - 4 complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 each.\n   - From 401-488:\n     - 4's: 10 times (440-449)\n     - 8's: 9 times (480-488)\n   - 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4's: 89 times (400-488)\n   - 8's: 0 times\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each position one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** For every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. So, I can calculate how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488 pages. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and an additional 8 numbers. So, in each block, 4 appears once, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), I need to check if 4 appears in the units place. 484 is within this range, so that's one more. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. Every block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. For example, in 40-49, each number has a 4 in the tens place. So, from 1-488, how many such blocks are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401-488. Each complete block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, in the partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 8 for 410-419, etc., but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 401-488: the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's 10 more 4's. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 4's.\n\nWait, but 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, right? Let me check: 488 - 400 = 88, so adding 1 gives 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, in each block of 10, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's 1 more. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** For the tens place, every block of 100 has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place, like 80-89. So, from 1-488, 4 complete blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Now, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? So, 9 8's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's here.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8. So, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. So, that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place, so 9 8's. So, 40 (from complete blocks) + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought that in the units place, 8 appears 49 times, and in the tens place, 49 times, so total 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me go through each digit place again for both 4 and 8.\n\nFor 4:\n\n- Units place: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 484, which is one more. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles 0-9. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct.\n\nFor 8:\n\n- Units place: 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, which is one more. So, 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 488 /100=4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 +9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: None, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So, 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, difference is 188 -98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For example, in the hundreds place for 4, I counted 89, which is correct because from 400 to 488 inclusive is 89 numbers. For 8, since the book ends at 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAnother check: Let's take a smaller number to test the method. Suppose the book has 20 pages. How many 4's and 8's?\n\nPage numbers 1-20.\n\nCount of 4's: units place: 4,14 \u2192 2. Tens place: 40-49, but 20 is less than 40, so 0. Hundreds place: 0. Total 4's:2.\n\nCount of 8's: units place:8,18 \u21922. Tens place: 80-89, but 20 is less, so 0. Hundreds place:0. Total 8's:2. So, difference is 0. That seems correct.\n\nAnother test: 50 pages.\n\n4's: units: 4,14,24,34,44 \u21925. Tens:40-49\u219210. So total 15.\n\n8's: units:8,18,28,38,48 \u21925. Tens:40-49 doesn't have 8 in tens place. Wait, 80-89 is beyond 50, so 0. So total 8's:5. Difference:15-5=10.\n\nWait, but according to our method, units place for 4:50/10=5, so 5. Tens place:50/100=0.5, so 0 full blocks, but in 1-50, 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10. So, total 4's:5+10=15.\n\nFor 8's: units:50/10=5, so 5. Tens place:50/100=0.5, so 0 full blocks, but in 1-50, 40-49 is the tens place, but 80-89 is beyond. So, tens place 8's:0. So, total 8's:5. Difference:10. That seems correct.\n\nSo, applying the same method to 488, I think it's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full tens (48 occurrences) + 1 in the remaining 8 numbers (484) \u2192 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full hundreds (40 occurrences) + 10 in 440-449 \u2192 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 numbers (400-488) \u2192 89.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full tens (48 occurrences) + 1 in the remaining 8 numbers (488) \u2192 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full hundreds (40 occurrences) + 9 in 480-488 \u2192 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 (since 800-899 is beyond 488).\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each place for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, every 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once as well. \n\nNow, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10, and then an extra 8 pages (481 to 488). In each of these 48 blocks, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, that's 48 times each. Now, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, adding those, the units digit for 4 is 48 + 1 = 49, and for 8, it's 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. That means the difference from units place is zero so far.\n\nNext, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So, for the tens digit, the digit 4 appears 10 times in each block of 100 (like 40-49), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89). \n\nNow, how many full hundreds are there in 488 pages? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then a partial hundred from 401-488. So, in each of the 4 full hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. So, that's 4*10 = 40 times each. \n\nNow, the partial hundred from 401-488: let's see. The tens digit in this range goes from 0 (for 401-410) to 8 (for 480-488). So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers (440-449). But wait, 440 is part of 401-488, so that's 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times, and the digit 8 appears 9 times in the partial hundred. \n\nAdding this to the full hundreds: 40 (from full) + 10 (partial) = 50 times for 4, and 40 (from full) + 9 (partial) = 49 times for 8. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. The difference here is 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit cycles through 1,2,3,4, etc., so 8 would appear in the hundreds place starting from 800, but since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. The difference here is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place:\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1 for 4 and 8, plus the last 8 pages adding 1 each. So 48 +1 = 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each full hundred has 10 for 4 and 10 for 8. So 4 full hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 for 4. For 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So, 9 for 8. So, total tens place: 40 +10=50 for 4, and 40 +9=49 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nAdding up: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188 for 4.\n\nFor 8: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, each of these pages has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about the hundreds place: the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, so that's 89 4's. Since 8 never appears in the hundreds place, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the structure of page numbers:**\n   - Pages 1-9: Single-digit numbers.\n   - Pages 10-99: Two-digit numbers.\n   - Pages 100-488: Three-digit numbers.\n\n2. **Count occurrences in the units place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total full tens: 48 (1-480).\n   - Each contributes 1 occurrence of 4 and 8.\n   - Remaining pages (481-488): 484 and 488 add 1 each.\n   - Total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\n3. **Count occurrences in the tens place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Full hundreds: 4 (1-400).\n   - Each contributes 10 occurrences of 4 and 8.\n   - Remaining pages (401-488): Tens digit 4 appears in 440-449 (10 times), and 8 appears in 480-488 (9 times).\n   - Total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4; 40 + 9 = 49 for 8.\n\n4. **Count occurrences in the hundreds place:**\n   - Digit 4 appears from 400-488: 89 times.\n   - Digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place (book ends at 488).\n   - Total hundreds place: 89 for 4; 0 for 8.\n\n5. **Sum up the counts:**\n   - Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n6. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, subtract the count of 8's from the count of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in each block of 10 numbers. So, in every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. But wait, in the first block (1-9), the units digit is the same as the number itself, so 1-9 have units digits from 1-9, but 0 doesn't appear in the units place for single-digit numbers. Hmm, so maybe I should handle single-digit and multi-digit numbers separately.\n\nLet me separate the problem into single-digit (1-9), two-digit (10-99), and three-digit (100-488) page numbers.\n\nFirst, single-digit pages: 1-9.\n\nIn this range, the units digit is the same as the number. So, how many 4's and 8's are there?\n\n- The digit 4 appears once (page 4).\n- The digit 8 appears once (page 8).\n\nSo, for single-digit pages, 4's: 1, 8's: 1.\n\nNow, moving on to two-digit pages: 10-99.\n\nEach two-digit number can be represented as AB, where A is the tens digit and B is the units digit. A ranges from 1 to 9, and B ranges from 0 to 9.\n\nI need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens and units places.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in the units place for two-digit numbers.\n\nFor each tens digit A (1-9), the units digit cycles from 0-9. So, for each A, there's exactly one 4 in the units place (e.g., 14, 24, ..., 94). Since A can be from 1-9, that's 9 occurrences of 4 in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, it's the same: 18, 28, ..., 98, which is also 9 times.\n\nNow, counting 4's in the tens place.\n\nThe tens digit is 4 for numbers 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, it's 80-89, which is another 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, 4's: units place 9, tens place 10, total 19.\n\n8's: units place 9, tens place 10, total 19.\n\nWait, but that seems like 4's and 8's are equal in two-digit numbers. Hmm, but let me double-check.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the two-digit numbers, the tens digit for 4's is 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, 8's in the tens place is 80-89, 10 times. For the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears 9 times in each position (since A is 1-9). Wait, no, actually, for two-digit numbers, each units digit from 0-9 appears exactly 9 times for each tens digit. So, for each digit in the units place, 0-9, it appears 9 times. So, for 4 in the units place, 9 times, and same for 8.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, 4's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\n8's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, 4's and 8's are both 19 each.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit pages: 100-488.\n\nThis is a bit more complicated. Let me break it down by hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, let's note that the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because 488 is the last page. So, the hundreds digit ranges from 1 to 4.\n\nLet me handle each hundreds group separately: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488.\n\nI'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position (hundreds, tens, units) for each group.\n\nStarting with 100-199:\n\nHundreds digit is 1, so it's fixed. So, we don't get any 4's or 8's in the hundreds place here.\n\nNow, tens and units digits can vary from 0-9 each.\n\nLet me count 4's and 8's in the tens and units places for 100-199.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\nIn the tens place: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9, so 4 appears once in the tens place for each hundred. Since we're only considering 100-199, that's 10 numbers where tens digit is 4 (140-149). So, 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nIn the units place: Similarly, for each hundred, each units digit from 0-9 appears 10 times (once for each tens digit). So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the units place. So, in 100-199, that's 10 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in 100-199: 10 (tens) + 10 (units) = 20.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nIn the tens place: 10 times (180-189).\n\nIn the units place: 10 times (e.g., 108, 118, ..., 198).\n\nSo, total 8's in 100-199: 10 + 10 = 20.\n\nNow, moving to 200-299:\n\nHundreds digit is 2, so no 4's or 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTens and units digits again vary from 0-9.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\nTens place: 4 appears in 240-249, so 10 times.\n\nUnits place: For each tens digit, 4 appears once, so 10 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 10 + 10 = 20.\n\nSimilarly, 8's:\n\nTens place: 280-289, 10 times.\n\nUnits place: 10 times.\n\nTotal 8's: 10 + 10 = 20.\n\nNext, 300-399:\n\nHundreds digit is 3, so no 4's or 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTens and units digits vary.\n\n4's:\n\nTens place: 340-349, 10 times.\n\nUnits place: 10 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 20.\n\n8's:\n\nTens place: 380-389, 10 times.\n\nUnits place: 10 times.\n\nTotal 8's: 20.\n\nNow, the last group: 400-488.\n\nThis is a bit different because it doesn't go up to 499; it stops at 488. So, we need to be careful here.\n\nHundreds digit is 4, so every number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, for 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's count 4's in the tens and units places.\n\nFirst, 4's in the tens place:\n\nIn 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the last number). So, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8.\n\nWe need to find how many times 4 appears in the tens place. That would be when the tens digit is 4, so numbers from 440-449. However, since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is entirely within 400-488. So, that's 10 numbers (440-449), so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nNow, 4's in the units place:\n\nFor each tens digit, the units digit cycles from 0-9. But since the last number is 488, when the tens digit is 8, the units digit only goes up to 8.\n\nSo, let's break this down by each tens digit:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 400-409. Units digits 0-9, so 4 appears once (404).\n- Tens digit 1: 410-419. 414.\n- Tens digit 2: 420-429. 424.\n- Tens digit 3: 430-439. 434.\n- Tens digit 4: 440-449. 444.\n- Tens digit 5: 450-459. 454.\n- Tens digit 6: 460-469. 464.\n- Tens digit 7: 470-479. 474.\n- Tens digit 8: 480-488. Here, units digits go from 0-8, so 484 is included.\n\nSo, for each tens digit from 0-8, except when the tens digit is 8, units digits go up to 9, but when tens digit is 8, units go up to 8.\n\nSo, for each tens digit from 0-7, we have 4 appearing once in the units place (e.g., 404, 414, etc.), so that's 8 times.\n\nFor tens digit 8, units digit 4 appears once (484).\n\nSo, total 4's in the units place: 8 (from tens digits 0-7) + 1 (from tens digit 8) = 9.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For each tens digit from 0-8, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nActually, for tens digits 0-7, each has 10 numbers, so units digits 0-9, so 4 appears once each. That's 8 tens digits, so 8 times.\n\nFor tens digit 8, the numbers are 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, units digits 0-8. So, 4 appears once (484).\n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nSo, 4's in the units place: 9.\n\nSo, total 4's in 400-488:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 10\n- Units place: 9\nTotal: 89 + 10 + 9 = 108.\n\nNow, let's count 8's in 400-488.\n\nFirst, hundreds digit is 4, so no 8's there.\n\nTens and units digits:\n\n8's in the tens place:\n\nLooking for numbers where tens digit is 8. So, 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488. So, that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, 8's in the tens place: 9 times.\n\nWait, but actually, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so that's 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\n8's in the units place:\n\nFor each tens digit, how many times does 8 appear in the units place.\n\nAgain, let's go through each tens digit:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 400-409. Units digits 0-9, so 408.\n- Tens digit 1: 410-419. 418.\n- Tens digit 2: 420-429. 428.\n- Tens digit 3: 430-439. 438.\n- Tens digit 4: 440-449. 448.\n- Tens digit 5: 450-459. 458.\n- Tens digit 6: 460-469. 468.\n- Tens digit 7: 470-479. 478.\n- Tens digit 8: 480-488. Units digits 0-8, so 488 is included, which is 8 in the units place.\n\nSo, for each tens digit from 0-8, there's one occurrence of 8 in the units place, except when the tens digit is 8, where units digit 8 is included.\n\nWait, but when tens digit is 8, units digit can only go up to 8, so 488 is included. So, for each tens digit from 0-8, units digit 8 appears once, except that when tens digit is 8, units digit 8 is allowed.\n\nWait, no, actually, for each tens digit from 0-8, units digit 8 appears once, regardless of the tens digit. So, that's 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me count:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 408\n- Tens digit 1: 418\n- Tens digit 2: 428\n- Tens digit 3: 438\n- Tens digit 4: 448\n- Tens digit 5: 458\n- Tens digit 6: 468\n- Tens digit 7: 478\n- Tens digit 8: 488\n\nThat's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences of 8 in the units place.\n\nSo, 8's in the units place: 9.\n\nSo, total 8's in 400-488:\n\n- Tens place: 9\n- Units place: 9\nTotal: 18.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. For 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 8's in tens place: 9.\n\nUnits place: for each tens digit from 0-8, units digit 8 occurs once, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total 8's: 9 + 9 = 18.\n\nNow, let me sum up all the 4's and 8's across all page ranges.\n\nFirst, single-digit (1-9):\n\n4's: 1\n\n8's: 1\n\nTwo-digit (10-99):\n\n4's: 19\n\n8's: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n100-199: 4's 20, 8's 20\n\n200-299: 4's 20, 8's 20\n\n300-399: 4's 20, 8's 20\n\n400-488: 4's 108, 8's 18\n\nSo, adding up all 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n100-199:20\n\n200-299:20\n\n300-399:20\n\n400-488:108\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 108\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n1 + 19 = 20\n\n20 + 20 = 40\n\n40 + 20 = 60\n\n60 + 20 = 80\n\n80 + 108 = 188\n\nSo, total 4's: 188\n\nNow, total 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n100-199:20\n\n200-299:20\n\n300-399:20\n\n400-488:18\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 18\n\nCompute:\n\n1 + 19 = 20\n\n20 + 20 = 40\n\n40 + 20 = 60\n\n60 + 20 = 80\n\n80 + 18 = 98\n\nSo, total 8's: 98\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract 8's from 4's:\n\n188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, for 400-488, I had 89 numbers with 4 in the hundreds place, which is correct because 488 - 400 +1 = 89.\n\nThen, 4's in tens place: 10 (440-449).\n\n4's in units place: 9, as calculated.\n\nSo, 89 + 10 +9 = 108, which seems correct.\n\nFor 8's in 400-488:\n\nTens place: 9 (480-488).\n\nUnits place: 9 (408, 418, ..., 488).\n\nTotal 18, which seems correct.\n\nSo, adding up all 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\n100-199:20\n\n200-299:20\n\n300-399:20\n\n400-488:108\n\nTotal:1+19=20; 20+20=40; 40+20=60; 60+20=80; 80+108=188.\n\n8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\n100-199:20\n\n200-299:20\n\n300-399:20\n\n400-488:18\n\nTotal:1+19=20; 20+20=40; 40+20=60; 60+20=80; 80+18=98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I didn't make a mistake in the three-digit numbers, especially in the 400-488 range.\n\nWait, in 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in hundreds place.\n\nTens place: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\nUnits place: for each tens digit from 0-8, 4 appears once in units place, except when tens digit is 8, where it only goes up to 8, so 484 is included. So, 9 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 9, but actually, for tens digits 0-7, that's 8 tens digits, each contributing one 4 in units place, and tens digit 8 contributing one 4 in units place (484). So, 8 +1 =9.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in 400-488:\n\nTens place: 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's.\n\nUnits place: for each tens digit 0-8, 8 appears once, so 9 times.\n\nSo, 9 +9=18, correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, 8's:98.\n\nDifference:90.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a lot. Let me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nLet's consider each digit position: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nFor each position, calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the units place.\n\nIn each block of 10 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, for every 10 numbers, 4 and 8 each appear once.\n\nTotal number of complete blocks of 10 in 488 numbers: 488 /10 =48 complete blocks, with 8 remaining numbers (481-488).\n\nSo, in units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: 48 (from complete blocks) +1 (if 484 is within the remaining 8 numbers). Wait, the remaining numbers are 481-488, so 484 is included, so units digit 4 appears once more.\n\nSo, total 4's in units place:48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place:48 (from complete blocks) +1 (488 is included, so 488 has units digit 8). So, 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, but wait, 488 is the last number, so units digit 8 appears once in the incomplete block.\n\nSo, 4's:49, 8's:49.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did it per range, I had more 4's. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the per-position approach.\n\nWait, let me check.\n\nWait, in the per-position approach, units digit:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in units place?\n\nIt's the number of times the units digit is 4. So, every 10 numbers, once. So, 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full times, and then in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 484 is included, so 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: same logic, 48 full times, plus 488, so 49 times.\n\nSo, 4's:49, 8's:49.\n\nBut in my earlier per-range approach, I had more 4's. There's a discrepancy here, so I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the per-range approach, I had 188 4's and 98 8's, which would mean 90 more 4's. But in the per-digit approach, units place:49 each, tens and hundreds to be calculated.\n\nWait, perhaps the per-digit approach is more accurate.\n\nLet me try this approach again.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) + (1 if 488 >= (4 mod 10) else 0). Wait, actually, the formula is:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in units place from 1 to n is:\n\nfull_blocks = n // 10\n\nremainder = n % 10\n\ncount = full_blocks\n\nif d <= remainder:\n    count +=1\n\nSo, for 4:\n\nfull_blocks = 488 //10 =48\n\nremainder=8\n\nsince 4 <=8, count=48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8:\n\nfull_blocks=48\n\nremainder=8\n\n8<=8, so count=48+1=49.\n\nSo, units place:4's=49,8's=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNow, for tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each block of 100 numbers.\n\nSo, from 1-488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, etc.), but 488 is less than 500, so the last partial hundred is 401-488.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to calculate how many times each digit appears in the tens place.\n\nThe formula for the number of times digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to n is:\n\nfull_hundreds = n // 100\n\ncount = full_hundreds * 10\n\nremainder = n % 100\n\nif d < (remainder // 10):\n    count +=10\nelif d == (remainder //10):\n    count += (remainder //10)\nelse:\n    count +=0\n\nWait, maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each.\n\nSo, for each hundred, 10 times each digit in the tens place.\n\nFrom 1-400, there are 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n\nSo, for 4's in tens place:4 *10=40.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in tens place:4 *10=40.\n\nNow, from 401-488, which is 88 numbers.\n\nIn the tens place, the tens digit cycles from 0-8 (since 488 is the last number). So, for 401-488:\n\nTens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488).\n\nSo, for each tens digit from 0-8, how many times does it appear?\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits are:\n\n- 0: 401-410: 10 numbers\n- 1:411-420:10\n- 2:421-430:10\n- 3:431-440:10\n- 4:441-450:10\n- 5:451-460:10\n- 6:461-470:10\n- 7:471-480:10\n- 8:481-488:8 numbers\n\nSo, for each tens digit from 0-7, it appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, for 4's in tens place in 401-488: when tens digit is 4, which is 441-450, 10 numbers. So, 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in tens place: when tens digit is 8, which is 481-488, 8 numbers. So, 8 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place from 401-488:10\n\nTotal 8's in tens place from 401-488:8\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place:\n\nFrom 1-400:40\n\nFrom 401-488:10\n\nTotal:40 +10=50\n\nSimilarly, total 8's in tens place:\n\nFrom 1-400:40\n\nFrom 401-488:8\n\nTotal:40 +8=48\n\nSo, 4's in tens place:50\n\n8's in tens place:48\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-488, the hundreds digit is:\n\n- 1:100-199:100 numbers\n- 2:200-299:100\n- 3:300-399:100\n- 4:400-488:89 numbers\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? 89 times (from 400-488).\n\nHow many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Never, because the highest hundreds digit is 4.\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n\n4's:89\n\n8's:0\n\nNow, summing up all occurrences:\n\n4's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:50\n\nHundreds place:89\n\nTotal:49 +50 +89=188\n\n8's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:48\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal:49 +48=97\n\nWait, earlier I had 98, but now it's 97. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the per-range approach.\n\nWait, in the per-digit approach, units place for 8's:49, tens place:48, hundreds:0, total 97.\n\nBut in the per-range approach, I had 98. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let me check the tens place in 400-488 again.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0-8, as I had before.\n\nWhen calculating 8's in tens place, I had 8 occurrences (481-488), which is correct.\n\nSo, in the per-digit approach, 8's in tens place:40 (from 1-400) +8=48.\n\nUnits place:49\n\nSo, total 8's:48+49=97.\n\nBut in the per-range approach, I had 98. Where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, in the per-range approach, in the 400-488 section, I had 8's in tens place:9, and units place:9, total 18. But in the per-digit approach, it's 8 in tens place and 9 in units place, totaling 17, but that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, no, in the per-digit approach, units place for 8's is 49, which includes all occurrences from 1-488, not just 400-488.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the two approaches. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the per-digit approach, I calculated units, tens, and hundreds places across the entire range, so the counts are accurate.\n\nIn the per-range approach, I broke it down into single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit, and then each three-digit hundred group, which may have led to an error.\n\nWait, in the per-range approach, for 400-488, I had 8's in tens place:9, and units place:9, totaling 18. But in the per-digit approach, it's 8 in tens place and 9 in units place, totaling 17 in 400-488. But overall, in the per-digit approach, the total 8's are 97, which is 49 (units) +48 (tens). So, perhaps in the per-range approach, I had an off-by-one error.\n\nWait, perhaps in the per-range approach, when I calculated 400-488, I had 9 8's in units place, but actually, it should be 9 in units place and 9 in tens place, totaling 18, but in the per-digit approach, it's 8 in tens place and 9 in units place, totaling 17 in 400-488, but overall, the per-digit approach gives 97 8's, which is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the per-digit approach is more accurate, so I should go with that.\n\nSo, according to the per-digit approach:\n\n4's:188\n\n8's:97\n\nDifference:188 -97=91.\n\nWait, but earlier in the per-digit approach, I had 4's as 188 and 8's as 97, so the difference is 91.\n\nBut wait, in the per-digit approach, units place for 8's is 49, tens place 48, hundreds 0, total 97.\n\nIn the per-range approach, I had 98 8's. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the per-digit approach.\n\nWait, let's recalculate the units place for 8's.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nIt's the number of times the units digit is 8.\n\nEvery 10 numbers, once. So, 488 /10=48 full blocks, with 8 remaining numbers (481-488).\n\nSo, number of 8's in units place:48 (from full blocks) +1 (since 488 is included, units digit 8). So, 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in units place:49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nEach hundred block contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place.\n\nFrom 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times for 8 in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0-8. So, the number of times 8 appears in the tens place is when the tens digit is 8, which is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, 8 times.\n\nThus, total 8's in tens place:40 +8=48.\n\nSo, total 8's:49 (units) +48 (tens)=97.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:50\n\nHundreds place:89\n\nTotal:49+50+89=188.\n\nSo, 4's:188, 8's:97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, but in the per-range approach, I had 188-98=90.\n\nSo, where's the discrepancy?\n\nAh, I think in the per-range approach, when I calculated 8's in 400-488 as 18, but in the per-digit approach, it's 8 in tens place and 9 in units place, totaling 17 in 400-488. But when I summed up, I had 98 8's, which is incorrect because the per-digit approach gives 97.\n\nSo, likely, the per-digit approach is correct, giving a difference of 91.\n\nWait, but let me check again.\n\nIn the per-digit approach:\n\n4's:188\n\n8's:97\n\nDifference:91.\n\nBut in the per-range approach, I had 188-98=90.\n\nI think the error is in the per-range approach when calculating 8's in 400-488.\n\nWait, in the per-range approach, for 400-488, I had 8's in tens place:9 (480-488), which is correct because 480-488 is 9 numbers.\n\nUnits place:9 (408,418,...,488), which is correct because each"

    "text": " Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block, the digit 4 appears once (e.g., 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8 (e.g., 8, 18, 28, etc.). Now, I need to figure out how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488 pages and how many extra numbers are left beyond that.\n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). In each complete block, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the same for 8's. Now, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, does 4 appear here? Yes, at 484. And 8 appears at 488. So, that's one 4 and one 8 in the units place of the remaining numbers. So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 fours and 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\nWait, but wait, 481-488 are 8 numbers, so the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each block of 100. For example, in 0-99, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in 80-89. So, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488, which is 88 numbers.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49 in 1-100, 140-149 in 101-200, etc.), so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred. Since there are 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours in the tens place. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4 * 10 = 40 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 numbers from 401 to 488. Let's break this down. The tens digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit is 1; and so on, up to 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the last set is 481-488, where the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but we only have 481-488, which is 8 numbers. Wait, actually, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but we only go up to 488). So, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear in 401-488? Let's see: 440-449 would be the range where the tens digit is 4. But wait, in 401-488, does 440-449 fall within? Yes, because 440 is within 401-488. So, from 440-449, that's 10 numbers, so the tens digit is 4 for 10 times. So, in the remaining 88 numbers, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no: 480 is part of 401-488, so from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but 480 is included in 401-488, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the remaining 88 numbers.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: from 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does each appear? Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times, except for the last one, which might be less. Wait, no: 401-488 is 88 numbers, which is 8 full tens (each 10 numbers) and 8 extra numbers. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, the tens digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in 401-410, tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit is 1; ... up to 481-490, but we stop at 488. So, from 401-488, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? It's in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we stop at 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the remaining 88 numbers.\n\nWait, but let me check: 480 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (including both 480 and 488). So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. Therefore, in the tens place, in the remaining 88 numbers, the number of 4's is 10 and the number of 8's is 9.\n\nSo, total tens place: fours = 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from remaining) = 50. Eights = 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from remaining) = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the remaining 88 numbers had 10 fours and 9 eights in the tens place. So, adding to the complete hundreds, which had 40 each, that gives 50 fours and 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. Therefore, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, total hundreds place: fours = 89, eights = 0.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit position.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor eights:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal eights = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, so the number of fours is 188 and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFirst, units place: 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, the last 8 numbers (481-488) contribute one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, units: 48 +1 = 49 fours, 48 +1 = 49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: In each complete hundred (1-100, etc.), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so 4 per hundred. 4 hundreds, so 40 fours. Similarly, 40 eights. Then, in the remaining 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total tens: 40 +10=50 fours, 40 +9=49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. No eights. So, total fours: 49 +50 +89=188, eights:49 +49 +0=98. Difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For example, in the hundreds place, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so no fours or eights there. From 100-399, the hundreds digit is 1,2,3, so no fours or eights. From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 fours.\n\nWait, another way to check: total number of fours is 188, eights is 98, so difference is 90. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place in the remaining 401-488. When I considered the tens digit, I said that 4 appears 10 times in 440-449, which is correct. For 8, it's in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place in the remaining 88 numbers. So, yes, 40 +10=50 fours, 40 +9=49 eights.\n\nAnother check: total number of digits printed. Let me see, from 1-488, how many digits are there? Well, 1-9: 9 numbers, 1 digit each: 9 digits. 10-99: 90 numbers, 2 digits each: 180 digits. 100-488: 389 numbers, 3 digits each: 1167 digits. Total digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits.\n\nNow, the number of fours is 188, and eights is 98. So, 188 +98=286. The remaining digits would be 1356 -286=1070. That seems plausible, but maybe not necessary for the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I should also consider that in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times, which is correct because from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, another way to calculate the number of fours: in each position, units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits: For each 10 numbers, one 4. So, 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and then in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total units fours: 48 +1=49.\n\nTens: For each 100 numbers, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49, etc.), so 4 times 10=40 fours. Then, in the remaining 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, total tens fours:40 +10=50.\n\nHundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours:49 +50 +89=188.\n\nSimilarly, for eights:\n\nUnits: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, units eights:48 +1=49.\n\nTens: Each 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place (80-89, etc.), so 4 times 10=40 eights. Then, in the remaining 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 eights. So, total tens eights:40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds: 0 eights.\n\nTotal eights:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, so the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - For every 10 numbers, '4' and '8' each appear once.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks of 10 in 488, contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) add one '4' (484) and one '8' (488).\n   - Total: 49 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each 100 numbers contribute 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the tens place.\n   - 4 complete hundreds contribute 40 '4's and 40 '8's.\n   - The remaining 88 numbers (401-488) add 10 '4's (440-449) and 9 '8's (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - '4' appears in 400-488, contributing 89 '4's.\n   - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 '4's and 0 '8's.\n\nSumming up:\n- Total '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Total '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, subtract the count of 8's from the count of 4's to get the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I think this methodical approach will help me avoid missing any numbers.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in each place:\n\n1. Units place: In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, I can calculate how many such blocks there are in 488 numbers. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 4. That gives 48 fours. But wait, the last partial block is from 481 to 488, which includes 484. So, that's an extra 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Similarly, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks are there up to 488. The hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. Wait, but page numbers start at 1, so the hundreds digit can be 0 (for pages 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). \n\nFor the tens place, each time the tens digit is 4, it contributes 10 fours. So, how many times does the tens digit equal 4? Let's see:\n\n- Pages 40-49: tens digit is 4, so 10 fours.\n- Pages 140-149: another 10 fours.\n- Pages 240-249: another 10 fours.\n- Pages 340-349: another 10 fours.\n- Pages 440-449: another 10 fours.\n\nWait, but the book only goes up to 488, so pages 440-449 are included, but 450-488 don't have the tens digit as 4. So, that's 5 blocks each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50 fours.\n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 in pages 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because in the hundreds place, each number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to 4's, in the units place, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many 8's in the units place? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8. Then, the last partial block from 481-488 includes 488, which is an 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. Tens place: For the tens digit being 8, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count each:\n\n- 80-89: 10 eights in the tens place.\n- 180-189: 10 eights.\n- 280-289: 10 eights.\n- 380-389: 10 eights.\n- 480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), each contributing an 8 in the tens place. Wait, no, actually, in the tens place, each number from 480-488 has 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 numbers, but each contributes one 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 eights.\n\nWait, but earlier blocks have 10 each. So, total eights in the tens place are 4 blocks with 10 eights each and one block with 9 eights. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights.\n\nWait, let me check: 80-89: 10 eights, correct. 180-189: 10, correct. 280-289: 10, correct. 380-389: 10, correct. 480-488: 9 eights. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, does the hundreds digit ever equal 8? The hundreds digit goes from 0 (for pages 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). So, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the page numbers were 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Units: 49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's are 188, total 8's are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full decades (each 10 pages) plus one more in 484, so 49. That seems right.\n- Tens place: 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50. That's correct.\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Correct.\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188. That's correct.\n\nCounting 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full decades plus one in 488, so 49. Correct.\n- Tens place: 5 blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct.\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place in 4's, 5 blocks, each 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 49, correct.\n\nFor 8's, units place:49, tens place:49, correct.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** Every 10 numbers contribute one '4'. There are 48 full decades (1-480) and one extra in 484, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens place:** Every block of 100 numbers (e.g., 40-49) contributes 10 '4's. There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 contribute 89 '4's.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to '4's, 49 '8's.\n   - **Tens place:** Blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The last block contributes 9 '8's, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No '8's as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the count of 8's from the count of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, how many groups of 10 are there in 488? That's 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a group, I think it's 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 48 times 10 is 480, so from 1 to 480, there are 48 fours in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again in the units place. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each set of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for 488 pages, how many full hundreds do we have? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these has 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 times 10 is 40. Now, from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit in 481-488 is 8. So, in the 400s, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., 8 for 481-490. But since we stop at 488, the tens digit 8 only appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 for 441-450, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 441-450 is within 401-488, so that adds another 10 fours in the tens place. So, total fours in the tens place are 40 (from the first 400 pages) plus 10 (from 441-450), totaling 50.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1-400, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, no, each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place. So, 1-100: 40-49 (10 fours), 101-200: 140-149 (10), 201-300: 240-249 (10), 301-400: 340-349 (10). That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 fours, making the total 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nSo, total fours in all positions: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with units place. Similar to fours, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many 8's in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, from 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so that's another 8 in 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, no, wait. Because 488 is included, so from 1-480, there are 48 eights in the units place (since 480/10=48). Then, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\nNext, tens place. The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Each of these ranges contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which contributes 9 eights because 489 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, how many full ranges of 100 have 10 eights in the tens place? From 1-400, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\nNow, hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nSo, total eights in all positions: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 1-400, we have four sets where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 4*10=40 eights. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place eights were 49, and tens place 49, so total 98. But let me check units place again. From 1-480, every 10 numbers have one 8, so 48 eights. Then, 488 is the 489th number, but 488 is included, so units digit 8 appears once more in 488. So, 48+1=49. That's correct.\n\nSo, total eights: 49+49=98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place eights were 49, and tens place 49, so total 98 eights.\n\nNow, total fours were 187, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours. Let me recount the fours.\n\nUnits place: from 1-488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours. Then, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear again. So, units place fours: 48.\n\nTens place: in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 1-400, there are four hundreds, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place: 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, tens place fours: 40+10=50.\n\nHundreds place: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours.\n\nSo, total fours: 48+50+89=187. That seems correct.\n\nEights: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds 0, total 98.\n\nSo, 187 fours minus 98 eights equals 89 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly. Let me think about the units place again. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. So, the last one is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. Then, 488 is the next number, but 488's units digit is 8, so no more fours in units place. So, units fours: 48.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in units place: 8,18,28,...,488. So, the last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units eights:49.\n\nTens place: for fours, from 1-400, each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, 440-449 adds another 10, so 50.\n\nFor eights in tens place: from 1-400, each hundred has 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 adds 9 eights, so 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: fours in 400-488: 89. Eights: none.\n\nSo, yes, 187 fours and 98 eights, difference 89.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 fours. Correct.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 89 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one '4'.\n   - Total groups of 10 in 488: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n   - Total '4's in units place: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers contribute 10 '4's in the tens place.\n   - From 1-400: 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 '4's \u2192 4\u00d710=40.\n   - From 401-488: 440-449 contributes another 10 '4's.\n   - Total '4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have '4' in the hundreds place.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total '4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total '4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one '8'.\n   - From 1-480: 48 '8's.\n   - Page 488 adds another '8'.\n   - Total '8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers contribute 10 '8's in the tens place.\n   - From 1-400: 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 '8's \u2192 4\u00d710=40.\n   - From 401-488: 480-488 contributes 9 '8's.\n   - Total '8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have '8' in the hundreds place (book ends at 488).\n   - Total '8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = **89**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll need to check each place for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of ten numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4), and 8 appears once (page 8). This pattern repeats every ten numbers. Now, I need to figure out how many complete groups of ten there are in 488 pages and then see if there's a partial group.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of complete tens in 488. That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete groups of ten and an additional 8 numbers (481-488). In each of the 48 complete groups, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Similarly, the units digit 8 appears 48 times. Now, in the partial group from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). Therefore, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, in the units place, they are equal.\n\nNext, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, in 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? That's 4 (since 400 is the fourth hundred). So, from 1-400, each digit appears 4 times in the tens place, except maybe the last partial hundred. Wait, no, actually, each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has each digit appearing 10 times in the tens place. So, from 1-400, there are 4 complete hundreds, so each digit appears 4*10 = 40 times in the tens place. Now, from 401-488, we have another 88 pages. The tens digit here would be 0 (for 401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490). But since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but we only have up to 488, so it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in 480-488. But wait, 480 is part of the 400-499 range, so in the tens place, 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, but since we're only going up to 488, it's only 8 times in the tens place for 480-488. Hmm, maybe I should think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to calculate the number of times each digit appears in the tens place across all page numbers. Let me think again.\n\nFor the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in each hundred. So, for 1-100, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89). Similarly, for 101-200, 4 appears 10 times (140-149), and 8 appears 10 times (180-189). This pattern continues up to 400. So, from 1-400, each digit appears 4 times in the tens place, each time 10 numbers, so 4*10=40 times for 4 and 40 times for 8.\n\nNow, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490). But since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times. Therefore, in the tens place, 4 appears 40 times, and 8 appears 40 + 8 = 48 times. Wait, no, because from 1-400, 4 appears 40 times, and 8 appears 40 times. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10 times. So, total for 4 in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 times. For 8, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480 is included, so that's 9 numbers, but 480 is part of the 480-489 range. Wait, but 480 is page 480, which is included in 401-488. So, from 480-488, that's 9 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. Therefore, total for 8 in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, but 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, 9 times. So, 4 in tens place: 50 times, 8 in tens place: 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. From 1-400, each digit in tens place appears 40 times. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 more, making it 50. For 8, the tens digit appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more, making it 40 + 9 = 49. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, but 480 is page 480, so pages 480, 481, ..., 488: that's 9 pages. So, 9 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many times does 4 appear here? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only has 488 pages, so the hundreds digit only goes up to 4. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the units and tens places because earlier I thought units place for both 4 and 8 was 49, and tens place for 4 was 50, and for 8 was 49.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's total: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place for 4. From 1-400, 4 appears 40 times in the tens place. Then, from 401-488, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 more, making it 50. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place, from 1-400, it's 40 times. Then, from 401-488, 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times, so 49 total. That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 doesn't appear at all. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's another way.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider each digit place separately and count the occurrences.\n\nUnits place:\n- For each group of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n- Total number of complete groups of 10 in 488 is 48 (since 48*10=480), with 8 remaining numbers (481-488).\n- So, 48 complete groups contribute 48*1=48 fours.\n- In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484).\n- Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\n- Similarly, 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nTens place:\n- For each group of 100 numbers, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n- So, from 1-400, there are 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n- So, 4*10=40 fours and 40 eights.\n- From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n- The digit 4 in the tens place appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more fours.\n- The digit 8 in the tens place appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more eights.\n- So, total fours in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\n- Total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nHundreds place:\n- The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89)\n- The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n- So, fours in hundreds place: 89\n- Eights in hundreds place: 0\n\nNow, adding them up:\n- Fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- Eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nI think that's the answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Analyze Each Digit Place:**\n   - **Units Place:** For every group of ten numbers, both '4' and '8' appear once in the units place.\n     - Complete groups: 48 (480 pages), contributing 48 each.\n     - Remaining pages (481-488): '4' appears once (484), '8' appears once (488).\n     - Total: '4' = 49, '8' = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** Each digit appears 10 times per hundred.\n     - From 1-400: '4' appears 40 times, '8' appears 40 times.\n     - From 401-488: '4' appears in 440-449 (10 times), '8' appears in 480-488 (9 times).\n     - Total: '4' = 50, '8' = 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** '4' appears from 400-488 (89 times), '8' never appears.\n     - Total: '4' = 89, '8' = 0.\n\n2. **Sum the Occurrences:**\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, I'll subtract the count of 8's from the count of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (at page 4). From 11-20, it's at 14, and so on. So, how many groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, there are 48 full groups of 10 and then 8 extra pages (481-488). So, in each of the 48 full groups, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is one of them, which adds another 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, this happens in every hundred, like 140-149, 240-249, etc. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages in the 401-488 range. Wait, actually, the hundreds go up to 400, and then 401-488 is another 88 pages. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, for 4 full hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit can be 0 (for 401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-490). But since we only go up to 488, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only in 441-450. That's 10 numbers, but since our range only goes up to 488, 441-450 is fully included because 450 is less than 488. So, that's another 10 times. So, total tens place 4's are 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 1-400, each hundred has a 40-49, 140-149, etc., so 10 per hundred, 4 hundreds, so 40. Then, 401-488: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, contributing 89 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? That seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, units place: I think I made a mistake there. Let me recount the units place 4's. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is one of them, adding one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: As before, 40 from the first 400 pages, and 10 from 440-449 in the 401-488 range, so 50 in total. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. So total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with units place: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is included, which adds another 8. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, in each hundred, that's 10 times. From 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488). Therefore, total tens place 8's: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, so total 4's are 188 and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, I think I might have overcounted the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nFor the 4's in the tens place: 40 from the first 400 pages, and 10 from 440-449, so 50. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: 49, correct.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 4's.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49, correct.\n\nTens place: 40 from 1-400, and 9 from 480-488, so 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 1-400, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? It's 10 times per hundred, so 4 hundreds, so 40 times. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, from 1-400, 10 times per hundred, 4 hundreds, so 40. Then, in 401-488, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10. So, 50 total.\n\nWait, but in the 401-488 range, when considering the tens digit for 4's, is 440-449 fully included? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is within 401-488, so that's 9 numbers. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, I think the calculations are correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check once more to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 full groups (1-480) + 1 in 481-488 (484) = 49\n- Tens: 40 from 1-400, 10 from 440-449 = 50\n- Hundreds: 89 from 400-488\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 full groups (1-480) + 1 in 481-488 (488) = 49\n- Tens: 40 from 1-400, 9 from 480-488 = 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full groups of 10 (1-480) + 1 in 481-488 (484) = 49\n- **Tens place:** 10 per hundred for 400 pages (40) + 10 in 440-449 = 50\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 numbers (400-488) = 89\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full groups of 10 (1-480) + 1 in 481-488 (488) = 49\n- **Tens place:** 10 per hundred for 400 pages (40) + 9 in 480-488 = 49\n- **Hundreds place:** 0\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. For example, from 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit appears once in the units place every 10 numbers. But since the book ends at 488, I need to check if the last block is complete or not.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many complete blocks of 10 there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and an additional 8 pages (481-488). So, in the units place, for each digit from 0 to 9, they appear 48 times in each complete block. Then, in the incomplete block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so digits 1-8 each appear once more, and 9 and 0 don't appear in this last partial block.\n\nWait, but actually, the first page is 1, so the first block is 1-10, right? So, from 1-10, each digit 1-9 appears once in the units place, and 0 appears once as well (page 10). So, for the units place, the number of times a digit appears is:\n\nNumber of complete blocks = floor(488 / 10) = 48 blocks, each contributing one occurrence of each digit in the units place. Then, the remaining pages are 488 - (48 * 10) = 8 pages, which are 481-488. So, the units digits in these are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, digits 1-8 each get an extra count, but 9 and 0 don't.\n\nSo, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 (from complete blocks) plus 1 (from the partial block), totaling 49. Similarly, the number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the difference in the units place is 0.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Each complete block of 10 pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Since there are 48 complete blocks, that's 48 4's and 48 8's. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1 through 8, so 4 and 8 each appear once more. So, 48 + 1 = 49 for both. So, yes, units place contributes 49 each, so no difference there.\n\nNext, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, ..., 9 for 90-99. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 pages.\n\nNow, the book has 488 pages, which is 4 hundreds (400 pages) plus 88 pages. So, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these 100-page blocks has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49), and the same for 8 (e.g., 80-89). So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 4's and 40 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the remaining pages are 401-488, which is 88 pages. Let's see how the tens digit behaves here. From 401-410, the tens digit is 0. 411-420: tens digit 1. 421-430: tens digit 2. 431-440: tens digit 3. 441-450: tens digit 4. 451-460: tens digit 5. 461-470: tens digit 6. 471-480: tens digit 7. 481-488: tens digit 8.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so from 481-488, the tens digit is 8, but only for 8 pages (481-488). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in 401-488?\n\nLooking at the tens digits:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 pages)\n- 411-420: 1 (10)\n- 421-430: 2 (10)\n- 431-440: 3 (10)\n- 441-450: 4 (10)\n- 451-460: 5 (10)\n- 461-470: 6 (10)\n- 471-480: 7 (10)\n- 481-488: 8 (8 pages)\n\nSo, in the tens place, digit 4 appears once in 441-450 (10 times). Digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times. So, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, total in the tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50\n- 8's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 8 (from 401-488) = 48\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 48 times. So, the difference here is 50 - 48 = 2 more 4's than 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. From 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. And 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times. So yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is only 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4's: 89, 8's: 0. So, difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each place:\n\n- Units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49. Difference: 0\n- Tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 48. Difference: +2\n- Hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0. Difference: +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make any errors.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nTotal pages: 488. Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place from 1-480 (since 480 / 10 = 48). Then, pages 481-488 have units digits 1-8, so digits 1-8 each get one more count. So, 4 and 8 each get 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nComplete hundreds: 4 sets (1-100, 101-200, etc.), each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40 each. Then, 401-488: tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. In this range, 4's tens digit occurs in 441-450 (10 times), and 8's tens digit occurs in 481-488 (8 times). So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 8 = 48 for 8's. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly 400-488 have hundreds digit 4, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's. 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nWait, that's the same as before, so that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check the total number of 4's and 8's again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nCalculating total 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place: 50\nHundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place: 48\nHundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 48 = 97\n\nSo, difference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. And 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times. So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 8 = 48 for 8's.\n\nUnits place: 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 and 8 each get one more, making 49 each.\n\nSo, yes, everything adds up. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in complete blocks of 10 pages.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Difference: 0\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in each block of 100 pages.\n   - Complete blocks (1-400) contribute 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - In 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n   - Difference: 2\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 never appears.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n   - Difference: 89\n\nSumming the differences:\n- Units: 0\n- Tens: +2\n- Hundreds: +89\n- Total: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in the range 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, the digit 4 appears once in the units place every 10 numbers. How many such sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, I think it's 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times 1 is 48. But wait, the last set would be 481-490, but since the book only goes up to 488, the units digit 4 in 484 would still be counted. So, actually, it's 48 full sets, but the last partial set from 481-488 still includes a 4 in the units place (484). So, that adds one more, making it 48 + 1 = 49 times 4 appears in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 40-49, which is 10 times. How many such sets are there in 488 pages? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these sets has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place, so 4 times 10 is 40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles again. So, in 401-410, tens digit is 0; 411-420 is 1, 421-430 is 2, 431-440 is 3, 441-450 is 4, but wait, 441-450 is actually 440-449? No, wait, 440-449 would be 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers. But 440 is part of 401-488, so yes, 440-449 is within 401-488. So that's another 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, total tens place 4's would be 4 sets times 10 plus 10 more, which is 50. Wait, but 4 sets (each 100 numbers) give 40, and then in the last partial set (401-488), we have another 10, so total 50. Hmm, but wait, 401-488 is 88 numbers, so 440-449 is 10 numbers, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, but each page number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4. So, that's 89 times. Wait, but 488 - 400 + 1 is 89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, how many full sets of 10 are there in 488? 488 /10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times 1 is 48. But wait, the last partial set is 481-488, which includes 488, so the units digit 8 appears once more. So, total units place 8's is 48 +1 =49.\n\nNext, the tens place. For the tens digit, every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each hundred. So, in each 100 numbers, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 80-89, which is 10 times. So, how many full hundreds are there in 488? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 times, so 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit cycles again. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 would be in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. So, total tens place 8's is 40 +9=49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1,2,3, or 4. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total 98. And 4's were 188. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. In the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. That's 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is included, and 488 is the last page. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 times. So, 4 full hundreds contributing 10 each, so 40, plus 9, total 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 4 full hundreds giving 10 each (40) plus 10 more, total 50. So, 50 in tens place.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 appears in hundreds place. So, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nAnd 8's: 49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can write a small table for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so 48+1=49.\n\n- Tens: floor(488/100)=4, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 488 mod 100=88, so how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's from 40-49 in the tens, so 40-49 is 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 88, 40-49 is within 401-488? Wait, no, 40-49 is in the first hundred. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to calculate for each digit place:\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's = floor(488/10) + (if 488 mod 10 >=4, add 1 else 0). So, 488/10=48.8, so floor is 48. 488 mod10=8, which is >=4, so 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for tens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's = floor(488/100) *10 + (if (488 mod 100) >=40, then (488 mod 100) -40 +1 else 0). So, floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. 488 mod100=88, which is >=40, so 88-40+1=49. Wait, but that can't be right because 40-49 is 10 numbers, so in the last partial hundred, it's 10 numbers, not 49. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, the formula for the tens digit is:\n\nFor each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so for each hundred, the number of times a specific digit (like 4) appears in the tens place is 10 times per hundred.\n\nBut in the last partial hundred, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in the last partial hundred, it's 10, not 49. So, perhaps the formula should be:\n\nNumber of 4's in tens place = (number of full hundreds)*10 + min(488 mod 100 - 40 +1, 10). Wait, no, because 488 mod 100 is 88, so 88-40+1=49, but that's not correct because in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, regardless of the upper limit.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nFor the tens digit, the number of times 4 appears is:\n\nEach full hundred contributes 10 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). Then, in the last partial hundred, if the tens digit is >=4, we add the numbers from 40-49 in that hundred, but since the upper limit is 488, the last partial hundred is 401-488. So, in the tens place, the 4's would be from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's is 4*10 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for the units digit, it's 49.\n\nAnd hundreds digit is 89.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits digit: same as 4's, 49.\n\nTens digit: each full hundred contributes 10 times (80-89). So, 4*10=40. In the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds digit: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nThus, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 488 mod100 is 88, so 88-80+1=9, which is correct for the tens place 8's in the last partial hundred.\n\nSo, yes, 49 8's in units, 49 in tens, total 98.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is calculated by examining each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place for 4's**:\n   - Every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - Total sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full sets and a partial set.\n   - Each full set contributes 1, so 48 \u00d7 1 = 48.\n   - In the partial set (481-488), 484 contributes 1 more.\n   - Total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place for 4's**:\n   - Every 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49).\n   - Total full hundreds: 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400).\n   - Each contributes 10, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - In the last partial hundred (401-488), 440-449 contributes another 10.\n   - Total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place for 4's**:\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers.\n   - Total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\n**Total 4's**: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n\n1. **Units Place for 8's**:\n   - Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers contribute 1.\n   - Total units place 8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place for 8's**:\n   - Every 100 numbers, 80-89 contribute 10.\n   - Total full hundreds: 4, contributing 40.\n   - In the last partial hundred (401-488), 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place for 8's**:\n   - No occurrence as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's**: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference**: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nFirst, the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, that's only up to 480. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again in the units place. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers, and each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? From 1 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So that's 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 4 appears 187 times.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, from 1 to 488, does 8 appear 48 times in the units place? Let me check: the last page is 488, so the units digit goes up to 8, so in 488, the units digit is 8, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, 488 is 488, so units digit 8 occurs once in each 10, so 48 times up to 480, and then one more in 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, units place: 49.\n\nTens place: Similarly, the tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. So, each of the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 4 ranges \u00d7 10 = 40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier, when counting 4's, I got 187, and 8's as 98, so the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89. But let me double-check my counting for 8's because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the tens place, the ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So that's five ranges. Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40. The last range, 480-488, is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nUnits place: From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8. Then, in the last partial cycle, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nSo, number of 4's is 187, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I added up the 4's, I had units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 187. Let me confirm the tens place for 4's: The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, 187 4's and 98 8's. So, the difference is 89. Therefore, 4's are printed 89 more times than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full cycles of 10 in 488, plus one more in 488, totaling 49 occurrences. However, since 488 ends with 8, the units digit 4 appears 48 times (from 4, 14, ..., 484).\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each range (40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full cycles, plus one more in 488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each range (80-89, 180-189, etc.), with the last range being 480-488 (9 numbers). Totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll go through each position one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. Units place:\n   - For the units place, the digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, in the range 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n   - Well, from 1 to 488, every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many such blocks are there?\n   - Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n   - In each block, 4 appears once, so 48 times from the complete blocks. Now, in the last partial block (481-488), does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see: 484 is the only number where units digit is 4. So, that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place:\n   - Now, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - How many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n   - Let's see, the first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), the next is 140-149, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks in total.\n   - Each block contributes 10 instances of the digit 4 in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n   - But wait, does the last block go beyond 488? The last block would be 440-449, which is within 488, so no issue. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n   - Now, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that?\n   - From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again. From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, yes, that's correct. So, 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 8:\n\n1. Units place:\n   - Similar to the 4's, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n   - Again, each block of 10 has one 8. So, 48 complete blocks (1-480) and then 8 more numbers (481-488).\n   - In each block, 8 appears once, so 48 times. In the last partial block, 488 is the only number where units digit is 8. So, that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place:\n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - How many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n   - Let's see: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but 480-489 would go up to 489, but our book ends at 488. So, does the block 480-489 count? Well, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the digit 8 in the tens place is from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers, but each of those has 8 in the tens place. Wait, no, actually, from 480 to 489, the tens digit is 8, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, how many complete blocks do we have?\n   - Let's list them: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 complete blocks and one partial block.\n   - Each complete block contributes 10 instances, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. The partial block contributes 9 instances. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but hold on, in the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for all numbers from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n   - The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8. So, each block of 100 has one block where the tens digit is 8, which is 10 numbers. So, from 1-488, how many such blocks are there?\n\n- 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers)\n- 101-200: 180-189 (10)\n- 201-300: 280-289 (10)\n- 301-400: 380-389 (10)\n- 401-488: 480-488 (9 numbers)\n\nSo, that's 4 complete blocks (each contributing 10) and one partial block contributing 9. So, total is 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, each of those has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place of 4, I had 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5\u00d710=50. That's correct.\n\nUnits place for 4: 49 times. Yes, because 488/10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, and then one more in 484. So, 49.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 49, tens place:49, so total 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again, because sometimes when counting the hundreds place, I might have included an extra. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: For the hundreds digit, only 400-488 have 4, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nFor the tens digit, as I did before, 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 4's.\n\nUnits digit: 49.\n\nTotal 4's: 89 + 50 + 49 = 188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, hundreds digit: 0.\n\nTens digit: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\nUnits digit: 48 full blocks (each 10 numbers) plus 488, so 49.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. When counting the tens place for 8's, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but does each of those have an 8 in the tens place? Let me confirm. 480: 8 in tens place, 481: 8, ..., up to 488: 8. So yes, 9 numbers, so 9 instances. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's in the tens place, the last block is 440-449, which is 10 numbers, all within 488, so that's correct.\n\nI think that's thorough. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears is calculated by considering each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately. Similarly, the digit 8 is counted in each position. The counts are as follows:\n\n- **4's:**\n  - Units place: 49 times\n  - Tens place: 50 times\n  - Hundreds place: 89 times\n  - Total: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n- **8's:**\n  - Units place: 49 times\n  - Tens place: 49 times\n  - Hundreds place: 0 times\n  - Total: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, from 1 to 480, that's 480 numbers, which is 48 groups of 10. So, 48 times 1, which is 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again in the units place after 480. So, total 4's in the units place: 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4, so that's 10 times. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88. So, from 1 to 400, there are 4 sets of 100. Each set contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40. Now, from 400 to 488, the tens digit is 0-8, so the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is another 10 times. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49: 10 numbers. Similarly, 101-200: 140-149, another 10. 201-300: 240-249, another 10. 301-400: 340-349, another 10. So, up to 400, that's 4 x 10 = 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 more. So, yes, 50 in total.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so yes, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is the sum of units, tens, and hundreds places: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that. 48 + 50 is 98, and 98 + 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that's 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is the last number, so the units digit goes up to 8, so that's 488. So, from 1 to 488, the units digit 8 appears 48 times? Wait, no, because 488 is included, so 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that would be the 49th time. Wait, let me think. From 1 to 480, that's 480 numbers, which is 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more in 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers. So, from 1-400, how many sets of 100 are there? 4 sets, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 x 10 = 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place from 400-488. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1-100, 80-89: 10 numbers. 101-200: 180-189: 10. 201-300: 280-289: 10. 301-400: 380-389: 10. So, up to 400, that's 4 x 10 = 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 more, making it 49 in total.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Units: 49, tens: 49, so 49 + 49 = 98. That seems right.\n\nWait, but earlier, for 4's, I had 187, and for 8's, I have 98. So, the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's. Units place: from 1 to 488, how many 4's in units? Every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the 480-488 range, units digit is 0-8, so 4 doesn't appear again. So, units: 48.\n\nTens place: From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's: Units place: From 1-480, 48 times, then 488 adds one more, so 49.\n\nTens place: From 1-400, 40 times, then from 400-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 more, totaling 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I just thought, in the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's there.\n\nBut for 8's, in the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 8's in the tens place there.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the 8's in the tens place. So, from 1-400, in each hundred, 80-89, 180-189, etc., so 4 sets, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more, totaling 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: For the tens digit, how many times does 8 appear? Let's see, from 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each 100, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 full hundreds would give 4 x 10 = 40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the units digit, 8 appears once every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus one more in 488, making 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, 4's: 187, 8's: 98, difference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the 4's correctly in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's. That seems right.\n\nAnother way to check: Let's calculate the total number of digits printed. But maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each position again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units place for 8's. Let me recount. From 1 to 488, how many 8's in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But since 488 is included, which is 480 + 8, so the units digit 8 appears in 488 as well, so that's the 49th time. So, 49 units place 8's.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, as before, 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 98.\n\nAnd 4's: 187.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 4's in units: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187.\n\n8's in units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98.\n\nSo, yes, 187-98=89.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10, contributing 48 instances.\n   - Total: 48.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100.\n   - From 1 to 400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 instances, totaling 40.\n   - From 400 to 488, 440-449 adds another 10.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 480, there are 48 instances.\n   - 488 adds one more.\n   - Total: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100.\n   - From 1 to 400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 instances, totaling 40.\n   - From 400 to 488, 480-488 adds 9 instances.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, for the units place: In every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, etc. So, from 1 to 488, how many such blocks are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). Each full block contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. The partial block (481-488) doesn't include a 4 in the units place because the units digits go from 1 to 8, and 4 is included once, but wait, 484 would have a 4 in the units place. Wait, no, 484 is 4 in the hundreds, 8 in the tens, and 4 in the units. So, in the partial block, the units digit 4 appears once. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, in every block of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. From 1 to 488, how many full hundreds are there? There are four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes 10 times 4 in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens place can be 0-8. So, 401-409: tens digit is 0, 410-419: tens digit is 1, ..., 480-488: tens digit is 8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488. So, that's another 10 times. So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: In the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in the numbers 400-488. How many times? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400 to 488 inclusive. So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, in every block of 10, 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, as before, 48 full blocks and a partial block of 8. Each full block gives one 8, so 48. The partial block is 481-488, which includes 488, so the units digit 8 appears once here. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: In every block of 100, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place, e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc. From 1 to 488, there are four full hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 times. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but 480 is included, so that's 9 instances. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: From 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 8, it's 480-488. But 480 is 4 8 0, so yes, tens digit is 8. So, how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. So, total 98.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4's, I had 188, and for 8's, 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nBut let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place: From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial ten, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For 4's, in each hundred, 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributes 10 times. There are four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\nUnits place: Same as 4's, 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last partial ten, 481-488, includes 488, so units digit 8 appears once. So, total 49.\n\nTens place: In each hundred, 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributes 10 times. Four full hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 9. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: As before, 800-899, but we only go up to 488, so 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when counting the hundreds place, I might have made a mistake. For 4's, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, correct. For 8's, hundreds place is 0, correct.\n\nAnother way to check: Let me calculate the total number of digits printed and see if the counts make sense.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to recount the tens place for 8's. In the range 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times 8 in the tens place. So, 40 (from the four hundreds) + 9 = 49, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, in 401-488, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 in the tens place, correct.\n\nSo, I think my counts are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so 188 - 98 = 90 more 4's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, the units place. For every ten numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in every block of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4). In 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. So, to find out how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48 full blocks of ten, and then there's a remainder of 8. Each block contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, the last block is 481-488, so the units digit goes up to 8, which means 484 is included, so that's one more 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). Since we're going up to 488, there are four full hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and then 400-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the fifth hundred, but only up to 488. Let me correct that: the first hundred is 1-99, then 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? In each full hundred, it's 10 times. So, from 1-399, that's four hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 0 for 400-409, 1 for 410-419, and so on up to 8 for 480-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Well, when the tens digit is 4, that's 440-449, which is 10 pages. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 more. So, total tens place 4's would be 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Let me check again. From 1-399, each hundred contributes 10 times 4 in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so that's 10 more. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these page numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times.\n\nWait, but actually, the hundreds digit is only 4 for 400-499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, every block of ten numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full blocks of ten are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial block, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (page 488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. Again, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times. So, in each hundred, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89). From 1-399, that's four hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place here? It's in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because in 400-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, when the tens digit is 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 9 times. Therefore, total tens place 8's: 40 (from 1-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nTherefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full decades (1-480), each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in 481-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 484 is included, adding one more, so 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred contributes 10 times, so 4 hundreds (1-399) contribute 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 times, so total 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, 488 adds one more, so 49.\n\n- Tens place: 4 hundreds contribute 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9. Total 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** Every block of 10 numbers contributes one 4. There are 48 full blocks (1-480) and one more in 481-488 (484), totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** Each hundred contributes 10 fours. From 1-399, it's 40. From 400-488, 440-449 adds 10, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 400-488 contributes 89 fours.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to 4's, 48 full blocks and one in 488, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** Each hundred contributes 10 eights. From 1-399, it's 40. From 400-488, 480-488 adds 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No eights as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Difference = Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by separating the problem into single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit page numbers. Maybe that will make it easier to count the occurrences of 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: 1 to 9. In this range, the digits are 1 through 9. So, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once. That's straightforward.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I think I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place separately.\n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers: The tens digit can be from 1 to 9. So, for each tens digit, there are 10 possible units digits (0-9). Now, I need to find how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\n- For 4 in the tens place: The numbers would be 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n- For 8 in the tens place: The numbers would be 80-89. That's another 10 numbers, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers: The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each tens digit. So, for each tens digit (1-9), the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for 8.\n\n- For 4 in the units place: There are 9 tens digits (1-9), so 4 appears 9 times.\n- For 8 in the units place: Similarly, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, let me check that. For example, in the 10's, units digits go from 0-9, so 14 has a 4 in the units place. Similarly, 24, 34, ..., 94. That's 9 times. Same for 8's: 18, 28, ..., 98. So, 9 times each.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers:\n- 4's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n- 8's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So, in two-digit numbers, the count for 4's and 8's is the same.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because there are three places: hundreds, tens, and units. Let me break this down by each digit place.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\n- For 4 in the hundreds place: That would be pages 400 to 488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n- For 8 in the hundreds place: Wait, the hundreds digit can only be up to 4 because the book ends at 488. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers: The tens digit can be 0-9, and the units digit can be 0-9. But we have to consider that when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens and units digits go up to 88 (since the book ends at 488). So, let's separate this into two parts: hundreds digits 1-3 and hundreds digit 4.\n\nFor hundreds digits 1-3 (100-399):\n- The tens digit can be 0-9, and the units digit can be 0-9. So, for each hundreds digit (1,2,3), we have 10 possibilities for tens and 10 for units, making 100 numbers per hundreds digit. But we're interested in how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\n- For 4 in the tens place: For each hundreds digit (1,2,3), when the tens digit is 4, the units can be 0-9, so 10 numbers per hundreds digit. So, 3 hundreds digits \u00d7 10 = 30 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n- Similarly, for 8 in the tens place: Same logic, 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 times.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4 (400-488):\n- The tens digit can be 0-8 because the book ends at 488. So, tens digits are 0-8, and units digits are 0-9, except when the tens digit is 8, units can only go up to 8.\n\nWait, maybe I should handle this more carefully. Let me think.\n\nWhen the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can be 0-8, but when the tens digit is 8, the units digit can only be 0-8, because 488 is the last page. So, let me calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nFirst, for 4 in the tens place:\n- Tens digit is 4, units can be 0-9. So, numbers 440-449. That's 10 numbers. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place:\n- Tens digit is 8, units can be 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, numbers 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For 8 in the tens place, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is included.\n\nSo, in the tens place for hundreds digit 4:\n- 4's: 10\n- 8's: 9\n\nNow, let's sum up the tens place for three-digit numbers:\n- 4's: 30 (from hundreds 1-3) + 10 (from hundreds 4) = 40\n- 8's: 30 (from hundreds 1-3) + 9 (from hundreds 4) = 39\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check again. For hundreds 1-3, each has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4, so 3\u00d710=30. Similarly, for 8 in tens place, 3\u00d710=30. Then, for hundreds digit 4, tens digit 4 adds 10, and tens digit 8 adds 9. So, total 4's in tens place: 30+10=40, and 8's: 30+9=39.\n\nOkay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, let's separate into hundreds digits 1-3 and 4.\n\nFor hundreds digits 1-3:\n- The units digit cycles from 0-9 for each combination of hundreds and tens digits. So, for each hundreds digit (1,2,3), there are 10 possibilities for tens and 10 for units, making 100 numbers. So, for each hundreds digit, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the units place (e.g., 104,114,...,194 for hundreds digit 1), and similarly for 8.\n\n- So, for 4's in units place: 3 hundreds digits \u00d7 10 = 30\n- For 8's in units place: 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n\nFor hundreds digit 4:\n- The units digit can be 0-9 except when the tens digit is 8, in which case units go up to 8.\n\nWait, but actually, the units digit is independent except when the tens digit is 8. Hmm, maybe it's better to consider separately.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to think that for hundreds digit 4, the units digit can be 0-9 for most tens digits, except when the tens digit is 8, where units go up to 8.\n\nSo, for units digit 4 in hundreds digit 4:\n- For each tens digit (0-8), units digit 4 appears once. So, tens digits 0-7: 8 digits, each contributing one 4 in units place. Then, for tens digit 8, units digit 4 is allowed because 484 is within 488. So, that's 9 tens digits (0-8), each contributing one 4 in units place. So, 9 times.\n\nWait, but 484 is within 488, so yes, units digit 4 appears once in each tens group, including when tens digit is 8. So, 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, for units digit 8 in hundreds digit 4:\n- For each tens digit (0-7), units digit 8 appears once. That's 8 times. For tens digit 8, units digit can go up to 8, so 488 is included, so units digit 8 appears once more. So, total 9 times.\n\nWait, let me check that. For hundreds digit 4, the page numbers go up to 488.\n\nSo, for units digit 4:\n- When tens digit is 0: 404\n- Tens 1: 414\n- ...\n- Tens 8: 484\nSo, that's 9 times.\n\nFor units digit 8:\n- When tens digit is 0: 408\n- Tens 1: 418\n- ...\n- Tens 7: 478\n- Tens 8: 488\nSo, that's 8 (from tens 0-7) + 1 (tens 8) = 9 times.\n\nWait, but when tens digit is 8, units digit can only go up to 8, so 488 is included, which has units digit 8. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, for hundreds digit 4:\n- Units digit 4: 9 times\n- Units digit 8: 9 times\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that for hundreds digits 1-3, units digit 4 and 8 each appear 10 times. So, adding up:\n\nFor units place in three-digit numbers:\n- 4's: 30 (from 1-3) + 9 (from 4) = 39\n- 8's: 30 (from 1-3) + 9 (from 4) = 39\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, for hundreds digits 1-3, each has 10 numbers where units digit is 4, so 3\u00d710=30. Similarly for 8's. Then, for hundreds digit 4, units digit 4 appears 9 times, and 8's also 9 times. So, total 4's in units place: 30+9=39, and 8's: 30+9=39.\n\nWait, but that would mean in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal. But let me check with an example. For hundreds digit 4, units digit 4 appears in 404,414,...,484, which is 9 times. Similarly, units digit 8 appears in 408,418,...,488, which is also 9 times. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I thought about units digit 8 in hundreds digit 4, I considered that when tens digit is 8, units can go up to 8, so 488 is included, making it 9 times. So, yes, 9 times for both 4 and 8 in units place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, putting it all together for three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's:\n  - Hundreds place: 89\n  - Tens place: 40\n  - Units place: 39\n  Total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n\n- 8's:\n  - Hundreds place: 0\n  - Tens place: 39\n  - Units place: 39\n  Total: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nWait, let me check that calculation again.\n\nWait, for 4's in three-digit numbers:\n- Hundreds: 89\n- Tens: 40\n- Units: 39\nTotal: 89 + 40 = 129 + 39 = 168\n\nFor 8's in three-digit numbers:\n- Hundreds: 0\n- Tens: 39\n- Units: 39\nTotal: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences across single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nFirst, single-digit:\n- 4's: 1\n- 8's: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n- 4's: 19\n- 8's: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n- 4's: 168\n- 8's: 78\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nWait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 = 90, which seems like a big difference. Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me go back step by step.\n\nSingle-digit:\n- 4 appears once (page 4)\n- 8 appears once (page 8)\n\nTwo-digit:\n- Tens place for 4: 10 (40-49)\n- Units place for 4: 9 (14,24,...,94)\nTotal 4's: 19\n\n- Tens place for 8: 10 (80-89)\n- Units place for 8: 9 (18,28,...,98)\nTotal 8's: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears in 400-488: 89 times\n- 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place\n\nTens place:\n- Hundreds 1-3: 3\u00d710=30 for 4's and 30 for 8's\n- Hundreds 4:\n  - 4's: 10 (440-449)\n  - 8's: 9 (480-488)\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 30 + 10 = 40\nTotal 8's in tens place: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nUnits place:\n- Hundreds 1-3: 3\u00d710=30 for 4's and 30 for 8's\n- Hundreds 4:\n  - 4's: 9 (404,414,...,484)\n  - 8's: 9 (408,418,...,488)\nSo, total 4's in units place: 30 + 9 = 39\nTotal 8's in units place: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nSo, three-digit 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\nThree-digit 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nAdding up all page numbers:\n4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 1 + 19 = 20 + 168 = 188\n8's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 1 + 19 = 20 + 78 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check if I counted correctly in three-digit numbers, especially for units place in hundreds digit 4.\n\nWait, when hundreds digit is 4, units digit 4 appears in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 times, correct.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8 appears in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 times, correct.\n\nSo, units place in hundreds digit 4: 9 for 4's and 9 for 8's.\n\nSo, yes, 39 each in units place.\n\nWait, but 30 from hundreds 1-3 and 9 from 4, so 39 each. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When hundreds digit is 4, the units digit 4 appears 9 times, and units digit 8 appears 9 times. So, 39 each. So, yes.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for hundreds digit 4, 4's appear 10 times (440-449) and 8's appear 9 times (480-488). So, 40 and 39 respectively.\n\nSo, 4's in three-digit: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n8's in three-digit: 39 + 39 = 78\n\nAdding single and two-digit:\n4's: 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 168 = 188\n8's: 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 78 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Maybe I made a mistake in the three-digit counts.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately across all page numbers.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nFirst, for each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, for each complete set of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n\nTotal number of complete tens in 488 pages: 488 / 10 = 48 complete tens, with 8 remaining numbers (481-488).\n\nSo, in units place, 4 appears 48 times for each digit, plus check the remaining 8 numbers.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Actually, for each ten, the units digit cycles 0-9, so 4 appears once per ten. So, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. The number of complete tens is 48 (since 48\u00d710=480), and then 8 more numbers (481-488).\n\nIn each complete ten, units digit 4 appears once. So, 48 times.\n\nIn the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484).\n\nSo, total units digit 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8's:\n\nIn each complete ten, 8 appears once. So, 48 times.\n\nIn the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), units digit 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo, total units digit 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier count. Wait, earlier I had 39 for three-digit units place, but this method is giving me 49. So, I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps my earlier approach was wrong because I separated hundreds digits and didn't account for all possibilities correctly.\n\nLet me try this method for all digit places.\n\nUnits place:\n\nAs above, 4's: 49, 8's: 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nSimilarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more numbers (401-488).\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\nSo, for 4 hundreds, 4's in tens place: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40\n8's in tens place: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40\n\nNow, for the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), which is 400-488, but we've already counted up to 400. Wait, no, 401-488 is 88 numbers. So, in these 88 numbers, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page).\n\nSo, in the tens place for 401-488:\n- Tens digits: 0-8 (since 488 is the end)\n- For each tens digit, the units can be 0-9 except when the tens digit is 8, where units go up to 8.\n\nSo, for 4's in tens place:\n- Tens digit 4: occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times.\n\nFor 8's in tens place:\n- Tens digit 8: occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total tens digit 4's: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50\nTotal tens digit 8's: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49\n\nWait, but that doesn't align with the previous calculation. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, let's think differently. The total number of times a digit appears in the tens place up to 488 can be calculated as:\n\nFor each digit d in 0-9, the number of times it appears in the tens place is:\n\n- For d < 4: (4) hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40\n- For d = 4: (4) hundreds \u00d7 10 + 10 (since in the 400s, 440-449)\n- For d = 8: (4) hundreds \u00d7 10 + 9 (since in the 400s, 480-488)\n- For d > 8: Not applicable since we go up to 488.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite accurate. Let me try to compute it properly.\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to N can be calculated as:\n\n- For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times, so for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times.\n\nSo, for 4 complete hundreds (1-400), each digit appears 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times.\n\nThen, from 401-488, which is 88 numbers, the tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n\nSo, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear?\n\n- For tens digits 0-7: Each appears 10 times (e.g., 400-409, 410-419, etc.)\n- For tens digit 8: Appears 9 times (480-488)\n\nSo, for tens digit 4 in 401-488: 10 times (440-449)\nFor tens digit 8 in 401-488: 9 times (480-488)\n\nSo, total tens digit 4's: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 = 50\nTotal tens digit 8's: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 = 49\n\nSo, in the tens place:\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 49\n\nNow, units place:\n\nAs calculated earlier, units digit 4's: 49\nUnits digit 8's: 49\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's.\nFrom 100-488: hundreds digits are 1,2,3,4.\n\n- 4's in hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488-400+1=89)\n- 8's in hundreds place: 0, since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nNow, summing up all digit places:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that's the same result as before. So, maybe my initial approach was correct, and the difference is indeed 90. But let me just make sure.\n\nWait, when I calculated using the per-digit approach, I got 4's: 188, 8's: 98, difference 90.\n\nAlternatively, when I used the per-page approach, I also got the same numbers. So, perhaps 90 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me just check the units place again because earlier I thought it was 39, but with this method, it's 49. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach by not considering all the numbers correctly.\n\nWait, in the initial approach, for three-digit numbers, I considered units digit 4's as 39, but with this method, it's 49. So, I must have missed 10 occurrences in the initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps because in the initial approach, I only considered three-digit numbers, but in reality, the units digit 4's include both single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, no, in the initial approach, I separated single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit, and counted each separately. So, in single-digit, units digit 4 appears once, in two-digit, units digit 4 appears 9 times, and in three-digit, 39 times, totaling 1 + 9 + 39 = 49, which matches the per-digit approach.\n\nWait, yes, in the initial approach, I had:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (4)\nTwo-digit: 9 (14,24,...,94)\nThree-digit: 39 (from hundreds 1-3:30 and hundreds 4:9)\nTotal: 1 + 9 + 39 = 49, which matches the per-digit method.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (8)\nTwo-digit: 9 (18,28,...,98)\nThree-digit: 39 (from hundreds 1-3:30 and hundreds 4:9)\nTotal: 1 + 9 + 39 = 49, which also matches.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me just think again: 188 - 98 = 90. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another method to verify.\n\nAnother way is to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place across all page numbers.\n\nLet's consider each digit place separately:\n\n1. Units place:\n   - As calculated, 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\n2. Tens place:\n   - 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n   - 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first did the per-digit approach, I thought the units digit for 4's was 49, which includes single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers, but in the initial approach, I separated them and added correctly.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 90.\n\nWait, but let me just check with a smaller example to see if the method is correct.\n\nSuppose we have a book with page numbers from 1 to 20. Let's count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nSingle-digit:\n- 4:1, 8:1\n\nTwo-digit:\n- 4's: 14, 40-49 (but wait, up to 20, so only 14 and 24? No, up to 20, so 14 is the only two-digit number with 4 in units place. 40-49 are beyond 20, so not included.\n\nWait, so in 1-20:\n\n4's:\n- Units place: 4,14 => 2 times\n- Tens place: 40-49 not included, so 0\nTotal: 2\n\n8's:\n- Units place: 8,18 => 2 times\n- Tens place: 80-89 not included, so 0\nTotal: 2\n\nDifference: 0\n\nWait, but according to my method:\n\nUnits place: 20 / 10 = 2 complete tens, so 2 4's and 2 8's.\n\nTens place: For 1-20, the tens digit is 1 for 10-19, and 0 for 1-9. So, 4's in tens place: 0, 8's in tens place: 0.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 2, 8's: 2, difference 0. Correct.\n\nAnother example: 1-100.\n\nUnits place:\n- 4's: 10 (4,14,...,94)\n- 8's:10 (8,18,...,98)\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: 10 (40-49)\n- 8's: 10 (80-89)\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 0 (since 100 is the end, but 100 doesn't have a 4 in hundreds place)\n- 8's:0\n\nTotal 4's:10+10=20\nTotal 8's:10+10=20\nDifference:0\n\nWhich is correct because in 1-100, 4's and 8's are equal.\n\nWait, but in 1-488, we have more 4's than 8's because 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times, while 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place at all.\n\nSo, the difference is 89 in hundreds place, plus the difference in tens and units place.\n\nWait, in the tens place, 4's:50, 8's:49, so difference +1\nIn units place, 4's:49, 8's:49, difference 0\n\nSo, total difference: 89 +1 =90\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Single-Digit Page Numbers (1-9):**\n   - '4' appears once (page 4).\n   - '8' appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-Digit Page Numbers (10-99):**\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - '4' appears 10 times (40-49).\n     - '8' appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - '4' appears 9 times (14, 24, ..., 94).\n     - '8' appears 9 times (18, 28, ..., 98).\n   - **Total for Two-Digits:**\n     - '4': 10 + 9 = 19.\n     - '8': 10 + 9 = 19.\n\n3. **Three-Digit Page Numbers (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - '4' appears 89 times (400-488).\n     - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - **Hundreds 1-3:** Each contributes 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the tens place.\n       - Total: 3\u00d710 = 30 for both '4' and '8'.\n     - **Hundreds 4:**\n       - '4' appears 10 times (440-449).\n       - '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n     - **Total for Tens Place:**\n       - '4': 30 + 10 = 40.\n       - '8': 30 + 9 = 39.\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - **Hundreds 1-3:** Each contributes 10 '4's and 10 '8's.\n       - Total: 3\u00d710 = 30 for both '4' and '8'.\n     - **Hundreds 4:**\n       - '4' appears 9 times (404, 414, ..., 484).\n       - '8' appears 9 times (408, 418, ..., 488).\n     - **Total for Units Place:**\n       - '4': 30 + 9 = 39.\n       - '8': 30 + 9 = 39.\n   - **Total for Three-Digits:**\n     - '4': 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n     - '8': 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\n4"

    "text": " Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll do this for both 4 and 8. Maybe I can make a table or something to keep track, but since I'm just thinking it through, I'll try to visualize it.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each set of ten numbers. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits go from 1 to 0, so each digit 0-9 appears once every ten numbers. But wait, actually, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit 0-9 appears once every ten numbers. So, if I can figure out how many complete sets of ten there are in 488, I can calculate how many times each digit appears in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears ten times in each block of a hundred numbers. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, each digit in the tens place appears 10 times. Similarly, for the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 4 appears 100 times each in the hundreds place for a 488-page book because 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. So, the hundreds digit is 1 from 100-199, 2 from 200-299, 3 from 300-399, and 4 from 400-488. So, each hundreds digit appears 100 times except for 4, which appears only 88 times because 400-488 is 89 numbers, but wait, 488 minus 400 is 88, but since we include both 400 and 488, it's 89 numbers. Hmm, so actually, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times, not 100. I might have made a mistake earlier. So, I need to correct that.\n\nWait, no, actually, from 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? Let's see, 488 minus 400 is 88, but since both endpoints are included, it's 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. But for the other hundreds digits, like 1, 2, 3, they each appear 100 times because 100-199 is 100 numbers, 200-299 is another 100, and 300-399 is another 100. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times, while 1, 2, 3 each appear 100 times.\n\nWait, but when counting digits, do we include page 1 as having a hundreds digit of 0? Because page 1 is just '1', so it doesn't have a hundreds digit. Hmm, maybe I should consider that the hundreds digit is only present from page 100 onwards. So, for pages 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's not counted. So, when counting the hundreds digit, only pages 100-488 have a hundreds digit, which is 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nSo, let's break down the counting for each digit position.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's and 8's in the units place.\n\nUnits place:\nEach digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers. So, in 488 pages, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then, there are 8 remaining numbers (481-488), which are 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, in the units place of these 8 numbers, the digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in the units place, we have one more 4 and one more 8.\n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 48*1 +1 =49\nTotal 8's in units place:48*1 +1=49\n\nWait, but let me check. From 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the units place?\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place for the complete sets of 10, and then in the remaining 8 numbers, digits 1-8 appear once each, so digits 4 and 8 each appear once more. So, total for units place: 48+1=49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nWait, but wait, 0 doesn't appear in the remaining 8 numbers because the remaining numbers are 481-488, which end with 1-8, so 0 doesn't appear in the units place in the incomplete set. So, yes, 4 and 8 each get an extra count.\n\nSo, units place: 4's =49, 8's=49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nTens place:\nEach digit 0-9 appears 10 times in each block of 100 numbers. So, for example, in 0-99, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. But wait, in 1-99, the tens digit is 0 for pages 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, etc., up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each block of 100.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? There are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then the last block is 401-488.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 numbers, so that's not a full block of 100. So, in each complete block of 100, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 complete blocks, that's 4*10=40 times each digit in the tens place. Now, in the incomplete block from 401-488, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place?\n\nWait, 401-488 is 88 numbers. Let's see, the tens digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 401-410, tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit is 1; 421-430, tens digit is 2; 431-440, tens digit is 3; 441-450, tens digit is 4; 451-460, tens digit is 5; 461-470, tens digit is 6; 471-480, tens digit is 7; and 481-488, tens digit is 8.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 481-488 is 8 numbers: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, the tens digit here is 8 for all these numbers, right? Wait, no, 481-489 would have tens digit 8, but since we're only going up to 488, it's still 8 for all. So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears a certain number of times in the incomplete block.\n\nWait, but let's calculate how many times each tens digit appears in 401-488.\n\n- Tens digit 0: 401-410: that's 10 numbers, but 401-410 is 10 pages, so tens digit 0 appears 10 times.\n- Tens digit 1: 411-420: 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n- Tens digit 2: 421-430: 10 times.\n- Tens digit 3: 431-440: 10 times.\n- Tens digit 4: 441-450: 10 times.\n- Tens digit 5: 451-460: 10 times.\n- Tens digit 6: 461-470: 10 times.\n- Tens digit 7: 471-480: 10 times.\n- Tens digit 8: 481-488: 8 numbers, so 8 times.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 numbers, which is 8*10 + 8, but that adds up to 88. Wait, 401-488 is 88 pages, so each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for 8, which appears 8 times.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because 401-488 is 88 numbers, which is 8 full decades (each of 10 numbers) and then 8 more numbers. So, the first 80 numbers (401-480) would have each tens digit from 0 to 7 appearing 10 times each, and then the last 8 numbers (481-488) have tens digit 8 appearing 8 times.\n\nWait, but 401-480 is 80 numbers, which is 8 sets of 10, so each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears exactly 10 times each. Then, 481-488 is 8 numbers, so tens digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, in the incomplete block (401-488), the tens digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, in the incomplete block, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place?\n\n- For 4: it's in the tens place from 441-450, which is 10 times.\n- For 8: it's in the tens place from 481-488, which is 8 times.\n\nSo, in the incomplete block, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place overall:\n\n- For 4: 4 complete blocks * 10 times each (since in each block, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place) = 4*10=40, plus 10 times in the incomplete block, so total 50 times.\n- For 8: 4 complete blocks *10 times each = 40, plus 8 times in the incomplete block, so total 48 times.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 48 times.\n\nWait, but let me check again. In each complete block of 100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place per block. So, 4 blocks would give 4*10=40. Then, in the incomplete block, 4 appears another 10 times in the tens place (from 441-450), so total 50 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place: 4 blocks give 4*10=40, plus in the incomplete block, 8 appears 8 times in the tens place (from 481-488), so total 48 times.\n\nWait, but let me think again: in the incomplete block, the tens digit 8 appears only in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times. So, yes, 48 times in total for 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, units place: 4's=49, 8's=49\nTens place: 4's=50, 8's=48\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nHundreds place:\nAs I thought earlier, the hundreds digit is only present from page 100 onwards. So, pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit, so they don't contribute to the hundreds place count.\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so 100 times.\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, 100 times.\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, 100 times.\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, 89 times (since 488-400+1=89).\n\nSo, for the hundreds place, how many times does 4 and 8 appear?\n\nWell, 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the highest page is 488, so the hundreds digit can't be 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n4's=89\n8's=0\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor 4's:\nUnits place:49\nTens place:50\nHundreds place:89\nTotal 4's=49+50+89= 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor 8's:\nUnits place:49\nTens place:48\nHundreds place:0\nTotal 8's=49+48=97.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. Therefore, the difference is 188-97=91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big difference, and I might have made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let's go through each step again to make sure.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place (since 488//10=48), and then in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), digits 1-8 each appear once. So, 4 and 8 each get an extra count, so units place: 48+1=49 each.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nIn each block of 100, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 blocks (1-400) give 4*10=40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place. Then, in the incomplete block 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, total for 4:40+10=50, for 8:40+8=48.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188\nTotal 8's:49+48=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, how many numbers is that? 488-400=88, but since both 400 and 488 are included, it's 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nWait, but 400 is the first page with hundreds digit 4, and 488 is the last, so yes, 89 times.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, 8 never appears because the book only goes up to 488. So, 8's in hundreds place:0.\n\nSo, the total counts are correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I added correctly.\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens)=99, plus 89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units)+48 (tens)=97.\n\nSo, 188-97=91.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 91 seems like a lot, but maybe that's correct.\n\nWait, let me think differently: how many 4's and 8's are there in each position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of 4's and 8's by considering each digit position separately.\n\nWait, another approach: for each position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nAs before, 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 4 and 8 each appear once. So, 48+1=49 for both.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, in 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, 40+10=50 for 4, 40+8=48 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly 4 appears 89 times.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's:49+50+89=188\n8's:49+48=97\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me try a smaller example to see if my method works. Suppose I have a 20-page book. How many 1's and 2's are there?\n\nWait, maybe that's too small, but let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps a 30-page book. Let's count the number of 1's and 2's.\n\nBut maybe that's time-consuming. Alternatively, let's see if the method is correct.\n\nWait, another way: the total number of digits printed is 488 pages, each page number is 1, 2, or 3 digits. So, the total number of digits is 9 (1-9) + 90*2 (10-99) + 399*3 (100-488). Wait, but maybe that's not necessary here.\n\nWait, but in any case, the method seems correct: count each digit in each position separately.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just check once more.\n\nUnits place:\n\n488//10=48, so 48 times each digit 0-9 appears in units place, plus in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), digits 1-8 appear once each. So, 4 and 8 each get an extra count, so 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach block of 100 contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place. So, 4 blocks (1-400) give 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, in 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, 40+10=50 for 4, 40+8=48 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188\nTotal 8's:49+48=97\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, from 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's 89 times, as each number from 400 to 488 has 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the tens place again. In the incomplete block 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times. So, yes, 8 times.\n\nWait, so in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n\nSo, yes, the counts are correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place for the first 480 pages.\n   - In the remaining 8 pages (481-488), digits 1-8 each appear once.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in each block of 100 pages. With 4 complete blocks (1-400), each digit appears 40 times.\n   - In the incomplete block (401-488):\n     - 4 appears 10 times (441-450).\n     - 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the different positions where digits can appear: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll need to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each of these positions separately and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's:\n\n1. Units place: The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers (like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484). So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the total number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, it's 48 times. Wait, but actually, the last group might not be complete. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so the last complete group is 480, so yes, 48 times. So, 48 fours in the units place.\n\n2. Tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers (like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449). So, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? From 1 to 488, the hundreds go up to 4, so there are 4 hundreds. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, but 450-459 is also within, but 450-459 is 100 numbers, so the tens digit 4 appears once every 100 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the tens place is 4 (for 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Wait, no, actually, each hundred has one group of 10 where the tens digit is 4, so in 488 pages, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, there's one group where the tens digit is 4, so that's 4 times 10, which is 40 fours in the tens place. Wait, but actually, each group contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so for each hundred, it's 10 fours. So, from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8, so the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours: 40 +10=50. Wait, but 401-488 is only 88 pages, so 440-449 is within that, so yes, another 10 fours. So total tens place fours: 50.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 page numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to fours, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers (8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488). So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, meaning 48 eights in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so the last number is 488, which ends with an 8, so actually, it's 48 +1=49? Wait, let me think: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (1-480), and then 481-488. So, in 1-480, there are 48 eights in the units place, and in 481-488, the units digit 8 appears once at 488. So total units place eights: 48+1=49.\n\n2. Tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers (like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489). But since the book ends at 488, the last group is 480-488. So, how many such groups are there? From 1-488, the hundreds go up to 4, so there are 4 hundreds, each contributing one group where the tens digit is 8. Each group has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds *10=40 eights in the tens place. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 -480 +1=9. Wait, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So total tens place eights: 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 (from the first four hundreds) +9=49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, the total number of fours is 187, and the total number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 187 -98=89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a significant difference, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me recount the fours:\n\nUnits place: From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full times, but since 488 is included, which ends with 8, does that affect the count? Wait, no, because 488 is not a 4 in the units place. So, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, units place fours: 48.\n\nTens place: In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). There are 4 complete hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours: 40+10=50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 48+50+89=187. That seems correct.\n\nNow, eights:\n\nUnits place: From 1-488, every 10 numbers, so 488/10=48.8, so 48 full times, but 488 is included, which ends with 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place eights:49.\n\nTens place: In each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89). There are 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 eights. So, total tens place eights:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: As before, zero.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for eights. From 1-400, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is in the 401-488 range, so that's the fifth occurrence, but wait, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, which is the fifth hundred? No, wait, 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, there's a group where the tens digit is 8, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total tens place eights:40+9=49.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the total number of fours is 187, and eights is 98, so the difference is 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about it, I thought the difference would be higher, but 89 seems reasonable.\n\nWait, let me check another way: maybe using a formula or a different counting method.\n\nAnother approach is to consider each digit position separately and calculate the number of times each digit appears.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor((n + 1)/10) if d is 0, else floor(n/10) + (1 if (n % 10 >= d) else 0). Wait, but actually, for digits 1-9, the formula is a bit different. Let me think.\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is:\n\ncount_units = (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10 >= d) else 0)\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\ncount_tens = (n // 100) * 10 + max(0, (n % 100 - d*10 + 1)) if d != 0 else (n // 100) * 10 + (n % 100)\n\nWait, maybe it's better to use a more straightforward approach.\n\nLet me try to calculate the number of fours and eights in each digit position again.\n\nStarting with fours:\n\nUnits place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place?\n\nThey are 4,14,24,...,484.\n\nThe number of such numbers is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49? Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, now I'm confused.\n\nWait, 484 is the last number with 4 in the units place before 488. So, 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48, but maybe it's 49.\n\nWait, let's list them:\n\n4,14,24,...,484. So, starting at 4, each step +10, up to 484.\n\nThe number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49.\n\nSo, units place fours:49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48 because 488/10=48.8, so 48 full cycles, but 488 is not a 4, so why did I think 48? Maybe I was wrong.\n\nWait, let's check: 1-488, the number of numbers ending with 4 is 49, because 484 is the 49th such number. So, units place fours:49.\n\nSimilarly, for eights, units place:\n\nNumbers ending with 8:8,18,28,...,488.\n\nNumber of terms: (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49.\n\nSo, units place eights:49.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought units place fours were 48, but actually, it's 49. So, I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me correct that.\n\nSo, units place fours:49.\n\nTens place fours:\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers:40-49,140-149,...,440-449.\n\nFrom 1-488, how many such groups are there?\n\n1-100:40-49 (10 numbers)\n101-200:140-149 (10)\n201-300:240-249 (10)\n301-400:340-349 (10)\n401-488:440-449 (10)\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, total groups:5, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50.\n\nWait, but 1-400 has four groups, and 401-488 has one group (440-449). So, total tens place fours:4*10 +10=50.\n\nHundreds place fours:\n\nFrom 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers, as before.\n\nSo, total fours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 187, but now it's 188. Hmm, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nUnits place fours:49\n\nTens place fours:50\n\nHundreds place fours:89\n\nTotal:49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought units place fours were 48, leading to 187, but now I see it's 49, so total fours are 188.\n\nSimilarly, for eights:\n\nUnits place eights:49\n\nTens place eights:49\n\nHundreds place eights:0\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, now I'm getting 90 as the difference, but earlier I thought it was 89. So, I must have made a mistake in the units place count for fours.\n\nLet me double-check the units place fours:\n\nNumbers ending with 4 from 1-488:4,14,24,...,484.\n\nNumber of terms: ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49.\n\nYes, so 49 fours in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for eights, units place:49.\n\nTens place fours:50.\n\nHundreds place fours:89.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nEights:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 89, but now it's 90. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, let me check the hundreds place fours again. From 400-488, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nTens place fours:50.\n\nUnits place fours:49.\n\nSo, 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nEights:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nSo, difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 89. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial count.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is 90, not 89.\n\nWait, let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, I can write a small program or use a formula to calculate the number of times each digit appears.\n\nBut since I'm doing this manually, let me try to recount.\n\nAnother way to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position:\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in units place from 1 to n:\n\ncount_units = (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10 >= d) else 0) if d !=0 else (n // 10)\n\nWait, but for d=0, it's a bit different because 0 doesn't appear in the units place for numbers 1 to n.\n\nBut for d=4:\n\ncount_units = (488 // 10) + (1 if (488 % 10 >=4) else 0) =48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8:\n\ncount_units=(488//10)+(1 if (488%10>=8) else 0)=48 +1=49.\n\nSo, units place:49 fours, 49 eights.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor tens digit d, the count is:\n\ncount_tens = (n // 100) *10 + max(0, (n % 100 - d*10 +1)) if d !=0 else (n // 100)*100.\n\nWait, maybe a better formula is:\n\nFor each digit d in tens place, the count is:\n\ncount_tens = (n // 100) *10 + min(10, n % 100 - d*10 +1) if d !=0 else (n // 100)*100.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think differently.\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred, the digit d appears 10 times in each block of 100, except possibly the last block.\n\nSo, for d=4:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds:4 (since 488 is less than 500). Each complete hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, in the last partial hundred (401-488), how many numbers have 4 in the tens place? It's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 fours.\n\nTotal tens place fours:40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8:\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times, so 4*10=40.\n\nIn the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 9 eights.\n\nTotal tens place eights:40+9=49.\n\nSo, tens place:50 fours,49 eights.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor d=4, it's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nFor d=8, it's from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, hundreds place:89 fours,0 eights.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal eights:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial count by miscalculating the units place fours as 48 instead of 49.\n\nTherefore, the correct difference is 90 fours more than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** The digit '4' appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit '4' appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.

There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit '8' does not appear in any hundreds place within 1-488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 times more than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place, tens place, and hundreds place separately for both digits 4 and 8. I think this approach will help me avoid missing any numbers and ensure I count each occurrence accurately.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484.\n   - Now, how many such groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). But since we're only considering the units place, each group contributes one 4. So, 48 times. But wait, in the last partial group (481-488), does the units digit include a 4? Let me check: 484 is within this range, so that's another 4. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - For every 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449.\n   - How many such hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, the hundreds go from 0 to 4 (since 488 is less than 500). So, in each hundred, there's a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 sets (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 isn't a full hundred. Let me adjust that.\n   - From 0-99: 10 times\n   - From 100-199: 10 times\n   - From 200-299: 10 times\n   - From 300-399: 10 times\n   - From 400-488: Here, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 488 is beyond 449, so 440-449 is fully included. So, that's another 10 times.\n   - So, total tens place 4's: 5 times 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n   - Wait, but let me check: 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, yes. So, 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Because from 400 to 488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct: 89 times.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, for every 10 numbers, there's one 8 in the units place. So, how many full groups of 10 are there in 488? 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Now, the last partial group is 481-488, which includes 488, so that's another 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - For every 100 numbers, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's see:\n   - From 0-99: 10 times (80-89)\n   - From 100-199: 10 times (180-189)\n   - From 200-299: 10 times (280-289)\n   - From 300-399: 10 times (380-389)\n   - From 400-488: Here, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 times.\n   - So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't overcount anywhere. Let me check each digit place again.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49 (correct, as every 10 numbers have one 4 in units, and the last group includes 484)\n- Tens: 50 (each hundred has 10, and we have 5 hundreds, but wait, 400-488 is the fifth hundred, and in that, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (440-449), so yes, 5*10=50)\n- Hundreds: 89 (from 400 to 488, inclusive, which is 89 numbers)\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49 (same logic as 4's)\n- Tens: 49 (four full hundreds contributing 10 each, and the last partial hundred contributing 9)\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
