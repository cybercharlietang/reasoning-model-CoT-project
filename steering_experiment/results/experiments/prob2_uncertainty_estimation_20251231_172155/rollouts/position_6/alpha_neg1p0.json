    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each position and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of ten consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place, and the same goes for the digit 8. Now, I need to figure out how many complete groups of ten there are in the entire range from 1 to 488.\n\nWait, but 488 isn't a multiple of ten, so there will be some incomplete groups. Let me first calculate how many complete groups there are. The total number of page numbers is 488, so the number of complete groups of ten is 488 divided by 10, which is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete groups and then 8 extra numbers (from 481 to 488).\n\nIn each complete group of ten, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for 48 complete groups, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the same for 8's. Now, for the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), I need to check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place. Let's list these numbers: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The units digits here are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, in the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the total number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, the count of 4's and 8's is equal.\n\nNext, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit goes through 0-9 ten times each. Wait, no, actually, in each hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So, for the digit 4, in the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 occurrences, and the same for 8.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many hundreds there are in 488. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then the remaining 88 pages (401-488). So, for each of the 4 complete hundreds, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. So, that's 4 * 10 = 40 for both 4 and 8.\n\nNow, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), I need to check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place. Let's break this down. The numbers from 401 to 488 can be considered as 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). Wait, actually, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, from 400 to 488, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times, but since we're only going up to 488, which is 488 = 400 + 88, so the tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is 4 8 8). Wait, no, let me think again.\n\nWait, 400 to 488: The tens digit starts at 0 (for 400-409), then 1 (410-419), up to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except for 8, which appears 9 times because 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in this partial hundred.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 400-409: tens digit 0, 10 times.\n410-419: tens digit 1, 10 times.\n...\n470-479: tens digit 7, 10 times.\n480-488: tens digit 8, 9 times (since 488 is the last page).\n\nSo, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (from 440-449), and the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (from 480-488). Therefore, in the tens place, the total number of 4's is 4 * 10 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. Wait, no, wait: the complete hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, that's 4 * 10 = 40 for both 4 and 8.\n\nThen, in the remaining 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (from 440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (from 480-488). So, adding that to the previous counts, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50, and the number of 8's in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, that's not correct because in the remaining 88 pages, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, adding to the 40 from the complete hundreds, we get 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused here. Let me double-check. The complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 4 * 10 = 40 for both 4 and 8 in the tens place. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times, so adding 10 to 40 gives 50 for 4's. For 8's, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 times, so adding 9 to 40 gives 49 for 8's. So yes, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (400-488). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times, and 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the highest page number is 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400-488, and for pages 1-399, the hundreds digit is 0, 1, 2, 3, etc., but 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89, and the number of 8's is 0.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's in the hundreds place. Pages 100-399: hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, so again, no 4's or 8's. Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so 4 appears 89 times (from 400 to 488 inclusive), and 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, yes, 4's in hundreds place: 89, 8's: 0.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit position.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because when I add 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) for 4's, that's 188. For 8's, 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But I feel like I might have made a mistake somewhere because that seems like a big difference. Let me check each step again.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- Each group of 10 pages contributes 1 four and 1 eight.\n- There are 48 complete groups (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n- In the units place, 48 fours and 48 eights from the complete groups.\n- In the extra 8 pages, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n- So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 fours, 48 + 1 = 49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each complete hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n- There are 4 complete hundreds (1-400), so 4 * 10 = 40 fours and 40 eights.\n- In the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449 (10 times).\n- The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488 (9 times because 488 is the last page).\n- So, total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 fours, 40 + 9 = 49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n- So, 89 fours in the hundreds place, and 0 eights. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n- Fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n- Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I thought the difference might be smaller. Let me check another way. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position again to confirm.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit position, calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n- Total numbers: 488.\n- For each position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a digit appears can be calculated as follows.\n- For units place: Each digit 0-9 appears equally often, except possibly the last partial group.\n- The number of complete groups of 10 is 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8), so 48 complete groups, each contributing 1 four and 1 eight.\n- The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once.\n- So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 fours, 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\nTens place:\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred.\n- There are 4 complete hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40 for each.\n- The remaining 88 numbers (401-488) have tens digits from 0 to 8.\n- The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 440-449, which is 10 times.\n- The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 480-488, which is 9 times.\n- So, tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 fours, 40 + 9 = 49 eights.\n\nHundreds place:\n- Only from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n- No eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up:\n- Fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n- Eights: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n- Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, I think I did it correctly both times. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I didn't double-count or miss any numbers. For example, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, yes, 10 and 9.\n\nUnits place: 48 fours and 48 eights from the complete groups, plus 1 each from the remaining 8 numbers, totaling 49 each.\n\nSo, yes, the total number of 4's is 188 and 8's is 98, so 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 90 seems like a lot. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using a formula or a more systematic method.\n\nAnother method: For each digit position, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n- The number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to n is given by:\n  - Complete groups: n // 10\n  - Remaining: max(0, (n % 10) - d + 1) if d <= (n % 10) else 0\n- So, for 4 in units place:\n  - Complete groups: 488 // 10 = 48\n  - Remaining: if 4 <= 8 (since 488 % 10 = 8), then 8 - 4 + 1 = 5\n  - Wait, no, that formula might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, the formula is: for each digit d, the count in the units place is (n // 10) * 1 + (1 if d <= (n % 10) else 0). So, for 4:\n- 488 // 10 = 48\n- 4 <= 8, so add 1\n- Total: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nSimilarly for 8:\n- 488 // 10 = 48\n- 8 <= 8, so add 1\n- Total: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nSo, units place: 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\nTens place:\n- The count for digit d in the tens place up to n is calculated as:\n  - Hundreds = n // 100\n  - Remainder = n % 100\n  - If d < 10:\n    - Count = hundreds * 10\n    - If d <= (Remainder // 10), add 1\n    - If d == (Remainder // 10), add (Remainder % 10 + 1)\n  - So, for 4 in tens place:\n    - Hundreds = 488 // 100 = 4\n    - Remainder = 488 % 100 = 88\n    - 4 < 10\n    - Count = 4 * 10 = 40\n    - Since 4 <= 8 (Remainder // 10 = 8), add 1\n    - So, total: 40 + 1 = 41? Wait, that doesn't match my earlier count.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula. Let me look it up.\n\nWait, the correct formula for counting digit occurrences in the tens place is:\n\nFor each position, the count is calculated as follows:\n\n- Let\u2019s consider the tens place. The number of times a digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to n can be calculated by:\n  1. Divide n by 100 to get the number of complete hundreds, say high.\n  2. The remainder when n is divided by 100 is low.\n  3. The count is high * 10.\n  4. If the tens digit of n (i.e., low // 10) is greater than d, add 10.\n  5. If the tens digit is equal to d, add (low % 10 + 1).\n  6. If the tens digit is less than d, add 0.\n\nWait, so applying this to d=4 in the tens place for n=488:\n\nhigh = 488 // 100 = 4\nlow = 488 % 100 = 88\ntens_digit = low // 10 = 8\nones_digit = low % 10 = 8\n\nSo, count = high * 10 = 4 * 10 = 40\nSince tens_digit (8) > d (4), we add 10? Wait, no, if tens_digit > d, we add 10. If tens_digit == d, add (ones_digit + 1). If tens_digit < d, add 0.\n\nWait, so in this case, tens_digit is 8, which is greater than d=4, so we add 10.\n\nSo, total count = 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8 in the tens place:\n\nhigh = 4\nlow = 88\ntens_digit = 8\nones_digit = 8\n\ncount = 4 * 10 = 40\nSince tens_digit == d=8, we add (ones_digit + 1) = 8 + 1 = 9\nTotal count = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, that matches my earlier calculation: 50 fours and 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds place, the count for d=4 is:\n\nhigh = 488 // 1000 = 0\nlow = 488 % 1000 = 488\nhundreds_digit = low // 100 = 4\nif hundreds_digit > d=4: add 100\nif hundreds_digit == d=4: add (low % 100 + 1)\nif hundreds_digit < d=4: add 0\n\nWait, actually, the formula for hundreds place is similar. Let me think.\n\nWait, for hundreds place, the count for d=4 is:\n\nhigh = 488 // 1000 = 0\nlow = 488 % 1000 = 488\nhundreds_digit = 4 (since 400-488)\n\nSo, count = high * 100 + (if hundreds_digit > d: 100, elif hundreds_digit == d: (low % 100) + 1, else 0)\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to think that for the hundreds place, each hundred contributes 100 numbers where the hundreds digit is fixed. So, for d=4, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, count is 89.\n\nFor d=8, the hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, but since our n is 488, there are no such numbers. So, count is 0.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4). From 11-20, it appears once (page 14), and so on. So, how many sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, we take the whole number part, which is 48. So, that gives us 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so in the last set (481-490), only up to 488 is printed. So, page 489-490 don't exist. However, in the units place, 488 ends with 8, so the last occurrence of 4 in the units place would be at 484. So, actually, from 1-480, there are 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Then, from 481-488, we have 8 more numbers, but the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this last partial set, the digit 4 appears once (page 484). Therefore, total 4's in the units place would be 48 (from the first 480 pages) plus 1 (from 481-488), totaling 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1-480, that's 480 pages, which is 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 occurrences. Then, from 481-488, which is 8 pages, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (at 484). So, total 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nNext, the tens place. For the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 10 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, from 140-149, and so on. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nEach block is 100 pages, but actually, each block is 10 numbers in the tens place, but across different hundreds. Wait, perhaps a better way is to consider each hundred. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9, so in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). So, from 1-100, 40-49 gives 10 4's in the tens place. Similarly, from 101-200, 140-149 gives another 10, and so on.\n\nSo, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, we have 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40.\n\nNow, the last partial hundred is 401-488. Let's check how many times 4 appears in the tens place here. The tens digit in 401-488 can be 0 (401-409), 1 (410-419), 2 (420-429), 3 (430-439), 4 (440-449), 5 (450-459), 6 (460-469), 7 (470-479), 8 (480-488). Wait, so in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 occurrences. Therefore, in the partial hundred, we have another 10 4's in the tens place. So, total 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is only 88 pages, so 440-449 is 10 pages, which is within 401-488, so yes, that's correct. So, total 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Therefore, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Page 400 is the first page with 4 in the hundreds place, and it goes up to 488. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's compute that. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, for every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, total 8's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 1-480, that's 480 pages, which is 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, total 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nEach hundred has one such block. From 1-100, 80-89 gives 10 8's in the tens place. Similarly, 101-200, 180-189 gives another 10, and so on.\n\nSo, how many hundreds are there in 488? As before, 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times. So, 4 hundreds contribute 4*10=40.\n\nNow, the last partial hundred is 401-488. Let's see how many times 8 appears in the tens place here. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 in each hundred. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, but only 9 numbers. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in 480-488.\n\nWait, but 480 is part of 401-488, right? So, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, and there are 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Therefore, in the partial hundred, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place would be 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 49 + 49 is 98, yes. But let me double-check. For the tens place, in 401-488, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 188 - 98 = 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's and 8's.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. I had 50 4's in the tens place. Let me recount that.\n\nEach hundred has 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: 4 hundreds give 4*10=40, and in 401-488, 480-488 gives 9 numbers, so 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: for the tens place, the number of times a digit d appears is calculated by (number of complete hundreds) * 10 + (if the current hundred has a higher number, then add the count in the current hundred). So, for 4's in tens place, since 488 is less than 500, the current hundred (401-488) has 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. So, 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place, the current hundred (401-488) has 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the hundreds place for 4's, I considered 400-488 as 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, the calculation seems accurate.\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** \n     - Every 10 numbers contribute 1 '4'.\n     - Total sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full sets (1-480) + 1 in 481-488.\n     - Total '4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** \n     - Each hundred has 10 '4's in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).\n     - 4 complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 '4's.\n     - In 401-488, 440-449 adds 10 '4's.\n     - Total '4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** \n     - Pages 400-488 have '4' in the hundreds place: 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** \n     - Every 10 numbers contribute 1 '8'.\n     - Total sets of 10: 48 full sets (1-480) + 1 in 481-488.\n     - Total '8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** \n     - Each hundred has 10 '8's in the tens place (e.g., 80-89).\n     - 4 complete hundreds contribute 40 '8's.\n     - In 401-488, 480-488 adds 9 '8's.\n     - Total '8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** \n     - No pages have '8' in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's - Number of '8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each position, I'll calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, every 10 numbers, the digit cycles through 0-9. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete blocks of 10 in the total range, plus any extra numbers beyond the last complete block.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of 4's in the units place. The total number of page numbers is 488. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48 complete blocks, with 8 remaining numbers (481-488). In each complete block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, does 4 appear in the units place here? Yes, at 484. So, that's one more. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place. Again, 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so so far, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the difference in the units place is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each block of 100. So, for example, in 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (40-49), and similarly for 8.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488. That's 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then a partial block from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. So, for 4 complete blocks, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for 4, and 40 times for 8.\n\nNow, the partial block is from 401-488. Let's look at the tens place in this range. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in this block. So, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on, up to 8 for 481-490. But wait, our range ends at 488, so the last set is 481-488, which is only 8 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them.\n\nSo, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, in the partial block, the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 440-449. But wait, our range starts at 401, so 440-449 is within 401-488. So, that's 10 numbers, so 10 times. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in the partial block. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, but since our range ends at 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, actually, 480 is included, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so 9 times? Wait, no, because 480 is 4-8-0, so the tens digit is 8. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: 480 is included, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, in the partial block, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in the tens place: 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the partial block, so 50.\n\nTotal 8's in the tens place: 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 9 in the partial block, so 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 49 times, so the difference here is +1 for 4's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. So, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nEach hundreds digit block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) has 100, 100, 100, and 89 numbers respectively.\n\nWait, no, actually, 400-488 is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in each complete hundreds block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3 respectively, each appearing 100 times. But in the last block, 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times.\n\nNow, we need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n\nFirst, for 4 in the hundreds place: only in the block 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nFor 8 in the hundreds place: looking at the blocks, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place in any of these blocks because none of the hundreds digits are 8. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's in the hundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, the difference here is +89 for 4's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit position.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 488 pages, so 488 / 10 = 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, 49 each, correct.\n\nTens place: 488 / 100 = 4 full blocks, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 each. Then, the partial block 401-488: for 4's in tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so +10. For 8's in tens place, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so +9. So, 4's: 40+10=50, 8's:40+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4's appear 89 times (400-488), 8's appear 0 times. Correct.\n\nAdding up: 4's:49+50+89=188, 8's:49+49+0=98. Difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check: from 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but does 400 count as the first page? Yes, because the book starts at 1, so 400 is included. So, 89 is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 never appears, so that's correct.\n\nSo, the total counts are correct, and the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. For the partial block 401-488, when considering the tens digit, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct, and the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total blocks of 10: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 blocks, with 8 remaining numbers (481-488).\n   - 4's: 48 (from blocks) + 1 (484) = 49.\n   - 8's: 48 (from blocks) + 1 (488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - Total blocks of 100: 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and a partial block (401-488).\n   - 4's: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 10 in 440-449 = 50.\n   - 8's: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 in 480-488 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4's: Appear in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - 8's: Do not appear in any hundreds place in 1-488.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, for the units place:\n\n- The digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears once (like 8, 18, 28, etc.).\n\n- Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 more numbers (481 to 488). \n\n- So, in the units place, the number of 4's is 48 (from each complete set) plus 1 if the last partial set includes a 4. Wait, the last partial set is 481-488, which includes 484, so that's one more 4. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Similarly, for 8's in units place: 48 complete sets give 48 eights, and the last partial set (481-488) includes 488, which is an 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 eights in units place.\n\nWait, so in units place, both 4's and 8's appear 49 times each. So, the difference here is zero. Hmm, interesting.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place:\n\n- The digit in the tens place cycles every 100 numbers. For each hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, in 0-99, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 times, and similarly for 8 in 80-89.\n\n- So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8.\n\n- Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\n- So, for each of the 4 complete hundreds, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\n- Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred, so 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\n- Now, for the partial hundred (401-488), we need to check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\n- In 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), but wait, 480 is page 480, and 488 is page 488, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but actually, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it's from 440-449, which is 10 pages. For 8, it's from 480-488, which is 9 pages because 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 pages (including both 480 and 488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the partial hundred.\n\nSo, total for tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from partial) = 50\n- 8's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from partial) = 49\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 49. So, the difference here is 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place:\n\n- The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\n- So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n\n- The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if there were pages 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8's in the hundreds place are 0.\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nSo, difference here is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each place:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- Each 10 numbers contribute 1 to each digit. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1, and then the partial set 481-488 has 484 and 488, so 2 more? Wait, no, 481-488 is 8 numbers: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, in the units place, 484 is a 4, and 488 is an 8. So, in the units place, the last partial set adds 1 to 4's and 1 to 8's, making units place counts 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For complete hundreds (1-400), each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digits are 0-8. So, 440-449 is 10 times for 4, and 480-488 is 9 times for 8. So, 10 + 40 = 50 for 4's, and 9 + 40 = 49 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. No 8's, correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but when I first thought, I thought maybe the difference would be smaller, but 90 seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 pages, correct. So, 89 4's there.\n\nIn the tens place, 4's: 50, 8's: 49.\n\nUnits place: both 49.\n\nSo, 89 + 50 + 49 = 188 for 4's.\n\nAnd 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 for 8's.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, in each block, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears in 4, and 8 appears in 8. Similarly, from 11-20, 4 appears in 14, and 8 appears in 18, and so on.\n\nNow, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then a partial block of 8 pages (since 488 = 48*10 + 8). So, in each full block, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. Therefore, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48.\n\nWait, but there's an extra 8 pages beyond the 480th page. So, the last partial block is pages 481-488. In the units place, the digits here are 1 through 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (in 484), and 8 appears once (in 488). So, adding these, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the total number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89).\n\nNow, how many full blocks of 100 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401-488.\n\nIn each full block, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4 blocks would give 4*10 = 40 times for 4. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times per block, so 4*10 = 40 times for 8.\n\nNow, the partial block is from 401-488. Let's look at the tens place here. The numbers go from 401 to 488, so the tens digit cycles through 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the tens digit in 481-488 is 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in this partial block? Let's see: the tens digit is 4 in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 441-450 is within 401-488, so that's 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place in 481-488, which is 8 numbers (481-488), so the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers. Wait, but 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for each of those, so that's 8 times.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 481-488 is 8 numbers, each with tens digit 8, so that's 8 times. So, in the partial block, the number of 4's in the tens place is 10, and the number of 8's is 8.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 (from full blocks) + 10 (from partial block) = 50. The total number of 8's in the tens place is 40 (from full blocks) + 8 (from partial block) = 48.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. And 8 in the tens place is from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present in three-digit numbers, which start from 100. So, in the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 4 appears, since 488 is the last page. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. The number of pages here is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, the count for 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nNow, let me summarize the counts:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let me add these up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nWait, but let me check the units and tens counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 488 pages. For every 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing 1 to 4's and 1 to 8's. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have 484, which is 4, and 488, which is 8. So, units place: 48 +1=49 for 4's, and 48 +1=49 for 8's. That's correct.\n\nTens place: Each block of 100 has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place. So, 4 blocks give 40 each. The partial block from 401-488: 441-450 gives 10 for 4's, and 481-488 gives 8 for 8's. So, 40 +10=50 for 4's, and 40 +8=48 for 8's. That seems right.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 times for 4's. 8's never appear in hundreds place, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 +50 +89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +48 +0 =97.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units place for 8's. Let me recount.\n\nIn the units place, each block of 10 pages has exactly one 8. So, 488 pages would have 48 full blocks (each contributing 1 eight), and then the last partial block from 481-488, which includes 488, so that's another 1 eight. So, 48 +1=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the units place, same thing: 48 full blocks, each contributing 1 four, and then 484 in the last partial block, so 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's: each block of 100 contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4 blocks give 40, and the partial block from 401-488 includes 441-450, which is 10 fours. So, 40+10=50. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place: each block of 100 contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 blocks give 40. The partial block from 401-488 includes 481-488, which is 8 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, 8 eights. So, 40+8=48. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 fours. Correct. No eights.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0=97.\n\nDifference: 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, but I thought the answer might be 91, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the partial blocks.\n\nWait, in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digits are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, for each tens digit, how many times does it occur?\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 numbers.\n\n411-420: tens digit 1, 10 numbers.\n\n421-430: tens digit 2, 10 numbers.\n\n431-440: tens digit 3, 10 numbers.\n\n441-450: tens digit 4, 10 numbers.\n\n451-460: tens digit 5, 10 numbers.\n\n461-470: tens digit 6, 10 numbers.\n\n471-480: tens digit 7, 10 numbers.\n\n481-488: tens digit 8, 8 numbers.\n\nSo, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (441-450), and tens digit 8 occurs 8 times (481-488). So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, the last partial block is 481-488, which includes 484 (units digit 4) and 488 (units digit 8). So, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. So, 188 -97=91. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all the cases correctly. Sometimes, when dealing with digit counts, it's easy to miscount the partial blocks.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position separately, using a formula.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is equal to:\n\nfull_cycles = N // 10\n\nremainder = N % 10\n\ncount = full_cycles * 1\n\nif d <= remainder:\n    count +=1\n\nSo, for 4's in units place:\n\nN=488, d=4.\n\nfull_cycles=488//10=48\n\nremainder=488%10=8\n\nSince 4 <=8, count=48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly for 8's:\n\nfull_cycles=48, remainder=8.\n\nSince 8<=8, count=48+1=49.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to N is calculated as:\n\nfull_cycles = N // 100\n\nremainder = (N % 100)\n\ncount = full_cycles * 10\n\nif remainder >=10*d:\n    count +=10 - (remainder - 10*d +1)\nelif remainder >= d*10:\n    count += (remainder - d*10 +1)\nelse:\n    count +=0\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many full hundreds and then the remainder.\n\nAlternatively, for the tens place, each digit appears 10 times per hundred. So, for N=488, the number of hundreds is 4 (since 4*100=400). So, 4*10=40 times for each digit in the tens place.\n\nThen, the remainder is 88 (488-400=88). So, in the tens place, the digit can appear in the next partial hundred.\n\nFor digit 4 in the tens place:\n\nIn the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 488 is less than 449? No, 488 is greater than 449. Wait, 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in the partial block.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in the tens place, it occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480 is included? Wait, 480 is part of the 401-488 range. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. Wait, but 480 is 4-8-0, so tens digit is 8. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 pages? Wait, 488-480+1=9 pages. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers, but wait, 480 is the first, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. But earlier, I thought it was 8 numbers because I was counting 481-488 as 8 numbers, but that's incorrect. 480 is included, so it's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought the partial block was 401-488, which is 88 numbers. So, the tens digit cycles through 0 (401-410),1 (411-420),...,8 (481-490). But since the book ends at 488, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers, not 9. Wait, 481-488 is 8 numbers: 481,482,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers, not 9. So, perhaps my initial count was correct with 8.\n\nWait, but 480 is included in the partial block? Wait, 401-488 includes 480? No, 401-488 is from 401 up to 488. So, 480 is within that range. So, 480 is page 480, which is in 401-488. So, the tens digit for 480 is 8, right? Because 480 is 4-8-0.\n\nWait, but in the partial block, we're looking at the tens digits from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. But wait, 480 is the first number with tens digit 8 in that partial block, and 488 is the last. So, that's 9 numbers, meaning 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought it was 8 numbers because I was starting from 481. So, I think I made a mistake there. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, in the tens place, for the partial block 401-488, the digit 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 occurrences, not 8. So, the count for 8's in the tens place should be 40 (from full blocks) +9=49.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier count. Let me see.\n\nWait, no, the partial block is 401-488, which includes 480. So, 480 is part of this range, so the tens digit 8 starts at 480, which is included. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo, that means in the tens place, the number of 8's is 40 (from full blocks) +9=49.\n\nSimilarly, the number of 4's in the tens place is 40 (from full blocks) +10 (from 440-449)=50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8 numbers, but now I'm seeing it's 9. So, that changes the count.\n\nSo, let's correct that.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\n4's: 40 (from full blocks) +10 (from 440-449)=50.\n\n8's:40 (from full blocks) +9 (from 480-488)=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 480-488 was 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, that would make total 8's in tens place 49.\n\nWait, but then let's check units place again. In the units place, we had 49 fours and 49 eights.\n\nSo, total 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 4's=49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 8's=49+49=98.\n\nWait, so that's different from before. So, the difference would be 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, so now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 91, but now it's 90. Which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the partial block's tens digit count. Let me verify:\n\nFrom 401-488, how many times does the digit 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nThe tens digit is 8 for numbers from 480-488. So, 480 is included, as 480 <=488.\n\nSo, 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488: that's 9 numbers.\n\nSo, 9 times the digit 8 appears in the tens place in the partial block.\n\nSimilarly, the digit 4 appears in the tens place from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, all within 401-488.\n\nSo, for 8's in the tens place: 40 (from full blocks) +9=49.\n\nFor 4's in the tens place:40 +10=50.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so that's different from my initial calculation. So, I must have made a mistake earlier by miscounting the number of 8's in the tens place in the partial block.\n\nSo, the correct count is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check:\n\nUnits place:\n\n4's:49\n\n8's:49\n\nTens place:\n\n4's:50\n\n8's:49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's:89\n\n8's:0\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct now.\n\nSo, where did I go wrong earlier? I think I miscounted the number of 8's in the tens place in the partial block. I thought it was 8, but it's actually 9 because 480 is included in the partial block, making it 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n\nTherefore, the correct difference is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total blocks of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full blocks, contributing 1 occurrence each of 4 and 8.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488) include 484 (4) and 488 (8).\n   - **4's:** 48 + 1 = 49\n   - **8's:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Full hundreds: 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 occurrences.\n   - Remaining pages (401-488):\n     - 4's: 440-449 (10 occurrences)\n     - 8's: 480-488 (9 occurrences)\n   - **4's:** 4*10 + 10 = 50\n   - **8's:** 4*10 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 400-488: 89 occurrences of 4.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - **4's:** 89\n   - **8's:** 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nFirst, the units place. In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4). From 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and then an extra 8 pages. Each complete set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is within this range, adding one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me think again. Actually, each set of ten contributes one 4 in the units place, so from 1 to 480, that's 48 sets, so 48 fours. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which adds one more 4. So yes, 48 + 1 = 49 fours in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. Similarly, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in every set of 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49 for each hundred. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 times. Then, in 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10 times. This pattern continues up to 400-488. Let me calculate how many hundreds we have. From 1-400, that's four hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit can be 0-8, but since 401-488 is part of the 400s, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8. The fours in the tens place here would be from 440-449, which is 10 fours. So, adding that, total fours in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but wait, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So yes, that's correct. So, 40 + 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is the sum of fours in units, tens, and hundreds places. That would be 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, looking at units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in every set of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many complete sets of ten are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is included, which adds one more 8. So, total 8's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, 488 is the last page, so from 481 to 488, that's 8 pages: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, the units digits are 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So yes, that's correct, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in every set of 100 numbers, specifically in the range 80-89 for each hundred. So, in 1-100, 80-89 is 10 numbers, contributing 10 eights in the tens place. Similarly, in 101-200, it's 180-189, another 10 eights. This pattern continues up to 400-488. Let's see how many hundreds we have. From 1-400, that's four hundreds, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40 eights.\n\nNow, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in the range 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here. Therefore, total eights in the tens place would be 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me make sure. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, yes, 9 eights in the tens place for this range. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, there are zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is the sum of eights in units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, 49 + 49 is 98, yes. So, 98 eights in total.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, for the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 sets of ten (1-480) with one 4 each, so 48. Then, from 481-488, 484 is included, adding one more, so 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49 in each hundred, so four hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40. Then, 440-449 in 401-488, which is 10, so 40+10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 sets of ten (1-480) with one 8 each, so 48. Then, 488 is included, adding one more, so 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89 in each hundred, so four hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40. Then, 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. Total 40+9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, as the book doesn't go beyond 488. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. And for 8's, the tens digit in 480-488 is 8, but since 488 is the last page, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. That seems right.\n\nI think I've covered all cases. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - In every set of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 480 pages, contributing 48 fours.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) include 484, adding one more 4.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49 fours.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - In every set of 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).\n   - There are four sets of 100 (1-400), contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 fours.\n   - From 401-488, 440-449 adds another 10 fours.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50 fours.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89 fours.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - 48 complete sets contribute 48 eights.\n   - The remaining 8 pages include 488, adding one more 8.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - In every set of 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89).\n   - Four sets of 100 contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights.\n   - From 401-488, 480-488 adds 9 eights (since 488 is the last page).\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers reach 800, so no eights here.\n   - Total: 0 eights.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, for the units place. For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (at 4), and 8 appears once (at 8). Similarly, from 11-20, 4 appears once (at 14), and 8 appears once (at 18), and so on.\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, the number of complete groups of 10 is 48 (because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups). In each group, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 times, and the same for 8. But wait, the last group is 481-490, but since the book ends at 488, the units digits go up to 8. So, actually, in the units place, 4 and 8 each appear 48 times, but we have to check if the last group affects this. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so the units digits go from 0 to 8 in the last group. So, the digit 8 appears once more in the units place in the last partial group (488), making it 48 + 1 = 49 times? Wait, no, because the last group is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8 in the 480s. So, in the units place, for the 480s, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, actually, the number of times 4 and 8 appear in the units place is the same, which is 48 times for each. Wait, no, because from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Let me think again.\n\nEach group of 10 has one 4 and one 8 in the units place. The total number of groups is 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8). So, 48 groups mean 48 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place. But wait, the last group is 481-490, but we only go up to 488, so in the units place for the last group, 481-488, the digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, that's 48 times each in the units place because the last group only adds one more 4 and one more 8, but since the total number of groups is 48, it's 48 times each. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so the units digits go up to 8, so in the units place, 4 appears 48 times, and 8 appears 48 times as well because each group contributes one each, and the last group contributes one each as well. So, units place: 4 appears 48 times, 8 appears 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0-9 ten times each (for 00-09, 10-19, ..., 90-99). Wait, no, actually, in the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, for 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each, but actually, from 1-99, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, up to 9 for 90-99. So, in 1-99, each tens digit from 0-9 appears 10 times (except 0, which appears 9 times because 1-9 have 0 in the tens place). Wait, no, let me correct that. From 1-99, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9 (9 numbers), and then 1 for 10-19 (10 numbers), up to 9 for 90-99 (10 numbers). So, in total, 0 appears 9 times in the tens place, and digits 1-9 each appear 10 times in the tens place from 1-99.\n\nBut in our case, we're going up to 488, so we have 1-488. Let's break this down into hundreds. The first 100 pages (1-100), the next 100 (101-200), then 201-300, 301-400, and finally 401-488.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to consider each hundred separately. Let's think about how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nFirst, from 1-99:\n\n- Tens digit 4: appears in 40-49, which is 10 times.\n- Tens digit 8: appears in 80-89, which is 10 times.\n\nSo, in 1-99, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNext, from 100-199:\n\n- Tens digit 4: appears in 140-149, which is 10 times.\n- Tens digit 8: appears in 180-189, which is 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, in 200-299:\n\n- Tens digit 4: 240-249, 10 times.\n- Tens digit 8: 280-289, 10 times.\n\nIn 300-399:\n\n- Tens digit 4: 340-349, 10 times.\n- Tens digit 8: 380-389, 10 times.\n\nNow, in 400-488:\n\n- Tens digit 4: 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 times.\n- Tens digit 8: 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in 400-488.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449 (10 times) and 8 for 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in 400-488, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, summing up:\n\n- 4 in tens place: 10 (1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-449) = 50 times.\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, from 1-99, 4 in tens place: 10 times.\nFrom 100-199: 10 times.\nFrom 200-299: 10 times.\nFrom 300-399: 10 times.\nFrom 400-488: 10 times (440-449) and 9 times (480-488) for 8's.\n\nWait, no, I'm mixing up. Let me separate 4's and 8's.\n\nFor 4's in the tens place:\n\n- 1-99: 10 times (40-49)\n- 100-199: 10 times (140-149)\n- 200-299: 10 times (240-249)\n- 300-399: 10 times (340-349)\n- 400-488: 10 times (440-449)\nTotal: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50 times.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place:\n\n- 1-99: 10 times (80-89)\n- 100-199: 10 times (180-189)\n- 200-299: 10 times (280-289)\n- 300-399: 10 times (380-389)\n- 400-488: 9 times (480-488)\nTotal: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards, up to 488. So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no contribution.\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's here.\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's or 8's.\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's or 8's.\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these 89 pages. Therefore, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times.\n- 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n- Units place: 48 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 times.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 48 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's = 48 + 49 + 0 = 97 times.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n- Each group of 10 has one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 pages mean 48 full groups (since 48*10=480), and then 8 more pages (481-488).\n- In each group, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place, so 48 times each.\n- In the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n- So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8. Wait, wait, earlier I thought it was 48 each, but now I'm getting 49 each. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The total number of page numbers is 488. The number of complete groups of 10 is 48 (since 48*10=480), and then 8 remaining pages (481-488). Each complete group contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). Therefore, total units place for 4: 48 + 1 = 49, and for 8: 48 + 1 = 49. So, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by saying 48 each; it's actually 49 each.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place was 48 each, but now I'm getting 49 each. Let me confirm.\n\nTotal page numbers: 488.\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(488 / 10) = 48 groups (each contributing one 4 and one 8 in units place).\n\nRemaining pages: 488 - (48*10) = 8 pages (481-488).\n\nIn these 8 pages, units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\nTherefore, total units place:\n- 4: 48 + 1 = 49\n- 8: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nSo, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place.\n\nEarlier, I thought it was 48 each, but that was incorrect. So, I need to correct that.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nAs before, for the tens place:\n\n- From 1-99: 10 times each for 4 and 8.\n- From 100-199: 10 times each.\n- From 200-299: 10 times each.\n- From 300-399: 10 times each.\n- From 400-488: 10 times for 4 (440-449) and 9 times for 8 (480-488).\n\nSo, total tens place:\n- 4: 10*4 (from 1-399) + 10 (440-449) = 50 times.\n- 8: 10*4 (from 1-399) + 9 (480-488) = 49 times.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\n- 400-488: 89 pages, so 89 times for 4.\n- 8 in hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, total counts:\n\n- 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n- 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, so 4's: 188, 8's: 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place was 48 each, leading to 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187, 8's: 48 + 49 + 0 = 97, difference 90. Now, with units place corrected to 49 each, 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188, 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98, difference 90. So, same difference.\n\nWait, so whether I count units place as 48 each or 49 each, the difference remains 90 because both are increased by 1, so the difference stays the same.\n\nBut let me confirm the units place again to be sure.\n\nTotal page numbers: 488.\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: 48 (since 48*10=480), so 48 groups, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n\nRemaining pages: 8 (481-488).\n\nIn these 8 pages, units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\nTherefore, total units place:\n\n- 4: 48 + 1 = 49\n- 8: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nSo, correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place:\n\n- From 1-99: 10 each\n- 100-199: 10 each\n- 200-299: 10 each\n- 300-399: 10 each\n- 400-488: 10 for 4, 9 for 8.\n\nSo, 4's: 10*4 + 10 = 50\n8's: 10*4 + 9 = 49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4: 89\n- 8: 0\n\nSo, totals:\n\n4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each position and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor the units digit, the pattern repeats every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, there are 48 complete blocks and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). In each complete block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial block, the digit 4 appears once (484). Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, each complete block has one 8 (like 8, 18, 28, etc.), so that's also 48 times. In the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, the total number of 8's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so both 4's and 8's in the units place are 49 each. So, the difference here is zero. Hmm, interesting.\n\nMoving on to the tens place:\n\nNow, for the tens digit, the pattern repeats every 100 numbers. In each hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 ten times (40-49), and similarly for 8 (80-89). So, for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 also appears 10 times.\n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an extra 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each of these 4 complete hundreds, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, so 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, in the extra 88 pages (401-488), we need to check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place. Let's break this down:\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (in 401-410) to 8 (in 481-488). Wait, no, actually, 401-410 would have tens digit 0, 411-420 would have 1, and so on up to 480-488, where the tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, in the 400s, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? It would be from 440-449, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the 400s.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 401-488, the tens digit is 0 in 401-410, 1 in 411-420, ..., up to 8 in 480-488. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, there are 10 numbers except for the last one, which is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page.\n\nWait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the digit 8 in the tens place appears 9 times here.\n\nSimilarly, the digit 4 in the tens place appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in the 400s, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 4 (from the complete hundreds) * 10 = 40 plus 10 from the 400s, totaling 50.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, etc.) each contribute 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 400s, we have an additional 10 4's in the tens place (440-449), so total 4's in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, each of the 4 complete hundreds contributes 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 400s, we have 9 8's in the tens place (480-488), so total 8's in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 49 times. So, the difference here is 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I did that correctly. Let me check again. In the 400s, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for each digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear in the tens place?\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 times.\n411-420: tens digit 1, 10 times.\n...\n471-480: tens digit 7, 10 times.\n481-490: tens digit 8, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 times (481-488). Wait, that's 8 numbers, right? 481, 482, ..., 488. So, 8 numbers, so the digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place in the 400s.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier thought. So, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears exactly 10 times because each block like 401-410 is 10 numbers. But for the tens digit 8, it's from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. Wait, 480 is part of the 480-489 block, but 480 is included in 480-488, so that's 9 numbers.\n\nWait, but 480 is actually part of the 480-489 block, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 in the 400s appears 9 times (480-488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the 400s.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8 times, but now I'm getting 9 times. Let me count:\n\n480: tens digit 8\n481: tens digit 8\n...\n488: tens digit 8\nSo, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, in the 400s, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, 4 appears in the tens place from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nSo, in the 400s, 4's in the tens place: 10\n8's in the tens place: 9\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place: 4 complete hundreds * 10 = 40 + 10 = 50\nTotal 8's in the tens place: 4 complete hundreds * 10 = 40 + 9 = 49\n\nSo, the difference is 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 10 in the 400s for 4's and 9 for 8's. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place:\n\nIn the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 4 appears in the hundreds place for certain ranges. Let's see:\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (since they are two-digit or single-digit numbers), so no 4's or 8's here in the hundreds place.\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's here.\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's or 8's here.\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's or 8's here.\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so 4 appears here.\n- Pages 500-...: Not applicable since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in all page numbers from 400 to 488. How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place?\n\nFrom 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears zero times in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89, and 8's is 0.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49 \u2192 difference 0\n- Tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49 \u2192 difference +1\n- Hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0 \u2192 difference +89\n\nAdding up the differences: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nTotal pages: 488\n\nFor units digit 4:\n\nEach 10 pages contribute 1 four in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48 full tens, contributing 48 fours. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit is 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total 48 + 1 = 49 fours.\n\nSame for units digit 8: 48 full tens contribute 48 eights, and in the remaining 8 pages, 8 appears once (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 fours and 10 eights, so 4*10=40 fours and 4*10=40 eights.\n\nNow, the remaining pages are 401-488, which is 88 pages.\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times do they appear?\n\nEach tens digit from 0 to 7 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place because each block is 10 pages. For example, 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 times; 411-420: tens digit 1, 10 times; ..., 471-480: tens digit 7, 10 times.\n\nThen, for tens digit 8, it's 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 pages: 480-488. So, tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, in the 400s:\n\nFours in tens place: when tens digit is 4, which is 440-449, 10 times.\n\nEights in tens place: when tens digit is 8, which is 9 times (480-488).\n\nTherefore, total fours in tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal eights in tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, difference in tens place: 50 - 49 = +1.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nAs established, 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nBut let me double-check the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. Each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. That's correct.\n\nAnd since the book doesn't go beyond 488, there's no page with an 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles through 0-9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4), and 8 appears once (page 8). Similarly, from 11-20, 4 appears once (page 14), and 8 appears once (page 18). This pattern continues up to page 488.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488 pages. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and an additional 8 pages (481-488). \n\nIn each complete group of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 complete groups, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the same for 8's. Now, I need to check the remaining 8 pages (481-488). The units digits here are 1 through 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (page 484) and the digit 8 appears once (page 488). Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the total number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, ..., up to 9 for 90-99. Similarly, from 101-200, the tens digit cycles again, and so on.\n\nIn each group of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 80-89. So, in each 100-page block, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place and 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, how many complete 100-page blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and an additional 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each of the 4 complete blocks, the tens place contributes 10 4's and 10 8's. So, 4 blocks contribute 4*10 = 40 4's and 40 8's. Now, let's look at the remaining 88 pages (401-488). The tens digit in these pages cycles from 0 to 8. Let's see where 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit is 0\n411-420: tens digit is 1\n421-430: tens digit is 2\n431-440: tens digit is 3\n441-450: tens digit is 4\n451-460: tens digit is 5\n461-470: tens digit is 6\n471-480: tens digit is 7\n481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 488 is the last page. So, 441-450 is within 401-488, so that's 10 pages where 4 is in the tens place. Similarly, 481-488 is 8 pages where 8 is in the tens place. However, since the tens digit is 8 in 481-488, that's 8 numbers, but 488 is the last page, so the tens digit is 8 for 481-488, which is 8 numbers, but wait, 481 is 4-8-1, so the tens digit is 8 for pages 481-488, which is 8 pages. But wait, 481-488 is 8 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for each of these, so that's 8 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 441-450 is 10 pages, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens place contributes 10 4's and 8 8's. Therefore, adding to the previous counts:\n\nTotal 4's in tens place: 40 (from 4 blocks) + 10 = 50\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 (from 4 blocks) + 8 = 48\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's are more than 8's by 2.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nWe need to count how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place and how many times 8 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nFirst, 8 in the hundreds place: since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nNow, for 4's in the hundreds place: the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. How many pages is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89\nTotal 8's in hundreds place: 0\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's and 8's across all digit positions.\n\nFirst, total 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8. So, 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have 4 and 8 in the units place once each. So, units place: 48 +1=49 for 4's and 48 +1=49 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: 4 complete blocks of 100, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 each. Then, the remaining 88 pages (401-488). The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The 4's in the tens place occur in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 4's. The 8's in the tens place occur in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 8's. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50, and 8's: 40 +8=48. So, 50 vs 48, difference of 2. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4's from 400-488: 89 pages, so 89 4's. 8's: 0, since the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, that's correct.\n\nAdding up 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nAdding up 8's: 49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again: 188-97. 188-90=98, then -7=91. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 91.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the range of page numbers:** Pages 1 to 488.\n\n2. **Count occurrences of digit 4 and 8 in each digit position (units, tens, hundreds).**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Each group of 10 pages contributes 1 occurrence of 4 and 1 of 8.\n     - Total groups of 10: 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8).\n     - Remaining pages (481-488): 1 occurrence each of 4 and 8.\n     - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n     - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each group of 100 pages contributes 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place.\n     - Total complete groups of 100: 4 (since 488 / 100 = 4.88).\n     - Remaining pages (401-488): \n       - 4's in tens place: 10 (pages 441-450).\n       - 8's in tens place: 8 (pages 481-488).\n     - Total 4's: 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n     - Total 8's: 4*10 + 8 = 48.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - 4's: Pages 400-488 contribute 89 occurrences.\n     - 8's: No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n     - Total 4's: 89.\n     - Total 8's: 0.\n\n3. **Sum the occurrences:**\n   - Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - Total 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n4. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{91}."

    "text": " Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each set of ten numbers. For example, from 1 to 10, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place (except 0, which appears once starting from 10). Wait, actually, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place every ten numbers. So, for each ten numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for 8.\n\nNow, how many tens are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1 (for each ten) plus any additional 4's in the last 8 numbers. Looking at 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, there's one more 4 in the units place here. So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place: in each ten numbers, there's one 8. So, 48 times 1, and in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so that's another 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that seems the same as 4's. But wait, let me check. Wait, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, so yes, 8 appears once. So units place: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nHmm, so the difference in units place is zero. So, maybe the difference comes from the tens or hundreds place.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every hundred numbers. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for each hundred numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8.\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nSo, for the tens place, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times in each hundred (80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nSo, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 times 10 = 40 4's in the tens place, and 4 times 10 = 40 8's.\n\nNow, we have the remaining 88 pages (401-488). Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nLooking at 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, let's break it down:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nSo, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? It appears in 441-450, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 times (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 481-488 is 8 numbers: 481,482,...,488, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers. So, in the tens place, in the last partial hundred (401-488), 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40 (from the four hundreds) + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 (from the four hundreds) + 8 = 48.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 48, so 4's are 2 more than 8's here.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 4 appears, since the book has 488 pages. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n\nHow many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would be where 8 appears in the hundreds place, but since the book only goes up to 488, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, and 8's appear 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (number of 4's) minus 97 (number of 8's) = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nTotal pages: 488.\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in units place: For every 10 pages, once. So 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once. So total 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nSame for 8's in units place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, and in the last 8 pages, 8 appears once. So 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for 4 and 8, each appears 10 times per hundred.\n\nThere are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). So, 4 x 10 = 40 for each digit.\n\nNow, the last partial hundred is 401-488, which is 88 pages.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times.\n\n8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 times.\n\nSo, 40 +10=50 for 4's, and 40 +8=48 for 8's. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n\n8 doesn't appear in hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89= 188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 +48 +0=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, but let me check again the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those. So 89 times. Correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 97, so 188-97=91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position separately and sum them up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a different method to verify.\n\nWait, another approach: for each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) = 48 full tens, each contributing 1, plus the remainder. 488 mod 10 is 8, so in the last partial ten, 4 appears once (at 484). So total 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: same logic, 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n\nNumber of full hundreds: floor(488/100)=4, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8.\n\nThen, the remaining pages: 488 - 400=88 pages.\n\nIn the tens place for these 88 pages, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8.\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in tens place: from 440-449, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 440-449 (10 numbers), so 10 times.\n\nNumber of times 8 appears in tens place: from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers), but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, 9 times? Wait, but earlier I thought it was 8. Hmm, let me check.\n\nWait, 480 is included, so 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, 9 times.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I thought it was 8, but now I'm seeing it's 9. Did I make a mistake earlier?\n\nWait, 480 is page 480, and 488 is page 488. So, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 pages (since 488-480+1=9). So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8. So, that would change the count.\n\nWait, let me correct that. So, in the tens place, in the last 88 pages (401-488):\n\n- For 4's: 440-449 is 10 pages, so 10 times.\n- For 8's: 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 4*10 +10=50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place:4*10 +9=49.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought 8's in tens place were 48, but now it's 49. So, I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's recalculate.\n\nWait, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-8.\n\nSo, for 4's in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place:\n\n- 4's: 4*10 +10=50\n- 8's:4*10 +9=49\n\nSo, total 4's:50, 8's:49.\n\nWait, so that changes the total counts.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, I had 49 each.\n\nIn the hundreds place:\n\n4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but now I'm getting a different answer. So, I must have made a mistake earlier in counting the 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me check again.\n\nIn the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n\nSo, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear?\n\n- 0: 401-410:10 pages\n- 1:411-420:10 pages\n- 2:421-430:10 pages\n- 3:431-440:10 pages\n- 4:441-450:10 pages\n- 5:451-460:10 pages\n- 6:461-470:10 pages\n- 7:471-480:10 pages\n- 8:481-488:8 pages\n\nWait, so from 481-488, that's 8 pages, not 9. Because 488-481+1=8.\n\nWait, 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488: that's 8 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages.\n\nSo, earlier I was correct that in the last partial hundred, 8 appears 8 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place:4*10 +8=48.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 9. It's actually 8.\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place:48.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nSo, the correct difference is 91.\n\nI think that's the right answer. Let me just go through once more to make sure.\n\nUnits place:\n- 4's:49\n- 8's:49\n\nTens place:\n- 4's:50\n- 8's:48\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's:89\n- 8's:0\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Break Down by Digit Positions:**\n   - Page numbers range from 1 to 488.\n   - We'll analyze the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n2. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 sets (480 pages).\n   - Remaining 8 pages: 481-488.\n   - **4's:** 48 times in complete sets + 1 in 484 \u2192 49.\n   - **8's:** 48 times in complete sets + 1 in 488 \u2192 49.\n\n3. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - Complete hundreds: 4 sets (1-400).\n   - Remaining 88 pages: 401-488.\n   - **4's:** 4*10=40 + 10 in 441-450 \u2192 50.\n   - **8's:** 4*10=40 + 8 in 481-488 \u2192 48.\n\n4. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Only pages 400-488 have the hundreds digit as 4.\n   - **4's:** 89 times (400-488).\n   - **8's:** 0 times.\n\n5. **Total Counts:**\n   - **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n6. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4). From 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. So, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10 and an extra 8 pages (481-488). In each of the 48 full groups, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), I check if there's a 4 in the units place. 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Here, the digit 4 appears in a block of 10 numbers. For example, from 40-49, each of these 10 numbers has a 4 in the tens place. So, each such block contributes 10 4's. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, the first block is 40-49, the next would be 140-149, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. Let me count these blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each contributes 10 4's, so 5 * 10 = 50. Now, I should check if there are any partial blocks beyond 449. The next block would be 540-549, but since 540 is beyond 488, we don't have that. So, total 4's in the tens place are 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 in the hundreds place occurs from page 400 to 488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the 4's from units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll follow the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, every group of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups and 8 extra pages. Each group contributes one 8, so 48. In the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digit is 8 on page 488. So, that's one more. So, total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. These blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but 480-489 is within 488, so that's valid. Let me count these blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 8's, so 5 * 10 = 50. Now, check if there are any partial blocks beyond 489, but since 488 is the last page, 480-489 is fully included except for 489 being beyond 488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for all, so that's 9 numbers, but since we're counting the digit 8 in the tens place, each of these 9 numbers contributes one 8 in the tens place. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Earlier, I considered 5 blocks each with 10 8's, but 480-489 would have 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, the last block is only up to 488. So, the 480-489 block would contribute 9 8's in the tens place, not 10. So, I need to adjust that.\n\nWait, let me think again. The blocks are:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place.\n- 180-189: 10 numbers, 10 8's.\n- 280-289: 10 numbers, 10 8's.\n- 380-389: 10 numbers, 10 8's.\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place would be 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, so 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial thought. So, I think I need to correct that. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 8's, that's 4*10=40. The fifth block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 5 blocks each contributing 10, but that's incorrect because the last block doesn't have 10 numbers. So, the correct count is 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would occur from page 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the 8's from units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus, in the last 8 pages (481-488), 484 has a 4 in the units place, so +1, total 49. That seems correct.\n\n- Tens place: 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That's correct.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus, in the last 8 pages, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so +1, total 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, as there are no pages from 800-888. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 8's. Let me verify the blocks again.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the tens digit is 8 in the following ranges:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the tens place.\n\n- 180-189: 10 numbers.\n\n- 280-289: 10 numbers.\n\n- 380-389: 10 numbers.\n\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive).\n\nSo, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 4*10 + 9 = 49. That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's in the tens place, the blocks are:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers.\n\n- 140-149: 10.\n\n- 240-249: 10.\n\n- 340-349: 10.\n\n- 440-449: 10.\n\nWait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers, correct. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. That's correct.\n\nWait, but when I counted the 4's in the hundreds place, I considered 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Let me confirm: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 4's.\n\nAnd for 8's, 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the 8's in the tens place, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but does each of these numbers have an 8 in the tens place? Let me check a few examples:\n\n- 480: tens digit is 8.\n\n- 481: tens digit is 8.\n\n...\n\n- 488: tens digit is 8.\n\nYes, each of these 9 numbers has an 8 in the tens place, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's in the hundreds place, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 numbers.\n\nWait, but I just realized something else. When counting the 4's in the tens place, the block 440-449: each of these 10 numbers has a 4 in the tens place, right? So, that's correct.\n\nI think my counts are accurate. So, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 48 full groups of 10 (480) + 1 in 481-488 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449) \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 400-488 = 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 48 full groups of 10 (480) + 1 in 481-488 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) + 9 in 480-488 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each position, except possibly the last set if the total number isn't a multiple of 10. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 groups * 1 = 48, plus any 4's in the remaining 8 numbers. Looking at 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so only 484 has a 4 in the units place. So that's 1 more 4, making the total 49 4's in the units place. Similarly, for 8's, in the remaining 8 numbers, the units digit 8 is present in 488, so that's 1 more 8, making the total 49 8's in the units place as well. Wait, but let me check that again. Each complete group of 10 contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 groups give 48 each. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the digit in the tens place goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for each digit, it appears 10 times in the tens place per 100 numbers. So, for 488 pages, we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). Let's calculate the number of 4's and 8's in the tens place.\n\nFirst, in the full hundreds (1-400), each hundred block contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for the digit 4, in each hundred, it appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4 hundreds would have 4 * 10 = 40 4's in the tens place. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4 * 10 = 40 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), we need to check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place. Let's break it down:\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last). So, the tens digits go through 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). \n\nIn the tens place, the digit 4 appears once in 441-450, which is 10 times. But wait, 441-450 is 10 numbers, so the tens digit is 4 for 10 times. However, since our range is up to 488, and 450 is included, so yes, 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 8 times. Wait, but wait, 481-488 is 8 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for each, so 8 occurrences. But wait, 481-488 is 8 numbers: 481, 482, ..., 488. So, the tens digit is 8 in each, so 8 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: in the range 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, from 401-488, the digit 4 appears 10 times, and the digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, total in the tens place:\n\n4's: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50.\n\n8's: 40 (from 1-400) + 8 (from 401-488) = 48.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Wait, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. The tens digit is 8 in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 8's. So yes, 10 and 8 respectively.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 50 4's and 48 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so 0 times. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's. From 200-299, hundreds digit is 2, same thing. From 300-399, hundreds digit is 3. From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in the range 1-488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49\n\nTens place: 50\n\nHundreds place: 89\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49\n\nTens place: 48\n\nHundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems a bit high. Let me go through each step again.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last group, 488 has an 8, so 1 more, total 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1-400, each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds: 4*10=40 for both 4 and 8.\n\nFrom 401-488:\n\nTens digit 4 occurs in 441-450: 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\nTens digit 8 occurs in 481-488: 8 numbers, so 8 8's.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 40+10=50 for 4's, and 40+8=48 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears 89 times (from 400-488), 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this, maybe by calculating the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit place, calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) + (if last partial group has >=4, add 1). Wait, but 488/10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. Then, the last partial group is 481-488, which has units digits 1-8. Since 4 is within 1-8, we add 1. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly for 8's: floor(488/10) = 48, and the last partial group has 8, so 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, in each hundred, 10 times. So, 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10. So, total 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place: 4 hundreds give 40, and in the last partial hundred, 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8. So, 40 +8=48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nNumber of 8's: 0, since 800-899 isn't included.\n\nSo, adding up, same as before.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 91.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the answer.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then considering the remainder. So, for the units place, every 10 pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. So, for 488 pages, how many complete groups of 10 are there? That's 488 divided by 10, which is 48 complete groups, with 8 pages remaining.\n\nIn each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48. But wait, there are 8 remaining pages after 480, which are 481 to 488. So, in these 8 pages, the units digits are 1 through 8. So, in the units place of these remaining pages, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the total number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is included, so 8 appears once more. Hmm, but wait, 488 is a three-digit number, so maybe I should consider that separately. Wait, no, the units digit is just the last digit, so 488's units digit is 8, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 1 to 480, the units digit cycles every 10, so 48 times 10, so 48 times each digit appears in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, units place: 4's = 48 + 1 = 49, 8's = 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both digits appear the same number of times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages, with each digit from 0 to 9 appearing 10 times in each hundred. So, for the tens place, each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages. Let me see, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages from 401 to 488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in each hundred (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for each hundred, 10 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place. Since there are 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 for each digit. Now, what about the remaining 88 pages from 401 to 488? The tens digit in these pages ranges from 0 (401-410, where the tens digit is 0) up to 8 (480-488, where the tens digit is 8). Wait, actually, from 401 to 488, the tens digits go through 0 to 8 in each set of 10 pages.\n\nWait, 401-410: tens digit is 0\n411-420: tens digit is 1\n...\n481-490: tens digit is 8, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages (481-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place from 401-488? Let's see, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. But wait, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 in the tens place occurs in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 times (480-488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 pages: 480,481,...,488. Wait, 480 is included, right? So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total in the tens place: 4's = 4*10 (from the four hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50, and 8's = 4*10 (from four hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, the four hundreds each contribute 10 times each digit in the tens place, so 4*10=40 for both 4 and 8. Then, in the remaining 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total in the tens place: 4's = 40 + 10 = 50, 8's = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me think again. From 1 to 400, each hundred contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place, so 4 appears 4*10=40 times, and 8 appears 4*10=40 times. Then, from 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digit for 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times, and for 8, it's in 480-488, which is 9 times. So yes, 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place? The digit 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, now, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's, so 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- 488 / 10 = 48 full groups, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 and 8 in the units place, so 48 each.\n- Remaining 8 pages: 481-488. Units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place, so 4*10=40 for 4 and 40 for 8.\n- From 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 times.\n- So, 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488)\n- 8 appears 0 times\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears equally in the units place every 10 pages.\n   - For 488 pages, there are 48 complete groups of 10, contributing 48 occurrences of each digit.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add 1 more 4 and 1 more 8.\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 pages.\n   - For 488 pages, there are 4 complete hundreds, contributing 40 occurrences of each digit.\n   - From 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0\n\nSumming these up:\n- Total 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- Total 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 more times than the digit 8. \n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each position, I'll calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block, the digit 4 appears once (like in 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the digit 8 appears once (like in 8, 18, 28, etc.). \n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488 pages. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and an additional 8 pages (481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so for 48 blocks, that's 48 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 48 times in the units place. \n\nNow, looking at the incomplete block from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial block, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). \n\nSo, total units place contributions:\n- 4's: 48 (from complete blocks) + 1 (from partial block) = 49\n- 8's: 48 (from complete blocks) + 1 (from partial block) = 49\n\nWait, that's the same. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me double-check. Wait, no, actually, 488 is included, so from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So yes, 484 is the only 4 and 488 is the only 8 in the units place for that partial block. So, units place gives 49 4's and 49 8's. So, no difference here.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears in the tens place 10 times in each block of 100. So, for example, in the 100s, the tens digit is 0 for 100-109, 1 for 110-119, ..., 9 for 190-199. So, each digit appears 10 times per 100 numbers.\n\nNow, let's see how many complete hundreds we have. Since the book has 488 pages, we have four complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Then, we have an additional 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for four hundreds, that's 4*10=40 times for each digit. \n\nNow, looking at the partial hundred from 401-488. The tens digit here goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Only in 440-449, which is 10 times. Similarly, how many times does 8 appear? In 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, actually, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. Wait, but the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but the digit 8 in the tens place appears 9 times? Wait, no, each number in 480-488 has 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, 9 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit, the number of times it appears is 10 except for the last one, which is only 9 because we stop at 488.\n\nSo, for the digit 4 in the tens place in 401-488: it's only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the tens place: it's in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place contributions:\n- 4's: 40 (from four complete hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50\n- 8's: 40 (from four complete hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. That's a difference of 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all pages from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nThe digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if there were pages beyond 488, but since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total hundreds place contributions:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nSo, now, let's sum up the counts from each digit position.\n\nUnits place:\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 49\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, let me check that addition again.\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nFirst, units place: 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8. So, 48 each. Then, the partial block from 481-488: units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units total: 48+1=49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nTens place: Each complete hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's. Four complete hundreds: 4*10=40 each. Then, the partial hundred from 401-488: 440-449 is 10 4's, and 480-488 is 9 8's. So, 40+10=50 for 4's, and 40+9=49 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. 8's: 0.\n\nSo, adding up: 4's: 49+50+89=188, 8's:49+49+0=98. Difference: 188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Each number from 400 to 488 has 4 in the hundreds place. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nAnother way to approach this might be to consider each digit position separately and calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write a formula or a systematic way to count the occurrences.\n\nFor the units place:\n- The number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N can be calculated as:\n  - Complete cycles: (N // 10) * 1\n  - Partial cycle: max(0, min(N % 10, d) - (d if d <= N % 10 else 0)) ? Wait, maybe it's better to think as:\n  - For each digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place is:\n    - Complete cycles: (N // 10) * 1\n    - Plus 1 if the remainder (N % 10) >= d, else 0.\n\nWait, no, actually, for each digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to N is:\n- Complete cycles: (N // 10) * 1\n- Plus, if the remainder (N % 10) >= d, then 1, else 0.\n\nSo, for d=4, N=488:\n- Complete cycles: 488 // 10 = 48\n- Remainder: 488 % 10 = 8\n- Since 8 >=4, add 1. So, total 49.\n\nSimilarly for d=8:\n- Complete cycles: 48\n- Remainder:8\n- Since 8 >=8, add 1. So, total 49.\n\nThat matches what I had before.\n\nFor the tens place:\nThe formula is similar but considering the tens digit. The number of times a digit d appears in the tens place up to N is:\n- Complete hundreds: (N // 100) * 10\n- Remainder: (N % 100)\n- If the tens digit in N is >= d, then add the number of times d appears in the tens place up to that point. Wait, maybe it's better to think as:\n- For each hundred block, the digit d appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 0-9 in tens place for each hundred).\n- Then, for the partial hundred, if the tens digit is >= d, add the number of times from 0 to the tens digit. Wait, perhaps more accurately:\n- Let\u2019s denote the number as ABC, where A is hundreds, B is tens, C is units.\n- The count for digit d in tens place is:\n  - (A) * 10\n  - Plus, if B > d, add 10\n  - If B == d, add (C + 1)\n  - If B < d, add 0\n\nWait, maybe it's better to use a formula. Let me see.\n\nFor the tens place, the count is:\n- Let high = N // 100\n- current = (N // 10) % 10\n- low = N % 10\n\nIf current > d: count = (high + 1) * 10\nIf current == d: count = high * 10 + (low + 1)\nIf current < d: count = high * 10\n\nBut we have to adjust for d=0, but since we're starting from page 1, maybe it's a bit different. Wait, actually, page 1 is 001 if we consider three digits, but the first page is 1, which is just '1', so maybe the hundreds digit isn't present until page 100. Hmm, perhaps it's better to adjust the formula for N=488.\n\nSo, for d=4 in tens place:\n\nhigh = 488 // 100 = 4\ncurrent = (488 // 10) % 10 = 8 % 10 = 8\nlow = 488 % 10 = 8\n\nSince current (8) > d (4), the count is (high + 1) * 10 = (4 + 1)*10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8 in tens place:\n\nhigh =4\ncurrent=8\nlow=8\n\nSince current (8) >= d (8), we use the formula:\ncount = high * 10 + (low + 1) = 4*10 + (8+1) = 40 +9=49.\n\nThat matches what I had before: 50 for 4's and 49 for 8's in the tens place.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\nThe count for digit d in hundreds place is:\n- high = N // 1000\n- current = (N // 100) % 10\n- If current > d: count = (high + 1) * 100\n- If current == d: count = high * 100 + (N % 100 + 1)\n- If current < d: count = high * 100\n\nBut since N=488, which is less than 1000, high =0, current=4.\n\nFor d=4:\ncurrent=4, so count=0*100 + (488 % 100 +1)= 88 +1=89.\n\nFor d=8:\ncurrent=4 <8, so count=0*100=0.\n\nSo, that's correct: 89 for 4's and 0 for 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up:\n- 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188\n- 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0 (hundreds)=98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nI think this is correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each place and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of ten numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the digits 1-9 appear once each, and 0 appears once. But since we're starting from 1, maybe I should adjust for that. Wait, actually, when considering the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in each group of ten, except maybe the last group if the total isn't a multiple of ten.\n\nSo, for the units place, the number of times 4 appears would be equal to the number of complete groups of ten, plus any extra in the incomplete group. Similarly for 8.\n\nLet me formalize this. The total number of page numbers is 488. So, the number of complete groups of ten is 488 divided by 10, which is 48 groups, with 8 remaining pages (488 = 48*10 + 8). So, in each digit place, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times in the complete groups. Now, for the incomplete group, which is 8 pages (481-488), I need to see how many 4's and 8's are in the units place here.\n\nWait, actually, let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a particular digit appears can be calculated by considering how many full cycles of 10, 100, etc., there are, and then the remaining part.\n\nSo, for the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's = number of complete tens * 1 (since each ten contributes one 4 in the units place) + number of 4's in the remaining pages.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's = same approach.\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nLet me try to calculate the number of 4's first.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nTotal number of complete groups of ten is 488 // 10 = 48 groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 * 1 = 48.\n\nThen, the remaining pages after 480 are 481 to 488, which is 8 pages. Now, in the units place of these, how many 4's? Looking at 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, only 484 has a 4 in the units place. So, that's one more 4. So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, 488 // 10 is 48, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, only 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's +1. So, total 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place:\n\nNumber of complete groups of ten is 48, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48.\n\nThen, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's +1. So, total 8's in units place: 48 +1 =49.\n\nWait, but hold on, 488 is the last page, so when I'm counting the units place for 8's, 488 is included, so yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but wait, 488 is page number 488, so the units digit is 8, so that's correct. So, both 4's and 8's in the units place occur 49 times each.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So, same count for units place. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), for 4's, only 484 has a 4, and for 8's, only 488 has an 8. So, both get +1, making it 49 each.\n\nOkay, moving on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, for example, in 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (40-49), and similarly for 8.\n\nSo, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear?\n\nTotal number of complete hundreds is 4 (since 488 is less than 500). Wait, actually, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, perhaps it's better to think in terms of hundreds.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to calculate how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nEach digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each.\n\nSo, for 1-100, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49).\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n\nNow, since the book has 488 pages, which is 4 full hundreds (1-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nSo, in the tens place, for each hundred (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and similarly 8 appears 10 times.\n\nSo, for 400 pages, that's 4 hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40 times for 4's, and 4 * 10 = 40 times for 8's.\n\nNow, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), we need to see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit can be from 0 to 8, but let's see:\n\n401-410: tens digit is 0\n411-420: tens digit is 1\n...\n481-488: tens digit is 8.\n\nWait, but actually, from 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8, but each ten's group is 10 numbers, except the last one which is 8 numbers (481-488).\n\nSo, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear?\n\nIn the tens place, 4 would appear in the 440-449 range. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? 440 is page 440, which is within 401-488, and 449 is page 449, which is also within. So, that's 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears in the tens place in 480-489. But wait, our range is up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, from 480 to 488. Wait, no, 480 is 480, 481 is 481, etc., so the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Wait, but 480 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for each of these 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times, except for the last digit, which is 8, appearing 9 times because we only go up to 488.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. But in 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but each digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for 8, which appears 8 times? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate how many times each digit appears in the tens place from 401 to 488.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1 (10 numbers)\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2 (10 numbers)\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3 (10 numbers)\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4 (10 numbers)\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5 (10 numbers)\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6 (10 numbers)\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7 (10 numbers)\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8 (8 numbers)\n\nSo, from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 0 for 10 numbers, 1 for 10, 2 for 10, 3 for 10, 4 for 10, 5 for 10, 6 for 10, 7 for 10, and 8 for 8 numbers.\n\nTherefore, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in 401-488, and the digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place in 481-488.\n\nSo, total for the tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: in 1-400, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40. Plus in 401-488, another 10 times, so total 50.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, 1-400 is 400 pages, so in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4*10=40 times.\n\nThen, in 401-488, as we saw, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450). So, total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\nIn 1-400, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40.\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, total 8's in tens place: 40 +8=48.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 times for 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but wait, 480 is included in 401-488, right? So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 times.\n\nWait, so that would make total 8's in tens place: 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8 times. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 times, not 8. So, that's correct. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, but that's incorrect because 480 is also included, making it 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, number of 4's in tens place: 50, and 8's:49.\n\nWait, so 4's are more by 1 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, digits can be 1,2,3,4 since the book has 488 pages.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place:89, and 8's:0.\n\nSo, now, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:49+50+89= 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big difference, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, let's recalculate the 4's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:50\n\nHundreds place:89\n\nTotal:49+50=99; 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:49\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times.\n\nAnd 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 4's:50, 8's:49.\n\nUnits place: both 49.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's:49+50+89=188\n\n8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 times for 4's and 10 times for 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40 for 4's and 4*10=40 for 8's.\n\nThen, from 401-488, 4's in tens place:10 times (441-450), so total 50.\n\nFor 8's in tens place, from 401-488, it's 9 times (480-488), so total 40+9=49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nUnits place:48 complete groups of ten, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So, total 49 each.\n\nSo, yes, the calculations seem correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place for complete groups of ten (1-480).\n   - In the remaining 8 pages (481-488), 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred. For 1-400, each digit appears 40 times (4 hundreds \u00d7 10).\n   - From 401-488:\n     - 4 appears 10 times (441-450).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by calculating the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4). From 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. Now, I need to figure out how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488 pages. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each complete set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, units place contributes 48 fours.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, every number has a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 times. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, each hundred has one such block. So, from 1-100, 40-49 is one block. From 101-200, 140-149 is another. From 201-300, 240-249. From 301-400, 340-349. From 401-488, 440-449. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so the last block is only up to 488. Let me count the number of blocks. Each hundred has one block, so from 1-400, there are four blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). Then, from 401-488, the next block would be 440-449, which is within 488, so that's another block. So, total blocks are five, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. But wait, let me check the last block. From 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, that's 10 fours. So, tens place contributes 50 fours.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, but hold on. I think I made a mistake here. Because when considering the hundreds place, only numbers where the hundreds digit is 4 will contribute. So, from 400 to 488, yes, each of those numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. 400 is the first number with 4 in the hundreds place, and 488 is the last. So, the count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, adding up the fours from each place:\n\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\n\nTotal number of fours = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, actually, I think I made a mistake in the tens place. Because for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, from 1-100, 40-49 is 10 fours. From 101-200, 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). So that's five blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5\u00d710=50. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, units place: Each 10 numbers have one 4, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing 1 four, so 48 fours. The last 8 numbers (481-488) don't have a 4 in the units place, so that's correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours.\n\nSo, total fours: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with units place: Similar to fours, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-10, page 8. From 11-20, page 18, etc. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. So, 48 eights in the units place. The last 8 numbers (481-488) include page 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's an additional 1 eight. So, units place contributes 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning there are 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. Then, the remaining 8 numbers are 481-488. In these, the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once (page 488). So, total units place eights: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for an entire block of 100 numbers. For example, from 80-89, every number has an 8 in the tens place. That's 10 times. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Each hundred has one such block. So, from 1-100, 80-89 is one block (10 eights). From 101-200, 180-189 is another (10). From 201-300, 280-289 (10). From 301-400, 380-389 (10). From 401-488, the next block would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, so in the last block, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 eights instead of 10.\n\nSo, total tens place eights: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 from the last partial block, totaling 49 eights.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1-100: 80-89 (10). 101-200: 180-189 (10). 201-300: 280-289 (10). 301-400: 380-389 (10). 401-488: 480-488 (9). So, that's 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, there are zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total eights:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal eights = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 eights in the tens place. So, adding up: 4 blocks of 10, which is 40, plus 9, totaling 49. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought that in the units place, from 481-488, page 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's an extra 1, making units place 49. Then, tens place is 49, so total eights are 98.\n\nNow, total fours were 187, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, fours:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187.\n\nEights:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 89 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly for fours? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct.\n\nFor eights, hundreds place: none, since 800-899 isn't included. So, zero.\n\nTens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\nUnits place: 48 full decades, each contributing 1 eight, and then in the last 8 numbers (481-488), page 488 has an 8 in units, so 48 +1 =49.\n\nSo, yes, 49 +49=98 eights.\n\nSo, 187 fours minus 98 eights equals 89 more fours.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to calculate this, just to cross-verify.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units place: floor(488/10) = 48 full cycles, each contributing 1 four. Plus, check if the remainder (8) is >=4? No, because 488 mod 10 is 8, which is less than 4? Wait, no, wait. The formula for counting digits in a specific place is a bit different.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use a more systematic approach.\n\nThe formula for counting the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is:\n\nnumber of complete groups of 10 = N // 10\nremainder = N % 10\ncount = number of complete groups * 1\nif remainder >= d, count +=1\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\nnumber of complete groups of 100 = N // 100\nremainder = N % 100\ncount = number of complete groups * 10\nif remainder >= d*10, count += (remainder - d*10 +1)\nelse, count += (remainder - d*10 +1) if remainder >=d*10 else 0\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating, but let's try applying this.\n\nFor fours in units place:\n\nN=488, d=4.\n\nnumber of complete groups of 10 = 488 // 10 = 48\nremainder = 488 % 10 =8\ncount = 48 *1 =48\nsince remainder (8) >=4, add 1, so total 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place fours were 48, but according to this, it's 49.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier calculation. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let's take a smaller example. From 1-10, how many fours? Page 4, so 1. Using the formula: 10//10=1, remainder=0. So, count=1*1=1. Since remainder (0) <4, don't add anything. So, total 1, which is correct.\n\nFrom 1-14: 14//10=1, remainder=4. So, count=1*1=1. Since remainder >=4, add 1. So, total 2 fours: 4 and 14. Correct.\n\nSo, applying to N=488, d=4.\n\nUnits place:\n\n488//10=48, remainder=8.\n\ncount=48*1=48.\n\nSince 8 >=4, add 1, so 49 fours in units place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place fours were 48. That was a mistake. So, I need to correct that.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in units place:\n\nN=488, d=8.\n\n488//10=48, remainder=8.\n\ncount=48*1=48.\n\nSince remainder=8 >=8, add 1. So, total 49 eights in units place.\n\nWait, so earlier I had units place fours as 48, but it's actually 49. Similarly, units place eights are 49.\n\nWait, so I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate.\n\nSo, fours:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: Let's recalculate.\n\nFor tens place, using the formula:\n\nnumber of complete groups of 100 = 488 // 100 =4\nremainder = 488 % 100 =88\ncount =4 *10=40\nsince d=4, we check if remainder >=4*10=40. 88 >=40, so add (88 -40 +1)=49\nso total tens place fours=40+49=89.\n\nWait, that can't be right because from 1-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349, and 440-449. So, that's five blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. But according to the formula, it's 40 +49=89, which is way too high.\n\nWait, I think I'm misapplying the formula. The formula is for counting the number of times a digit appears in a specific position, but perhaps I'm confusing the digit with the position.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should use a different approach.\n\nWait, the formula for the tens place is:\n\nFor each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, from 1-100: 40-49 (10). 101-200:140-149 (10). 201-300:240-249 (10). 301-400:340-349 (10). 401-488:440-449 (10). So, that's five blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, it's 4 complete hundreds (400) and then 88 remainder. So, 4*10=40, and since 88 >=40, add 88-40+1=49. So, total 89. That's conflicting with the actual count of 50.\n\nWait, so perhaps the formula is for counting the number of times a digit appears in a specific position up to N, not per digit. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the formula.\n\nWait, maybe I should use a different approach. Let me try to count manually.\n\nFrom 1-100: tens place fours: 10 (40-49)\n101-200:10 (140-149)\n201-300:10 (240-249)\n301-400:10 (340-349)\n401-488:10 (440-449)\nTotal: 5\u00d710=50 fours in tens place.\n\nSo, the formula must have been applied incorrectly earlier. So, the correct count is 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the tens place:\n\nFrom 1-100: 80-89 (10)\n101-200:180-189 (10)\n201-300:280-289 (10)\n301-400:380-389 (10)\n401-488:480-488 (9)\nTotal:4\u00d710 +9=49 eights in tens place.\n\nSo, now, let's correct the earlier counts.\n\nFours:\n\n- Units place: Using the correct formula, it's 49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89 (from 400-488)\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nWait, earlier I thought units place fours were 48, but according to the formula, it's 49. So, that's a correction.\n\nEights:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, now, the difference is 188 fours -98 eights=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89. So, I must have made a mistake in the units place fours.\n\nWait, let's clarify. Using the formula for units place fours:\n\nN=488, d=4.\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10:488//10=48\nRemainder:488%10=8\n\nCount=48*1=48\nSince remainder >=4, add 1, so total 49 fours in units place.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, units place fours=49.\n\nTens place fours=50\nHundreds place fours=89\nTotal fours=49+50+89=188.\n\nEights:\n\nUnits place=49\nTens place=49\nHundreds place=0\nTotal eights=98.\n\nDifference=188-98=90.\n\nWait, so the correct answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89. So, where did I go wrong before?\n\nI think the initial mistake was in the units place fours. I had thought it was 48, but it's actually 49 because the remainder is 8, which is >=4, so we add 1 more.\n\nSimilarly, let's check eights in units place:\n\nN=488, d=8.\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10:488//10=48\nRemainder=488%10=8\n\nCount=48*1=48\nSince remainder >=8, add 1, so total 49 eights in units place.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, now, with the correct counts:\n\nFours:49+50+89=188\nEights:49+49=98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\nTo solve this, we calculate the number of times each digit appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 fours. The remainder (8) includes another 4, so total units place fours = 49.\n- **Tens place:** For every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), contributing 50 fours.\n- **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 fours.\n- **Total fours:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** For every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. There are 48 complete sets, contributing 48 eights. The remainder (8) includes another 8, so total units place eights = 49.\n- **Tens place:** For every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. There are 4 such blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), contributing 40 eights. From 400-488, 480-488 contributes 9 eights, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** There are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place up to 488.\n- **Total eights:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of ten numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4) and 8 appears once (page 8). This pattern repeats every ten numbers. Now, I need to figure out how many complete groups of ten there are in 488 pages and then see if there's a partial group.\n\nThe total number of pages is 488, so the number of complete groups of ten is 48 (since 48*10=480), and then there are 8 more pages (481-488). So, for the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times in each position except for the last partial group. But wait, actually, for each position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of complete cycles is 48, except for the hundreds place, which might have a different count because the hundreds digit can go up to 4 (since 488 is the last page). Let me clarify.\n\nWait, maybe I should handle each digit position separately.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in units place: For each complete group of ten, 4 appears once. There are 48 complete groups (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups). So, 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once more (page 484). So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, number of times 8 appears in units place: 48 times in complete groups, and in the remaining 8 pages, 8 appears once (page 488). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place. Hmm, that's interesting. So, the difference so far is 0.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in a group of 100. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). Now, how many hundreds do we have in 488 pages? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: In each complete hundred, 10 times. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40. But wait, actually, each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, in the remaining pages 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-488). So, in this partial block, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 pages (440-449). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each for 10 pages except the last one, which is 8 for 9 pages (481-488). Wait, no, 481-488 is 8 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place, not 10. So, actually, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and the tens digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, total 4's in tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50. 8's in tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Each complete hundred (1-100, etc.) contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for the 4's, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 more 4's. For the 8's, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488), but wait, 480 is part of 401-488, so 480-488 is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480 is included in 401-488, so the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 9 more 8's. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 481-488 is 8 pages, but actually, 480 is included, making it 9 pages. So, 9 more 8's in the tens place in the last partial block.\n\nSo, 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, the difference so far between 4's and 8's in tens place is 50 - 49 = 1.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, the digits go from 0 to 4, since the book goes up to 488. Wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is non-zero only from 100 onwards.\n\nNumber of 4's in hundreds place: From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNumber of 8's in hundreds place: Well, in the hundreds place, the digit can only be 0,1,2,3,4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\n8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each digit position.\n\nUnits place: 49 - 49 = 0.\n\nTens place: 50 - 49 = 1.\n\nHundreds place: 89 - 0 = 89.\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems a bit high, but maybe it's correct.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 89 4's. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, I had 50 4's and 49 8's, so a difference of 1.\n\nIn the units place, both had 49, so no difference.\n\nSo, total difference is 89 +1 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 9 more 8's in the tens place, making it 40 +9=49. 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50. So, 50-49=1. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position might be more accurate.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit position, we can calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nTotal number of page numbers: 488.\n\nNumber of times a digit appears in the units place: For each digit d, it appears floor(488/10) times, plus 1 if d \u2264 (488 mod 10).\n\nSo, for 4: floor(488/10)=48, and since 4 \u2264 8, we add 1. So, 49 times.\n\nFor 8: floor(488/10)=48, and since 8 \u22648, add 1. So, 49 times.\n\nSo, units place: 49 each, difference 0.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of times a digit appears in the tens place: floor(488/100)*10 + (if the tens digit is >= the digit, then add the excess).\n\nWait, perhaps a better formula is:\n\nFor the tens place, the number of times a digit d appears is:\n\nnumber = floor(488 / 100) * 10\n\nremainder = 488 % 100\n\nif d < (remainder / 10), then add 10\n\nelse if d == (remainder / 10), then add (remainder % 10 + 1)\n\nelse, add 0.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently.\n\nThe tens digit cycles every 100 numbers, with each digit appearing 10 times in each cycle. So, for the tens place, the number of complete cycles is floor(488 / 100) = 4 (since 4*100=400). So, each digit appears 4*10=40 times.\n\nThen, the remaining pages are 488 - 400 = 88 pages, from 401 to 488.\n\nIn these 88 pages, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). So, for each digit d in the tens place, we need to see how many times it appears in 401-488.\n\nFor d=4: The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 10 times.\n\nFor d=8: The tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 488 is included). So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total for tens place:\n\n4's: 40 +10=50\n\n8's:40 +9=49\n\nDifference: 50-49=1.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nAs before, from 1-99, hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so 4 appears 89 times (488-400+1=89).\n\n8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so hundreds digit only goes up to 4.\n\nSo, 4's:89, 8's:0, difference 89.\n\nAdding up the differences:\n\nUnits:0\n\nTens:1\n\nHundreds:89\n\nTotal:0+1+89=90.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's. Correct.\n\nAnd 8's in hundreds place:0.\n\nSo, yes, 89 difference from hundreds place.\n\nTens place:50-49=1.\n\nUnits place:49-49=0.\n\nTotal:89+1=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), we determine that 4 appears 138 times and 8 appears 48 times, resulting in a difference of 90 more 4's.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 groups.\n   - Remaining pages: 8 (481-488).\n   - **4's:** 48 (complete groups) + 1 (484) = 49.\n   - **8's:** 48 (complete groups) + 1 (488) = 49.\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete hundreds: 4 (1-400).\n   - Remaining pages: 88 (401-488).\n   - **4's:** 4*10=40 + 10 (440-449) = 50.\n   - **8's:** 4*10=40 + 9 (480-488) = 49.\n   - Difference: 1.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488: 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Difference: 89.\n\n4. **Total Difference:**\n   - Units: 0\n   - Tens: 1\n   - Hundreds: 89\n   - **Total:** 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the answer.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each place for both digits (4 and 8) and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For each set of ten numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in every block of ten consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then adjusting for any remaining pages.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to calculate how many times each digit appears in each position separately. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, for the digit 4:\n\n1. Units place: I need to count how many times 4 appears in the units digit across all page numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Well, every 10 numbers, there's exactly one such number (like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). So, how many such numbers are there? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 484 count as the last one? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, that's 48 times. But wait, does 484 end with 4? Yes, because 484 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 4 units. So, yes, the units digit is 4. So, 48 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then 14, 24,..., 484. The number of terms in this sequence can be found by (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Oh, so I was wrong earlier. It's 49 times. Because 484 is the 49th term. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page. So, 484 is the last number ending with 4 before 488. So, 4,14,24,...,484. Let's see, the number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times.\n\nOkay, so units place for 4: 49 times.\n\nNow, tens place: How many times does 4 appear in the tens digit? The tens digit is the second digit from the right. So, for example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all ten numbers. Similarly, in 140-149, 240-249, etc.\n\nSo, let's see how many such blocks exist in 1-488.\n\nFirst, from 0-99: 40-49 is one block, so that's 10 times.\n\nThen, from 100-199: 140-149 is another block, another 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, 240-249: another 10 times.\n\n340-349: another 10 times.\n\n440-449: another 10 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine.\n\nSo, how many such blocks are there? Let's count:\n\n- 40-49: 10\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249: 10\n- 340-349: 10\n- 440-449: 10\n\nThat's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 times. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times.\n\nWait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, tens place for 4: 50 times.\n\nNow, hundreds place: How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds digit? The hundreds digit is the third digit from the right. So, in numbers from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4.\n\nSo, from 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers.\n\nWait, but wait: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm: 400 is the first number with hundreds digit 4, and 488 is the last. So, the count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nSo, hundreds place for 4: 89 times.\n\nNow, total number of times 4 appears: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188.\n\nWait, 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4 appears 188 times.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8.\n\nStarting with units place: How many times does 8 appear in the units digit from 1 to 488?\n\nSimilarly, every 10 numbers, there's one 8 in the units place. So, from 8,18,28,...,488.\n\nWait, 488 is the last page, so 488 ends with 8, so that's included.\n\nSo, how many terms are there in this sequence?\n\nThe first term is 8, the last term is 488.\n\nThe sequence is 8,18,28,...,488.\n\nThis is an arithmetic sequence where the first term a1=8, common difference d=10, last term l=488.\n\nThe number of terms n can be found by:\n\nn = ((l - a1)/d) + 1\n\nSo, (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 =48 +1=49.\n\nSo, 49 times.\n\nSo, units place for 8: 49 times.\n\nNow, tens place: How many times does 8 appear in the tens digit?\n\nSimilarly, for each block where the tens digit is 8, like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489.\n\nWait, but our book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the last block.\n\nSo, let's count how many such blocks are fully contained within 1-488, and then see if the last block is partial.\n\nFirst, 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\n180-189: another 10.\n\n280-289: another 10.\n\n380-389: another 10.\n\n480-489: but our book ends at 488, so only 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers, because 488 -480 +1=9).\n\nWait, no: 480 is the first, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488: that's 9 numbers, right? Because from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, not 10.\n\nSo, for the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place, we have:\n\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo, total for tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49 times.\n\nWait, let me add them up: 10+10=20, +10=30, +10=40, +9=49.\n\nSo, tens place for 8: 49 times.\n\nNow, hundreds place: How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds digit?\n\nIn a 488-page book, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), 4 (400-488). So, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 8 does not appear in the hundreds place at all.\n\nSo, hundreds place for 8: 0 times.\n\nTherefore, total number of times 8 appears: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nWait, so 4 appears 188 times, and 8 appears 98 times.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, for the digit 4:\n\nUnits: 49 times.\n\nTens: 50 times.\n\nHundreds:89 times.\n\nTotal:49+50=99, +89=188.\n\nFor 8:\n\nUnits:49.\n\nTens:49.\n\nHundreds:0.\n\nTotal:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, seems correct, but let me check again, maybe I made a mistake in counting the tens place for 4 or 8.\n\nWait, for 4 in the tens place, I had 5 blocks: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block contributes 10 times, so 5*10=50.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place, I had 4 full blocks (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) each contributing 10, and the last block 480-488 contributing 9, so total 4*10 +9=49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nUnits place for both digits: 49 each.\n\nSo, 4 appears 188 times, 8 appears 98 times.\n\nDifference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when counting the hundreds place for 4, I had 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times.\n\nYes, that's correct because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89.\n\nSo, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8, in the hundreds place, it's zero.\n\nSo, 188 vs 98, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think about the units place for 4: 49 times. So, from 4,14,24,...,484. That's correct because 484 is the last one before 488.\n\nSimilarly, for 8, units place: 8,18,28,...,488. That's 49 terms as well.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, 188 -98=90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when counting the tens place for 4, I had 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. For 8, I had 4 full blocks and a partial, so 49.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4: 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each 10, so 50.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4 full blocks and a partial, totaling 49.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 4 appears 188 times, 8 appears 98 times, so 188-98=90.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is calculated by considering each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately. Similarly, the number of times the digit 8 appears is calculated. \n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by calculating the number of times 4 appears in each position: units, tens, and hundreds. Similarly, I'll do the same for 8. \n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of ten numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 also appears once. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears once (at page 4) and 8 appears once (at page 8). This pattern repeats every ten pages. \n\nSo, to find out how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48 full groups of ten and a remainder of 8. Each full group contributes one 4 and one 8. So, 48 groups would give 48 fours and 48 eights. Now, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) would have a units digit from 1 to 8. In these, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, in total, for the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, the difference in the units place is 0.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (like 80-89).\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and an additional 88 pages (401-488). \n\nFor each hundred, we have 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds contribute 4*10 = 40 fours and 4*10 = 40 eights. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Let's break this down:\n\n- Pages 401-409: tens digit is 0 (no contribution to fours or eights)\n- Pages 410-419: tens digit is 1 (no contribution)\n- Pages 420-429: tens digit is 2 (no contribution)\n- Pages 430-439: tens digit is 3 (no contribution)\n- Pages 440-449: tens digit is 4 (so 10 fours)\n- Pages 450-459: tens digit is 5 (no contribution)\n- Pages 460-469: tens digit is 6 (no contribution)\n- Pages 470-479: tens digit is 7 (no contribution)\n- Pages 480-488: tens digit is 8 (so 9 eights because we only go up to 488, which is 488, so 480-488 is 9 pages)\n\nSo, in the tens place for the remaining 88 pages, we have 10 fours and 9 eights. \n\nAdding this to the previous total, the tens place gives us 40 + 10 = 50 fours and 40 + 9 = 49 eights. So, the difference in the tens place is 50 - 49 = 1.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. For each hundred, the hundreds digit is the same for all 100 pages. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0. From 100-199, it's 1, from 200-299 it's 2, from 300-399 it's 3, and from 400-488 it's 4.\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Therefore, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nThe digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place, contributing 0 times.\n\nSo, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours and 0 eights, giving a difference of 89 - 0 = 89.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each place:\n\n- Units place: 0\n- Tens place: +1\n- Hundreds place: +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nTotal pages: 488\nNumber of complete decades: 48 (since 48*10=480), with 8 remaining pages (481-488).\nEach complete decade contributes 1 four and 1 eight. So, 48 fours and 48 eights from the decades. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8. So, 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So, 1 four and 1 eight. Thus, units total: 48 +1 =49 fours, 48 +1=49 eights. So, units difference is 0.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40 fours and 4*10=40 eights.\n\nNow, from 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Let's see:\n\n- 400-409: tens digit 0 (no fours or eights)\n- 410-419: tens digit 1 (no)\n- 420-429: tens digit 2 (no)\n- 430-439: tens digit 3 (no)\n- 440-449: tens digit 4 (10 fours)\n- 450-459: tens digit 5 (no)\n- 460-469: tens digit 6 (no)\n- 470-479: tens digit 7 (no)\n- 480-488: tens digit 8 (9 eights because 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, in the tens place, we have 10 fours and 9 eights. So, total fours in tens place: 40 +10=50, eights:40+9=49. So, difference is +1.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 pages. So, 89 fours. Eights in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, hundreds place difference: 89.\n\nTotal difference: units (0) + tens (+1) + hundreds (+89) = 90.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking how many more 4's than 8's, so 90 more fours.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place. Pages 400-488: 488 - 400 +1 =89 pages. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 fours, and 8 in 480-488, which is 9 eights. So, that's correct.\n\nUnits place: 49 fours and 49 eights, so no difference.\n\nSo, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nTotal eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 =90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, total for units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me correct that. When considering the units place, the number of times 4 appears is actually the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any additional in the last partial decade. From 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the floor of 488 divided by 10, which is 48, plus 1 if the last number is 484 or higher. Since 484 is less than 488, we add 1, making it 49 times. So, units place for 4 is 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, etc. Each of these ranges has 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. So, how many such ranges are there in 488 pages?\n\nThe first range is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five ranges. Each contributes 10 times, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check. From 40-49: 10, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. So that's 5 ranges, each giving 10, so 50 times. So, tens place for 4 is 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 times for the digit 4.\n\nNow, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, 400-488 is indeed 89 numbers, so 89 times. So, total for 4's is 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, but I think I might have overcounted. Let me check each part again.\n\nUnits place: From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the last partial group (481-488) which includes 484, so one more. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges * 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of 8's.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, but we need to count how many times 8 appears in the units place. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the last partial group (481-488) which includes 488, so one more. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, except the last one, which has 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers\n\nSo, total for tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9, so 4*10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. From 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. Correct.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 times.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for 4's, I counted 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nFor 8's, in the tens place, I have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five ranges, but the last one has only 9 numbers. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for both digits: 49 each. So, 4's total 188, 8's total 98. Difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I feel like that might be too high. Let me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each digit position separately and count the occurrences.\n\nFor the units digit:\n- For 4: As calculated, 49 times.\n- For 8: 49 times.\n\nFor the tens digit:\n- For 4: 50 times.\n- For 8: 49 times.\n\nFor the hundreds digit:\n- For 4: 89 times.\n- For 8: 0 times.\n\nSo, 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm counting correctly. Sometimes, when counting digit occurrences, it's easy to make off-by-one errors. Let me verify the units place again.\n\nFor units digit 4:\n- The first occurrence is at 4, then 14, 24, ..., 484. So, how many terms? The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, n-1 = (484 - 4)/10 = 480/10 = 48, so n=49. So, 49 times. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for units digit 8:\n- The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, n-1 = (488 - 8)/10 = 480/10 = 48, so n=49. Correct.\n\nFor tens digit 4:\n- As before, 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nFor tens digit 8:\n- 5 ranges, but the last one only goes up to 488, which is 488-480+1=9 numbers. So, 4*10 + 9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds digit for 4: 89, as from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nSo, all counts seem accurate. Therefore, the difference is indeed 90.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: maybe the hundreds digit for 4 is 89, but does that include any overlap? No, because 400-488 is entirely in the hundreds place as 4. So, 89 is correct.\n\nYes, I think I've double-checked all parts, so the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4). Similarly, in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. So, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, we'll take the integer part, which is 48 full groups. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, the last partial group from 481-488 also includes page 484, which is another 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place: Here, the digit 4 appears in a block of ten consecutive numbers. For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all ten numbers. Similarly, this happens in 140-149, 240-249, and 340-349. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see, each hundred has one such block. From 1-99, there's 40-49; from 100-199, 140-149; 200-299, 240-249; 300-399, 340-349; and then from 400-488, 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another block. So, that's five blocks in total? Wait, no, let me count again. From 1-99: 40-49 is one block. 100-199: 140-149 is another. 200-299: 240-249 is another. 300-399: 340-349 is another. 400-488: 440-449 is another. So that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\nWait, but wait, from 400-488, the block 440-449 is entirely within 400-488, so that's fine. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, in every group of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many such groups? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. Then, the last partial group from 481-488 includes page 488, which is another 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in a block of ten consecutive numbers, such as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, from 1-99, 80-89 is one block. 100-199: 180-189 is another. 200-299: 280-289 is another. 300-399: 380-389 is another. Now, 400-488: Does 480-489 fall within 400-488? 480-489 is from 480 to 489, but our book ends at 488, so we only have 480-488. So, how many 8's in the tens place here? From 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but each block of ten would have 10 numbers, but since we're stopping at 488, it's only 9 numbers. So, that's one partial block contributing 9 times. But wait, earlier blocks were full blocks. Let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, so that's 10 times. Similarly, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 each contribute 10 times. Then, 480-488 is 9 times. So, total in the tens place: 4 full blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 from the partial block, so 49 times.\n\nWait, but wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0, so total 98.\n\nWait, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as contributing 9 times, but actually, in the tens place, each number from 480 to 488 has an 8 in the tens digit, so that's 9 times. So, that's correct. So, 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 times, so 4\u00d710=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 in the tens place. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds: 98 total.\n\nWait, but earlier when I counted the 4's, I had 188. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each step again.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\nUnits place: For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. From 1 to 488, how many full tens? 48 full tens (1-480), each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, from 481-488, page 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more, totaling 49.\n\nTens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 times, so 5\u00d710=50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nCounting 8's:\n\nUnits place: Same as 4's, 49 times.\n\nTens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's five blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 4 full blocks \u00d710=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, since 800-899 isn't in the book.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed any 8's in the hundreds place. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can't be 8, so 0 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a formula to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position.\n\nFor the units digit, the number of times a digit d appears is floor(n/10) + (1 if the remainder is >= d else 0), but adjusted for when d is 0. But since we're dealing with digits 4 and 8, which are non-zero, maybe it's simpler.\n\nWait, actually, for units digit, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n is:\n\ncount_units = (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nSimilarly, for tens digit, it's:\n\ncount_tens = (n // 100) * 10 + extra, where extra depends on the remainder.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use a formula for each digit place.\n\nBut maybe I should stick to my initial counting, as it seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for 8's again. From 1 to 488, how many 8's in the units place? For each ten numbers, one 8. So, 488 // 10 = 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, check the last partial ten: 481-488. The units digits here are 1-8, so 8 is included once (488). So, total 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, 8's: Each block of 100 has one block of 10 where the tens digit is 8. So, 1-99: 80-89 is one block, 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189, another 10. 200-299: 280-289, another 10. 300-399: 380-389, another 10. 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds: 98 total.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, plus 484, so 49.\n\nTens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting the hundreds place for 4's, from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, in 440-449, that's 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place for 8's, since the book ends at 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place, so that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try a different approach. Maybe calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately, using a formula.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's = floor(488 / 10) + (1 if (488 % 10) >= 4 else 0) = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in units place: floor(488 / 10) + (1 if (488 % 10) >= 8 else 0) = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nFor the tens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: Let's see, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9. The number of times 4 appears in the tens place is calculated as follows:\n\nThe formula is:\n\ncount = (n // 100) * 10\n\nremainder = n % 100\n\nif remainder >= 40:\n    count += (remainder - 40 + 1)\nelse:\n    count += 0\n\nWait, but actually, it's:\n\nFor each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. The number of times 4 appears in the tens place is 10 times per hundred. But for the last partial hundred, if the tens digit is 4, then the count is from 40 to min(49, n).\n\nWait, maybe a better way is:\n\ncount_tens_4 = (488 // 100) * 10 + max(0, (488 % 100) - 40 + 1)\n\nSo, 488 // 100 = 4 (since 4*100=400), so 4*10=40.\n\n488 % 100 = 88.\n\nSo, 88 - 40 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but that would give 40 + 49 = 89, which can't be right because we know from 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and in the earlier hundreds, 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 times. Wait, but 4 hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40, plus in 400-488, 440-449 is another 10, so total 50. But according to the formula, it's 4*10 + (88-40+1)=40+49=89, which is incorrect. So, maybe the formula isn't correct in this case.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula should be adjusted. Let me think. The number of times the digit 4 appears in the tens place up to 488 is:\n\nFor each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 exactly once for each ten numbers, so 10 times per hundred. So, from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 40 times. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total 40 + 10 = 50 times. So, the formula should be:\n\ncount_tens_4 = (n // 100) * 10 + (if the last partial hundred has tens digit >=4, then add the appropriate number)\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\ncount_tens_4 = (n // 100) * 10\n\nlast_part = n % 100\n\nif last_part >= 40:\n    count_tens_4 += last_part - 40 + 1\nelse:\n    count_tens_4 += 0\n\nSo, for n=488:\n\nlast_part = 88.\n\n88 >=40, so count_tens_4 += 88 -40 +1 = 49.\n\nSo, total count_tens_4 = 4*10 +49=40+49=89.\n\nWait, but that contradicts our earlier count of 50. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, when I count manually, I get 5 blocks of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10 times, so 5\u00d710=50.\n\nBut according to the formula, it's 89, which is way off. So, where's the mistake?\n\nAh, I think the formula is not correctly applied. The formula counts the number of times the digit appears in the tens place up to n, but in our case, n=488, and the formula is counting from 1 to 488, but the way I'm using it might not be correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is meant for a different approach. Let me think again.\n\nThe number of times 4 appears in the tens place from 1 to 488 is:\n\nFor each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so in each hundred, 10 times. So, from 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 40 times. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, total 40 +10=50 times. So, the correct count is 50.\n\nBut the formula gave me 89, which is wrong. So, perhaps the formula is not applicable here, or I'm applying it incorrectly.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the tens place:\n\nUsing the same approach, from 1-400, we have 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times for the tens digit 8 (80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4\u00d710=40 times. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, total 40 +9=49 times, which matches our earlier count.\n\nSo, perhaps the formula works for 8's but not for 4's? That can't be. Wait, no, the formula is the same regardless of the digit. So, maybe I made a mistake in applying it.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\ncount_tens_d = (n // 100) * 10 + max(0, (n % 100) - (d * 10) + 1)\n\nBut only if n % 100 >= d *10, else 0.\n\nSo, for d=4, n=488:\n\ncount_tens_4 = (488 // 100) *10 + max(0, (488 % 100) - (4*10) +1)\n\n= 4*10 + max(0, 88 -40 +1) = 40 + 49=89.\n\nBut that's not correct, as we know it's 50.\n\nWait, so perhaps the formula is not suitable when d is in the higher digits. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is correct, but I'm misapplying it because the last partial hundred includes numbers beyond 488.\n\nWait, when n=488, the last partial hundred is 400-488, so when calculating the tens digit, we can't go beyond 488. So, in the formula, when we calculate (n % 100) - (d*10) +1, we have to ensure that we don't exceed n.\n\nWait, in this case, for d=4, the tens digit starts at 40. So, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 4 occurs from 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 times, not 49.\n\nWait, so perhaps the formula needs to be adjusted for cases where the upper limit is less than the full block.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is correct, but I'm misapplying it because the hundreds digit is 4, and the formula is counting from 1 to 488, which includes the 400-488 range, but in that range, the tens digit 4 only appears from 440-449, which is 10 times, not 49.\n\nSo, perhaps the formula is not applicable here, or I'm misapplying it.\n\nGiven that, maybe it's better to stick with my initial manual counting, which gave me 50 times for 4's in the tens place and 49 times for 8's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, and 8's appear 0 times.\n\nThus, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full groups of 10, contributing 48 times, plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, each contributing 10 times, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488, contributing 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's appear here.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by calculating the number of times the digit 4 appears in each position: units, tens, and hundreds. Similarly, I'll do the same for the digit 8. I remember that in such problems, it's helpful to consider each digit place separately because the number of times a digit appears in each place can be calculated independently.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1 to 10, 4 appears once (at 4); from 11 to 20, it appears once (at 14), and so on. So, to find the total number of times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide the total number of pages by 10 and take the integer part. But since the book ends at 488, I should check if 488 is included. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit cycles up to 8. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of ten are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, does the 48th group end at 480, and then from 481 to 488, there's another 4 in the units place at 484. So, actually, it's 48 full groups plus one more in the incomplete group. So, total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, let me think again. From 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is calculated by considering each position. For the units place, every 10 numbers contribute one 4. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning there are 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490), but since we only go up to 488, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. In this last group, the units digit 4 appears once at 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 (from the full decades) + 1 (from the last partial decade) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of ten numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all ten numbers. So, each such block contributes ten 4's in the tens place. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block contributes ten 4's, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, does the last block end at 449? Yes, because 450-459 would be the next block, but 488 is beyond that. So, 5 blocks, each contributing ten 4's in the tens place, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but let me check. From 1-488, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? It's every time the tens digit is 4, which occurs in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets \u00d710 = 50. So, 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times.\n\nWait, let me confirm: 400 is included, and 488 is included, so the count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the digit 8 appears once every ten numbers in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? As before, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, and then in the last partial decade (481-488), the units digit 8 appears at 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 488 is included, so in the last group, 481-488, the units digit 8 is at 488, which is one occurrence. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** For the tens place, the digit 8 appears in blocks of ten numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, these blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many full blocks are there? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488)\n\nSo, that's four full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing ten 8's, and one partial block (480-488) contributing nine 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4 \u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Each block where the tens digit is 8 contributes ten 8's, except the last one which contributes nine because we stop at 488. So, total is 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds place contributes zero 8's.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the hundreds place: from 1-488, the hundreds digits go from 0 (for 1-99) up to 4 (for 400-488). So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, yes, zero.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 +89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 +49=98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. The blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes ten 8's, so 4\u00d710=40. The last block, 480-488, has nine numbers, each with 8 in the tens place (480,481,...,488). So, that's nine 8's. So, 40 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, we have 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these five blocks contributes ten 4's, so 5\u00d710=50. That's correct.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me think about the units place for 4's. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, and then in the last partial group (481-488), 484 is the only number with a 4 in the units place. So, 48 +1=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, same logic: 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and in the last partial group, 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for 8's, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me recount:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place: 10\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nTotal: 10\u00d74 +9=49. That's correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a big difference. Let me think if there's another way to approach this, maybe by calculating the number of digits in each position and seeing if the counts make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a different method to cross-verify.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers.\n\nFor the units place:\n\n- For any digit d (where d \u22600), the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor(n/10) + (1 if the units digit of n is \u2265d else 0). Wait, actually, it's a bit more precise. The formula is:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in units place = floor(n / 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0) if d \u22600.\n\nWait, but actually, for each digit d from 0 to 9, the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to n is:\n\nIf d = 0: floor(n / 10)\nElse: floor((n + 10 - d) / 10)\n\nWait, maybe that's overcomplicating. Let me think for d=4 and n=488.\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in units place:\n\nNumber of complete decades: floor(488 /10)=48. Each contributes one 4. Then, in the incomplete decade (481-488), check if 488's units digit is >=4. 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so add 1. So, total 48 +1=49. That matches.\n\nSimilarly for d=8:\n\nNumber of times 8 appears in units place:\n\nfloor(488 /10)=48. Then, check if 488 mod10 >=8, which it is (8>=8), so add 1. So, 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in tens place from 1 to n is calculated by:\n\nFor each position (tens), the number is:\n\nLet me think, for the tens place, the formula is:\n\nFor each digit d, the number of times it appears in the tens place is:\n\nfloor((n - d*10 +10)/100)*10 + max(0, min(n - d*10 +1, n +1) - (d*10 +1) +1 )\n\nWait, that might be too complicated. Alternatively, for each digit d, the number of times it appears in the tens place is:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds *10 + extra in the incomplete hundred.\n\nFor example, for d=4 in the tens place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nIt appears in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n\nEach of these ranges contributes 10 times, except possibly the last one if n is less than the end of the range.\n\nIn this case, 440-449 is entirely within 488, so each of the five ranges contributes 10, so 5\u00d710=50.\n\nSimilarly for d=8 in the tens place:\n\nRanges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n\nEach of the first four ranges contributes 10, and the last one contributes 9, so 4\u00d710 +9=49.\n\nThat matches our earlier calculation.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in hundreds place from 1 to n:\n\nIf d=0, it's a bit different, but for d=4 and d=8:\n\nFor d=4:\n\nNumbers from 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. So, 488 -400 +1=89.\n\nFor d=8:\n\nNumbers from 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but since n=488 <800, there are zero occurrences.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\nFor 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nFor 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. When counting the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. But wait, 400 is the first number with a 4 in the hundreds place, and 488 is the last. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 400 is included, so the count is 488 -400 +1=89. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers, all within 488, so that's fine.\n\nWait, but let me check if 480-488 affects the 4's count in the tens place. No, because we're only counting 4's in the tens place, which would be from 40-49, etc., and 480-488 is for 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, no, 480-488 is for 8's in the tens place, but 440-449 is for 4's in the tens place.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me recount. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 -400 +1=89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think: 400 is the first, 401, 402,...,488. So, 89 numbers. Yes.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can write a small table for a smaller number and see if the method works.\n\nFor example, let's say we have a 20-page book. How many 4's and 8's?\n\nPage numbers 1-20.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\nUnits place: 4,14 \u2192 2 times.\n\nTens place: 40-49, but since we only go up to 20, no tens place 4's.\n\nHundreds place: none.\n\nTotal 4's:2.\n\nCounting 8's:\n\nUnits place:8,18 \u21922 times.\n\nTens place:80-89, but up to 20, so none.\n\nHundreds place: none.\n\nTotal 8's:2.\n\nDifference:2-2=0.\n\nWait, but according to my method:\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place: floor(20/10)=2, and since 20 mod10=0 <4, so 2.\n\nTens place: floor((20 -40)/100)= negative, so 0.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal 4's:2.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: floor(20/10)=2, and since 20 mod10=0 <8, so 2.\n\nTens place:0.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal 8's:2.\n\nDifference:0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: 50-page book.\n\n4's:\n\nUnits: floor(50/10)=5, and 50 mod10=0 <4, so 5.\n\nTens: 40-49 \u219210 numbers, so 10.\n\nHundreds:0.\n\nTotal 4's:5+10=15.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits: floor(50/10)=5, 50 mod10=0 <8, so 5.\n\nTens:80-89, but up to 50, so none.\n\nHundreds:0.\n\nTotal 8's:5.\n\nDifference:15-5=10.\n\nWait, let's count manually:\n\n4's: in units place:4,14,24,34,44 \u21925 times.\n\nIn tens place:40-49 \u219210 times.\n\nTotal:15.\n\n8's: in units place:8,18,28,38,48 \u21925 times.\n\nTens place: none.\n\nTotal:5.\n\nDifference:10. Correct.\n\nSo, my method works for smaller numbers, so likely correct for 488.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit's occurrence in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full groups of ten (48 \u00d7 1) + 1 in the last partial group = 49.\n- **Tens place:** Five blocks (40-49, 140-149, etc.) \u00d7 10 = 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full groups + 1 in the last partial group = 49.\n- **Tens place:** Four full blocks (80-89, etc.) \u00d7 10 + 9 in the last partial block = 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by thinking about how to count the number of times a digit appears in each position. Each digit in a number can be in the units place, tens place, or hundreds place. So, I should probably count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each of these positions separately and then add them up.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of ten numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in the range 1-10, 4 appears once (at 4), and 8 appears once (at 8). Similarly, in 11-20, 4 appears once (at 14), and 8 appears once (at 18), and so on. This pattern continues for each set of ten numbers. So, to find the total number of times a digit appears in the units place, I can divide the total number of pages by 10 and see how many complete groups of ten there are, then multiply by 1 (since each group contributes one occurrence of the digit). But wait, I also need to check if the last group has any remaining numbers beyond a multiple of ten, and if so, whether the digit appears in that remaining part.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place: Here, each digit appears in the tens place for a block of 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89). This pattern repeats every 100 numbers. So, the number of times a digit appears in the tens place is determined by how many complete hundreds are in the total number of pages, multiplied by 10, plus any additional occurrences in the partial hundred if the total isn't a multiple of 100.\n\nFor the hundreds place: This is only relevant for three-digit page numbers. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. Let me count how many pages that is: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8.\n\nWait, but the hundreds place is only for numbers from 100 onwards, right? So, pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit, so we don't count any digits there for the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me structure this systematically. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nTotal number of pages: 488.\n\nNumber of complete groups of ten: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of ten, and an additional 8 pages (481-488).\n\nIn each complete group of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does 8. So, for the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: 48 groups \u00d7 1 = 48, plus any additional 4's in the last partial group (481-488). Let's see, in 481-488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, there's one more 4 in 484. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in units place: 48 \u00d7 1 = 48, plus any additional 8's in the last partial group. The last group is 481-488, so the units digits go up to 8. So, 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more 8. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, both 4's and 8's have 49 occurrences in the units place. Hmm, but I need to check if that's correct. Let me think again: For each group of ten, from 0-9, 10-19, etc., each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, for 488 pages, which is 48 full tens and 8 extra pages. So, in each full ten, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, 48 \u00d7 1 = 48 for each. Then, in the last 8 pages, 481-488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total 4's: 48 +1=49, and 8's: 48 +1=49. So, they are equal in the units place. So, the difference so far is 0.\n\nNext, the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, for example, in 0-99, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (40-49), and similarly for 8 (80-89). Then, this pattern repeats every 100 numbers.\n\nSo, total number of hundreds in 488 pages: 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds, and a partial hundred of 88 pages (400-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and so does 8. So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 for each digit.\n\nNow, in the partial hundred (400-488), how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nFrom 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Let's break it down:\n\n- 400-409: tens digit is 0\n- 410-419: tens digit is 1\n- 420-429: tens digit is 2\n- 430-439: tens digit is 3\n- 440-449: tens digit is 4\n- 450-459: tens digit is 5\n- 460-469: tens digit is 6\n- 470-479: tens digit is 7\n- 480-488: tens digit is 8\n\nSo, in the partial hundred, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4. Similarly, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from partial hundred) = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from partial hundred) = 49.\n\nSo, the difference in the tens place is 50 (4's) - 49 (8's) = +1.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nAs I thought earlier, the hundreds digit is only present in page numbers from 100 onwards. So, for pages 1-99, there's no hundreds digit, so no 4's or 8's there.\n\nFor pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFor pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFor pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFor pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAs for the digit 8, does it appear in the hundreds place? Since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nDifference in hundreds place: 89 - 0 = +89.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each place:\n\n- Units place: 49 - 49 = 0\n- Tens place: 50 - 49 = +1\n- Hundreds place: 89 - 0 = +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, so that means there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n488 pages. Each group of 10 has one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, total 4's: 48 +1=49, 8's:48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach complete hundred (100 pages) has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 4\u00d710=40 each. Then, the partial hundred from 401-488: tens digits go from 0-8. For 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 +10=50 for 4's, and 40 +9=49 for 8's. So, the difference is +1.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, which is 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 89 -0=89.\n\nAdding up: 0 +1 +89=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 pages. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nIs there any other place where 4 or 8 could appear? I don't think so. We've covered units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nSo, total number of 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal number of 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each group of ten pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete groups of ten, contributing 48 each.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - Total 4's: 49, Total 8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each complete hundred contributes ten 4's and ten 8's.\n   - There are 4 complete hundreds, contributing 40 each.\n   - The partial hundred (400-488) adds ten 4's (440-449) and nine 8's (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 50, Total 8's: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n   - No 8's appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89, Total 8's: 0.\n\nSumming up:\n- Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n- Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I'll calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each complete block, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place, so that's 48 times each. Now, in the incomplete block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So, adding that to the previous total, units place gives us 48 + 1 = 49 times for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 times for 8. Wait, that can't be right because the total should be the same for both, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. From 1 to 488, each block of 10 contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 blocks give 48 each, and then in the last 8 numbers, 481-488, units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once, and 8 appears once. So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8. So, units place contributes equally to both, so no difference there.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, 4 and 8 can appear in the tens position. Each occurrence of 4 or 8 in the tens place affects a block of 100 numbers. For example, in the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, etc. Similarly for 8, it's 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, etc. So, for each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49) and 8 for 10 numbers (80-89). Now, since our book goes up to 488, let's see how many complete hundreds we have. The page numbers go up to 488, so that's 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49 in each hundred) and 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So, that's 4 hundreds * 10 = 40 times for 4 and 40 times for 8 in the tens place. Now, in the incomplete hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 440-449, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in 480-489, but our book stops at 488, so that's 9 times (480-488). Wait, no, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers. Wait, no, 480 is included, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. Wait, actually, 480 is the first, then 481, up to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred. So, adding up, for 4 in the tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. For 8 in the tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. That means 4 appears one more time in the tens place than 8.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's 89 times because each page from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. The hundreds digits are 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's tally up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal for 8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's), which equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, the last 8 numbers (481-488) have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, units: 48 + 1 = 49 for both. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, four complete hundreds give 4*10=40 for 4 and 40 for 8. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 times. The tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page. So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0. Correct.\n\nAdding up: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 for 4's. 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 for 8's. Difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 48 complete blocks (1-480) give 48 each.\n   - The last 8 numbers (481-488) contribute one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total: 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - 4 complete hundreds (1-400) give 40 each.\n   - The last partial hundred (401-488) has 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 for 4 and 49 for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 for 4 and 0 for 8.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's in each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. Similarly, I'll count the number of 8's in each place and then compare.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once every ten numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does that affect the count? Let me think.\n\nFirst, let's handle the units place for 4's. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, there's one 4. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets of 10, and then an extra 8 numbers. In each set of 10, there's one 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set from 481 to 488, does 484 count? Yes, because 484 is within 481-488. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times? Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so the last full set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, actually, from 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of 10. Each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers, we have 484 as the only number with a 4 in the units place. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times for 4's in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 1 to 480, it's 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of 10, so 48 4's in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, that's 8 numbers: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Among these, only 484 has a 4 in the units place. So, that's 1 more, making it 49. Okay, so 49 4's in the units place.\n\nNow, for the units place for 8's. Similarly, every 10 numbers, there's one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial set from 481 to 488, the numbers are 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Here, 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more, making it 48 + 1 = 49 times for 8's in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does that mean we have 488 as the last number? Yes, so 488 is included. Therefore, 49 8's in the units place.\n\nWait, but hold on, I thought from 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers, only 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, total 48 + 1 = 49. So, both 4's and 8's have 49 occurrences in the units place. So, in the units place, they are equal. Therefore, the difference comes from the tens and hundreds places.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. Let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. For example, in the range 40-49, each number has a 4 in the tens place, so that's 10 times. Similarly, in the range 140-149, another 10 times, and so on.\n\nSo, let's calculate the number of times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens place is the second digit from the right. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place exactly 10 times: 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n\nNow, since the book has 488 pages, let's see how many hundreds we have. From 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, up to 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Wait, no, 488 - 400 is 88, so plus 1 is 89. But for the tens place, we can consider each hundred separately.\n\nFrom 1-99: The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nFrom 100-199: The tens digit is 4 in 140-149, another 10 times.\n\nFrom 200-299: Similarly, 240-249, another 10 times.\n\nFrom 300-399: 340-349, another 10 times.\n\nFrom 400-488: Now, this is where it might be different because 488 is less than 500. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 times.\n\nWait, but 488 is beyond 449, so 440-449 is fully included. So, that's 10 times.\n\nSo, total number of times 4 appears in the tens place is 10 (from 1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 50 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: From 1-99, 40-49: 10 times.\n\n100-199: 140-149: 10 times.\n\n200-299: 240-249: 10 times.\n\n300-399: 340-349: 10 times.\n\n400-488: 440-449: 10 times.\n\nSo, that's 5 sets of 10, so 50 times.\n\nNow, for the 8's in the tens place. Let's do the same.\n\nFrom 1-99: The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nFrom 100-199: The tens digit is 8 in 180-189, another 10 times.\n\nFrom 200-299: 280-289, another 10 times.\n\nFrom 300-399: 380-389, another 10 times.\n\nFrom 400-488: Now, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489. But wait, our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here, not 10.\n\nWait, because 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place for 400-488, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total number of times 8 appears in the tens place is 10 (from 1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 49 times.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\n1-99: 80-89: 10\n\n100-199: 180-189: 10\n\n200-299: 280-289: 10\n\n300-399: 380-389: 10\n\n400-488: 480-488: 9\n\nTotal: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nSo, 49 times for 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. Let's count how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nThe hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times.\n\nFor 8's in the hundreds place, we need to see if any page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, the count for 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nNow, let's summarize:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n\n- Tens place: 50 times\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n\n- Tens place: 49 times\n\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49\n\nTens place: 50\n\nHundreds place: 89\n\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49\n\nTens place: 49\n\nHundreds place: 0\n\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, but I'm a bit unsure because I might have overcounted somewhere. Let me check each place again.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place: From 1-488, every 10 numbers, one 4 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial set, from 481-488, we have 484, which is one more. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, 10 times. There are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, 5 sets of 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: Similarly, 48 full sets, 48, plus 488, which is one more, so 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: From 1-99: 10\n\n100-199:10\n\n200-299:10\n\n300-399:10\n\n400-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers)\n\nTotal: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm thinking, does 488 count as having an 8 in the hundreds place? No, because 488 is in the hundreds place as 4, and the tens as 8, units as 8. So, hundreds place is 4, so 8 doesn't appear there. So, correct, 0.\n\nSo, the difference is 90. Therefore, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 49 in total. Correct.\n\nYes, I think the calculation is correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll need to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, there are 48 full blocks and then 8 more numbers (481 to 488). Each full block contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial block from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is within this range, adding one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for every block of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1 to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), or 4 (400-488). \n\nFor each hundred block (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.), the tens digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. How many full hundreds are there? From 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So that's five blocks, but the last one isn't a full hundred. Wait, no, actually, from 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So that's four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488, which is 88 pages. Wait, maybe I should think differently. Each hundred block has 100 numbers, so from 1-100, 101-200, etc., up to 400-499. But since our book ends at 488, the last block is only up to 488.\n\nSo, for the tens place, each hundred block contributes 10 4's. So, how many full hundred blocks are there? Let's see: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. That's four full hundred blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the last block is 401-488. How many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? The tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on. Wait, actually, in the 400s, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, the 400s would have 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4: 440-449. But wait, our book ends at 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, right? Because 449 is less than 488. So, that's another 10 4's in the tens place. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the tens digit cycles 0-9 for each hundred, but in 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, 400-488 is 89 pages, so the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, but in the 400s, the tens digit can go up to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, in the 400s, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but since 488 is beyond 449, all those 10 numbers are included. So, in the 400s, we have another 10 4's in the tens place. Therefore, total 4's in the tens place would be 4 (from the first four hundreds) * 10 = 40, plus 10 from the 400s, totaling 50.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. For each hundred block (like 1-100), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49). So, for 1-100, 10 times. For 101-200, another 10 times (140-149). Similarly, 201-300: 240-249, 10 times. 301-400: 340-349, 10 times. That's four blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. Now, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, but since 488 is beyond 449, those 10 are included. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 pages, so does the tens digit go beyond 4? No, because 488 is the last page. So, 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, 10 more. So, total 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, in 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all those numbers. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but wait, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the hundreds place, so each of those 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, total 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me add up all the 4's: units place 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. So, total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll need to count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial block from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is included, which adds one more 8. So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: For every block of 100 numbers, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many such blocks are there? From 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, each hundred block contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except maybe the last one if it's not a full hundred.\n\nSo, let's see: 1-100: 10 times (80-89). 101-200: 10 times (180-189). 201-300: 10 times (280-289). 301-400: 10 times (380-389). Now, 401-488: The tens digit is 8 in 480-488, but wait, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 9 times in 480-488. So, in the 400s, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: 4 blocks (1-400) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, yes, 9 times. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the numbers 800-899. But our book ends at 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. So, total 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 48 full blocks (each 10 pages) + 1 in the last partial block = 49.\n- Tens place: 4 full hundreds (each contributing 10) + 10 in the 400s (440-449) = 50.\n- Hundreds place: 89 (400-488).\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 48 full blocks + 1 in the last partial block = 49.\n- Tens place: 4 full hundreds (each contributing 10) + 9 in the 400s (480-488) = 49.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each position and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and an extra 8 numbers (481 to 488). In each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the digit 8 appears once (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1, which is 48, plus any extra 4's in the incomplete group. Looking at the incomplete group from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once in this group (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. That means there's no difference in the units place.\n\nMoving on to the tens place:\n\nFor the tens digit, the digits cycle every 100 numbers. Each group of 100 has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 4 (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.) and similarly 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 8 (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, how many complete groups of 100 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete groups (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and an incomplete group from 401-488. In each complete group, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 10 times. So, for 4 complete groups, that's 4 * 10 = 40 for 4's and 4 * 10 = 40 for 8's. Now, the incomplete group from 401-488: the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 440-449, that's 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-489, but since our book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in this incomplete group. Therefore, the total for the tens place: 4's are 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's are 40 + 9 = 49. So, in the tens place, there are 50 4's and 49 8's. That means there's 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place:\n\nThe hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's see when 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's from 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. What about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit can't be 8 because the book only goes up to 488. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. Therefore, the count for 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit position:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's are printed than 8's, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. \n\nStarting with the units place: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing 1 to 4 and 1 to 8, so 48 each. The last 8 numbers (481-488) have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488), so units total 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's, so 40 each. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), 440-449 gives 10 4's, and 480-488 gives 9 8's. So, 40 +10=50 for 4's, and 40 +9=49 for 8's. That looks right.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's. No 8's in the hundreds place, correct.\n\nAdding them up: 49+50+89=188 for 4's, and 49+49+0=98 for 8's. The difference is 188-98=90. \n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nAnother way to check: For each digit position, I considered how many times 4 and 8 appear. I think I accounted for all positions correctly. So, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in all page numbers is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such groups are there from 1 to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, that would give us 48 occurrences. However, the last group might not be complete. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48 full groups (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490), but since the book ends at 488, the last group is 481-490, but we only go up to 488. So, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, meaning the 48th group does have a 4 in the units place. So, 48 occurrences in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for every group of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. How many such groups are there? From 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, that's five groups. Wait, no, actually, from 1-99, the tens place for 4 is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. Then 400-488: Here, the tens place is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, total 5 groups, each contributing 10 occurrences, so 5\u00d710=50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, 89 occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: Same as before, for every group of 10, the digit 8 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many full groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups. Each group contributes one 8 in the units place, so 48 occurrences. However, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's correct, 48 occurrences.\n\nNext, the tens place: For every group of 100, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place, like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last group is 480-488. So, how many such groups are there? Let's see:\n\nFrom 1-99: 80-89, that's 10 occurrences.\n\nFrom 100-199: 180-189, another 10.\n\nFrom 200-299: 280-289, another 10.\n\nFrom 300-399: 380-389, another 10.\n\nFrom 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but the book stops at 488, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 for all these, so 9 occurrences instead of 10.\n\nSo, total in the tens place: 10 (from 1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 49 occurrences.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only for numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. For the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. So, 480 is included, right? So, 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. So, yes, 49 in total.\n\nNow, so total 4's are 187, and total 8's are 97. The difference is 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's and 8's.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 times. Because from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48.\n\n- Tens place: For each hundred, 10 times. From 1-99: 10 (40-49). 100-199: 10 (140-149). 200-299: 10 (240-249). 300-399: 10 (340-349). 400-488: 10 (440-449). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, 5\u00d710=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 48+50+89=187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 times, same as 4's, because every 10 numbers contribute one 8 in the units place. 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full groups, and the last group ends at 488, which includes 488, so 48.\n\n- Tens place: From 1-99: 10 (80-89). 100-199: 10 (180-189). 200-299: 10 (280-289). 300-399: 10 (380-389). 400-488: 9 (480-488). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, since 800 is beyond 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 48+49=97.\n\nSo, difference is 187-97=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the tens place for 8's? Let's see: 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Then 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Then 480-488: that's 9 numbers, as 480,481,...,488. So, 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. 488-400+1=89. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nYes, so 187-97=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 187 - 97 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many groups of 10 are there from 1 to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups and a partial group from 481 to 488. Each full group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the partial group from 481-488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so the 4 appears once more. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for every 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. How many such hundreds are there in 488? Let's see: 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred from 401-488. Each full hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the 4 appears in the tens place for 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: Units place (49) + Tens place (50) + Hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many full groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. So, 48 times. Then, in the partial group from 481-488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once. So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For every 100 numbers, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last group is 480-488. So, how many full hundreds? 4 full hundreds as before. Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 8's. Wait, but actually, the tens place is 8 for all numbers from 480 to 489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800 and 899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: Units place (49) + Tens place (49) + Hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. For the tens place, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, 4 full hundreds give 4*10=40, plus 9, totaling 49. So, yes, 49 8's in the tens place. Units place is 49, so total 49 + 49 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers contribute one 4. So, 48 full groups (1-480) give 48 4's. Then, 481-488: 484 has a 4 in the units place. So, total 49.\n\n- Tens place: From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, total 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full groups (1-480) give 48 8's. Then, 481-488: 488 has an 8 in the units place, so one more. Total 49.\n\n- Tens place: From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, 9 more. Total 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for the 8's. Let me check again. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so 9 8's in the tens place. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: For the tens place, the number of times 8 appears is the same as the number of times 4 appears in the tens place, but only up to 488. Wait, no, because 4 appears in the hundreds place as well, but 8 doesn't.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I can list out the counts again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: For each 10 numbers, one 4. From 1 to 488, that's 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490), but since we stop at 488, the last decade is 481-490, but we only go up to 488. So, in 481-488, the units digit 4 occurs once (484). So, total units 4's: 48 (from 1-480) + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, from 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. Total 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: Similarly, each 10 numbers contribute one 8. From 1-480, that's 48 8's. Then, in 481-488, the units digit 8 occurs once (488). So, total 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 more. Total 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I feel like 90 is a big difference. Let me check with a smaller example to see if my method is correct.\n\nSuppose the book has 20 pages. How many 4's and 8's would there be?\n\nPage numbers: 1-20.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\n- Units place: 4,14 \u2192 2 times.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49, but we only go up to 20, so none.\n\n- Hundreds place: none.\n\nTotal 4's: 2.\n\nCounting 8's:\n\n- Units place: 8,18 \u2192 2 times.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89, but we only go up to 20, so none.\n\n- Hundreds place: none.\n\nTotal 8's: 2.\n\nDifference: 2 - 2 = 0.\n\nWait, but according to my method, for 20 pages:\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits: 20 /10 = 2, so 2.\n\nTens: 20 /100 = 0, so 0.\n\nHundreds: 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 2.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits: 20 /10 = 2.\n\nTens: 0.\n\nHundreds: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 2.\n\nDifference: 0.\n\nWhich is correct because in 1-20, 4 appears twice (4,14) and 8 appears twice (8,18).\n\nAnother example: 48 pages.\n\n4's:\n\nUnits: 4,14,24,34,44 \u2192 5 times.\n\nTens: 40-49, but we only go up to 48, so 40-48: 9 numbers, but only the tens digit is 4, so 9 times.\n\nWait, no, in the tens place, each 100 contributes 10 times, but in 1-48, it's only 40-48, which is 9 numbers, so 9 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but according to my method:\n\nUnits: 48 /10 = 4.8 \u2192 4 full groups, each contributing 1, so 4. Then, in 41-48, units digit 4 occurs once (44). So, total units 4's: 4 +1=5.\n\nTens: 48 /100 = 0.48 \u2192 0 full hundreds, but in the tens place, from 40-48, that's 9 numbers, so 9 4's in the tens place.\n\nHundreds: 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 5 +9=14.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits: 48 /10=4.8 \u2192 4 full groups, each contributing 1, so 4. Then, in 41-48, units digit 8 occurs once (48). So, total units 8's:4 +1=5.\n\nTens: 48 /100=0.48 \u2192 0 full hundreds, but in the tens place, from 40-48, the tens digit is 4, not 8, so no 8's in the tens place.\n\nHundreds: 0.\n\nTotal 8's:5.\n\nDifference:14 -5=9.\n\nWait, let's count manually:\n\nNumbers with 4:\n\nUnits:4,14,24,34,44 \u21925.\n\nTens:40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48 \u21929.\n\nTotal 4's:14.\n\nNumbers with 8:\n\nUnits:8,18,28,38,48 \u21925.\n\nTens: none.\n\nTotal 8's:5.\n\nDifference:14-5=9. So, my method works for 48 pages.\n\nSo, applying the same method to 488 pages, I get 188 4's and 98 8's, difference 90. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe using a formula.\n\nThe total number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n can be calculated using a formula that considers each digit position separately.\n\nFor a given digit position (units, tens, hundreds), we can calculate the number of times d appears.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nThe number of times d appears is floor(n/10) + (if the units digit of n is >= d, add 1 else 0).\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\nIt's floor(n/100) * 10 + (if the tens digit of n is > d, add (d+1 - (tens digit of n)), else if tens digit of n == d, add (units digit of n +1), else 0).\n\nWait, maybe it's better to use the standard digit counting method.\n\nFor each digit position, we can calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in units place from 1 to 488.\n\nWe can use the formula:\n\ncount = (n // 10) * 1 + (1 if (n % 10) >= 4 else 0)\n\nWait, no, more accurately, for units digit:\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is:\n\ncount = (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nBut since d is 4, it's:\n\ncount = (488 // 10) + (1 if (488 % 10) >=4 else 0)\n\n488 //10 =48, 488%10=8 >=4, so 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in tens place.\n\nThe formula is:\n\nhigher = n // 100\n\ncurrent = (n //10) %10\n\nlower = n %10\n\nif current >4: count = (higher +1) *10\n\nelif current ==4: count = higher *10 + (lower +1)\n\nelse: count = higher *10\n\nSo, for 488:\n\nhigher =488 //100=4\n\ncurrent = (488//10)%10=8%10=8\n\nlower=488%10=8\n\nSince current (8) >4, count=(4+1)*10=5*10=50.\n\nWait, but in reality, from 1-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. So, each hundred contributes 10, and in the last partial hundred, 440-449 is fully included, so 10 more. So, total 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in hundreds place.\n\nIt's the same as the number of numbers from 400 to 488, which is 488 -400 +1=89.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly for 8's:\n\nUnits place:\n\ncount = (488//10) + (1 if (488%10)>=8 else 0)=48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nhigher=4\n\ncurrent=(488//10)%10=8\n\nlower=8\n\nSince current (8) >8? No, current=8, which is equal to d=8.\n\nSo, count=higher*10 + (lower +1)=4*10 + (8+1)=40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of times 8 appears in hundreds place is 0, since 488 <800.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll need to check each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, the digit 4 appears once (at page 4). From 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. So, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of ten and then an extra 8 pages. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times, plus any additional times in the last partial group. But wait, in the last group, which is pages 481-488, the units digit cycles from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear in the units place here? Yes, at page 484. So that's one more 4. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten numbers. For example, from 40-49, each of those ten pages has a 4 in the tens place. Similarly, this happens in each hundred block. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages in the 400s (401-488). \n\nIn each hundred block, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 pages. So, for the first four hundreds, that's 4 times 10, which is 40. Now, in the 400s, the tens digit can be 4 as well. Wait, no. The 400s are pages 400-488. The tens digit is 0 for 400-409, 1 for 410-419, up to 8 for 480-488. So, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 only once, from 440-449. That's another 10 pages. So, adding that to the previous 40, we get 40 + 10 = 50. So, the tens place contributes 50 4's.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all pages from 400-488. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 pages has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed are 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll use the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4's, in every group of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many complete groups of ten are there? 48 complete groups (since 488 / 10 = 48.8). Each group contributes one 8 in the units place, so that's 48. Plus, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so that's one more 8 at page 488. So, units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see: in each hundred, there's one block where the tens digit is 8. So, in 1-100, it's 80-89; 101-200, it's 180-189; 201-300, 280-289; 301-400, 380-389; and then in 401-488, it's 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So, how many complete blocks of ten with 8 in the tens place are there?\n\nFrom 1-400, there are four blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes 10 8's, so that's 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the block would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8 in this book. Therefore, there are 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed are 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 groups of ten, each contributing 1, so 48, plus 1 in the last group, total 49.\n- Tens: 4 hundreds blocks (1-100, etc.), each contributing 10, so 40, plus in the 400s, 440-449, which is another 10, so 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 groups of ten, each contributing 1, so 48, plus 1 in the last group, total 49.\n- Tens: 4 blocks of ten in each hundred (80-89, etc.), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus in the 400s, 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9. Total tens place 8's: 49.\n- Hundreds: 0, as before.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units Place:** \n   - Every 10 pages contribute 1 occurrence of 4.\n   - Total groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - In the last partial group (481-488), 484 adds 1 more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:** \n   - Each block of 100 pages has 10 occurrences (e.g., 40-49).\n   - For the first 400 pages: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - In the 400s (401-488), 440-449 adds another 10.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:** \n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total pages: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units Place:** \n   - Every 10 pages contribute 1 occurrence of 8.\n   - Total groups of 10: 48, contributing 48.\n   - In the last partial group (481-488), 488 adds 1 more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:** \n   - Each block of 100 pages has 10 occurrences (e.g., 80-89).\n   - For the first 400 pages: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - In the 400s, 480-488 adds 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:** \n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I think this will make it easier to count without missing any numbers.\n\nFirst, I'll count the number of times 4 appears in each position.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (at page 4). From 11-20, 4 appears once (at page 14), and so on. Since the book has 488 pages, the number of complete groups of ten is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8). So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times. But wait, I think I need to check if there's a partial group beyond the 48th group. The last group would be 481-490, but since the book only goes up to 488, the units digit 4 would appear once more at 484. So, total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nWait, no, actually, each group of ten contributes one 4 in the units place. So from 1 to 488, the number of tens is 48 full tens (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490, but wait, 488 is less than 490, so actually, up to 480, which is 48 groups of ten. So, each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is 488, so the last group is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the units digit 4 would appear at 484, which is within 481-488. So, that's one more. So total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 1-10, 4 appears once; 11-20, once; ... up to 481-490, which is the 49th group, but since we only go up to 488, does that affect the count? Hmm, perhaps not, because 488 is within the 481-490 group, so 484 is included, so yes, 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of ten and an additional 8 numbers (481-488). So in each full group, 4 appears once in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the partial group 481-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, only at 484, so one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place in groups where the tens digit is 4. So, for example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. However, since the book ends at 488, the last group 440-449 is fully included, but 480-489 would be another group, but since we only go up to 488, we need to check how many times 4 appears in the tens place beyond 440-449.\n\nWait, no, actually, let's list them:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place.\n- 140-149: 10 numbers.\n- 240-249: 10 numbers.\n- 340-349: 10 numbers.\n- 440-449: 10 numbers.\n\nBut wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. Now, after 449, the next occurrence of 4 in the tens place would be 540-549, but since the book only goes up to 488, that's beyond, so we don't include that.\n\nSo, how many such groups are there? Let's see: starting from 40-49, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 groups, each contributing 10 occurrences, so 5 * 10 = 50 times.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check: 40-49 is the first group, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 groups, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400 is the first page with 4 in the hundreds place, and 488 is the last. So, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the occurrences of 4:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: similar to 4, in each group of ten, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-10, 8 appears once (at 8). From 11-20, once (at 18), and so on. Since there are 48 full groups of ten (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490), but since the book ends at 488, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in each full group of ten, 8 appears once, so 48 times. Now, in the partial group 481-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's list the numbers: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, 8 appears once at 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: the digit 8 appears in the tens place in groups like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Each of these groups contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. Now, since the book ends at 488, the group 480-489 is only partially included, up to 488. So, let's count:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 488 - 480 + 1 = 9)\n\nWait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488: that's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, each group contributes 10, except the last one, which contributes 9 because the book ends at 488. So, total tens place 8's: 4 groups of 10 and one group of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. The groups are:\n\n1. 80-89: 10\n2. 180-189: 10\n3. 280-289: 10\n4. 380-389: 10\n5. 480-488: 9 (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers)\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: the digit 8 appears in the hundreds place in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, the hundreds place contributes 0 times.\n\nSo, total 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me add that: 49 + 49 is 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's are 188, total 8's are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. I had 5 groups, each contributing 10, so 50. Let me list them:\n\n- 40-49: 10\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249: 10\n- 340-349: 10\n- 440-449: 10\nThat's 5 groups, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place:\n\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9\nTotal: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 49, correct.\n\nUnits place for 8's: 49, correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 89, correct.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the hundreds place, since the book ends at 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - For every group of ten numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20), the digit 4 appears once in the units place.  \n   - There are 48 full groups of ten (1-480) and an additional 8 numbers (481-488).  \n   - In the units place, 4 appears 48 times in the full groups and once in the partial group (484).  \n   - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place in groups like 40-49, 140-149, etc.  \n   - There are 5 such groups (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 occurrences.  \n   - Total in tens place: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488.  \n   - This is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 occurrences.  \n   - Total in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total occurrences of 4:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Similar to 4, 8 appears once in the units place for every group of ten.  \n   - There are 48 full groups and an additional 8 numbers (481-488).  \n   - In the units place, 8 appears 48 times in the full groups and once in the partial group (488).  \n   - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place in groups like 80-89, 180-189, etc.  \n   - There are 5 such groups, but the last group (480-488) only has 9 numbers.  \n   - Total in tens place: 4 \u00d7 10 (for the first four groups) + 9 (for 480-488) = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Total in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total occurrences of 8:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe digit 4 is printed 90 more times than the digit 8.  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of times the digit 4 appears. I'll consider each position in the page numbers: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nFirst, for the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, in each of the 48 full sets, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, giving 48 times. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once here as well (page 484). So, total for the units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nNext, for the tens place: Similarly, the digit 4 appears in the tens place in every block of 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, each number has a 4 in the tens place. There are 10 such numbers in each block. Now, how many blocks of 100 are there in 488? There are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then the last block from 401-488. In each of the first four blocks, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49 in the first block). So that's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last block (401-488), the tens digit can be 0-8. So, the numbers where the tens digit is 4 are 440-449. That's 10 numbers again. But wait, 440-449 would be in the 400-499 range, but our book only goes up to 488. So, from 440-449, all 10 numbers are within 488, right? Wait, 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 are included. So, that's another 10 times. So, total for the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. Let's see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but our book stops at 488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? Let's calculate: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up all the places for the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal number of 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high, but let's proceed.\n\nNow, let's count the number of times the digit 8 appears. Again, we'll check each place: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, in every block of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full blocks of ten are there? As before, 48 full blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each of the 48 blocks, the digit 8 appears once in the units place, giving 48 times. In the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the digit 8 appears once here as well (page 488). So, total for units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in every block of 100 numbers. Specifically, in the range x80 to x89, where x is the hundreds digit. So, in each block of 100, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks do we have? From 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, the first four blocks each have 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last block (401-488), the tens digit can be 0-8. The numbers where the tens digit is 8 are 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. Therefore, total for the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 times.\n\nAdding up all the places for the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal number of 8's: 49 + 49 = 98 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units: 49, Tens: 49, so 98 total. That seems correct.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't overcount somewhere.\n\nWait, when counting the hundreds place for 4's, I considered 400-488 as 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nFor the tens place of 4's, I had 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 times, so 40, plus the 440-449 block, which is 10, making 50. That seems right.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the 484 in the last partial block, making 49. That's correct.\n\nFor the 8's, units place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, plus the 488, so 49. Tens place: 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10, so 40, plus in the last block, 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9, making 49. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 4's: 188, 8's: 98, difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in higher places, it's easy to make an off-by-one error. Let me verify the counts again.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n\n- Units place: From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 times. That's correct.\n\n- Tens place: For the tens digit being 4. It occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers. Now, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Wait, but earlier I thought there were 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10, and then the 440-449 block adding another 10, making 50. But wait, 40-49 is in the first block (1-100), 140-149 in the second (101-200), 240-249 in the third (201-300), 340-349 in the fourth (301-400), and 440-449 in the fifth (401-500), but our book ends at 488. So, 440-449 is entirely within 488, so yes, 10 numbers. So, total 5 blocks, each with 10, so 50. That's correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, how many numbers? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times. Correct.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That's correct.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The last term is 488. So, 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 times. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: The tens digit is 8. So, in each block of 100, it's 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. However, our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, how many blocks? The first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 numbers, contributing 10 each, so 4*10=40. The last block (480-488) contributes 9 numbers. So, total 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: As mentioned, no page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place, so 0.\n\nSo, 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit surprised that the difference is 90. Let me think if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately by considering each digit position again, but perhaps using a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nAnother way is to consider each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) and calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor any digit position, the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated by:\n\n- For the units place: The number of complete groups of 10, each contributing one occurrence of d, plus any extra in the incomplete group.\n\nSimilarly for tens and hundreds places.\n\nSo, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: floor(488 / 10) = 48 complete groups, each contributing 1, and the remainder is 8, so if 4 \u2264 8, add 1. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: floor(488 / 100) = 4 complete groups, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, the remainder is 88, so the tens digit cycles from 0-9, so how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in the last partial group (400-488). The tens digit cycles every 100, so in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: floor(488 / 1000) = 0 complete groups, but the hundreds digit in 400-488 is 4, so the number of times 4 appears is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: floor(488 / 10) = 48, plus if 8 \u2264 8, add 1. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: floor(488 / 100) = 4, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, the remainder is 88, so in the last partial group (400-488), the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: As before, 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that confirms the earlier result. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 times, plus one more in the partial set (484), totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks (including 440-449), each contributing 10 times, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, the hundreds digit is '4' for 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to '4', '8' appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n   - **Tens Place:** '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, etc., with 4 full blocks contributing 40 times, plus 9 times in the partial block (480-488), totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No page numbers have '8' in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'. \n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by thinking about how to count the number of times a digit appears in each position. For example, in the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place. Maybe I should handle each digit position separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. For the units digit, every 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for the digit 8. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1, which is 48, plus any additional 4's in the remaining 8 numbers. Wait, the remaining numbers after 480 would be 481 to 488. So, in the units place, how many 4's are there? Let me check: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The digit 4 appears once in 484. So, total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, each group of 10 has one 8, so 48 times 1 is 48, plus the remaining numbers. The remaining numbers are 481 to 488, so in the units place, 8 appears in 488. So, that's one more, making it 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, so both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place? That seems interesting.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in 80-89, 10 times. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and the tens digit 8 appears 10 times. So, for the first 400 pages, the number of 4's in the tens place is 4*10=40, and same for 8's: 4*10=40.\n\nNow, let's look at the last 88 pages, from 401 to 488. In these, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see: pages 440-449 would have 4 in the tens place. That's 10 pages, but wait, 488 is only up to 488, so 440-449 is within 401-488. So, that's 10 times. Similarly, how about 8 in the tens place? Pages 480-488 would have 8 in the tens place, but wait, 480 is 480, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages (480, 481,...,488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. Wait, but 480 is part of the 401-488 range, so yes, 480-488 is 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, in the tens place, for the last 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total tens place 4's: 40 (from first four hundreds) + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal tens place 8's: 40 (from first four hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times.\n\nNow, let's move to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 4's: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in 481-488, 484 has a 4 in the units place, so 49 total. Same for 8's: 48 full groups, each contributing 1, plus 488, so 49 total. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For the first 400 pages, 4 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, so 40+10=50. For 8's, first 400 pages: 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, 0. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Total 8's:49+49+0=98. Difference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me check again. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about each position separately again to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a formula to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position up to a certain number.\n\nI remember that for a given digit d and position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times d appears can be calculated using a formula based on higher digits, current digit, and lower digits. But maybe that's more complicated than just counting as I did before.\n\nWait, maybe I should try another approach to verify.\n\nLet me consider the units digit again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, once, so 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last partial cycle (481-488), how many 4's? Only 484, so one more, total 49. Same for 8's: 48 full cycles, each contributing 1, plus 488, so 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for the first 400 pages, that's 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40 times. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles again. The tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., 8 for 480-488. So, in the tens place, 4 appears when the tens digit is 4, which is 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 more, making total 50. For 8's in the tens place, it's when the tens digit is 8, which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more, making total 49.\n\nHundreds place: As before, 4 appears 89 times, 8 doesn't appear.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's total:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 times the hundreds digit is 4. Correct.\n\nWait, but when I think about page 400, that's 400, which is the first page with 4 in the hundreds place, and 488 is the last. So, yes, 89 numbers.\n\nI think my calculation is correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so 188-98=90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each group of 10 numbers contributes one 4. There are 48 full groups (480 numbers) contributing 48 fours. In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 484 adds one more 4. Total: 49.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, 48 full groups contribute 48 eights. The number 488 adds one more 8. Total: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. For the first 400 pages, this is 4*10=40. From 401-488, 440-449 adds 10 more. Total: 50.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, 4*10=40 eights from the first 400 pages. From 401-488, 480-488 adds 9 eights. Total: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n   - **8's:** No page number has 8 in the hundreds place. Total: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each place and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the pattern repeats every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and considering any remainder.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, the pattern repeats every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, in the tens place, the digit 4 would appear 10 times in 0-99, 10 times in 100-199, and so on.\n\nThe same logic applies to the hundreds place, but since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds place can only be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, actually, in page numbers from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, and from 100 onwards, it's 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, I need to be careful with the hundreds place because 488 is less than 500.\n\nLet me structure this:\n\n1. Calculate the number of 4's in the units place.\n2. Calculate the number of 4's in the tens place.\n3. Calculate the number of 4's in the hundreds place.\n4. Do the same for 8's.\n5. Subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's.\n\nStarting with the units place for 4's:\n\nTotal pages = 488.\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10 in 488 is 48 (since 48*10=480). Each group contributes 1 occurrence of 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, from 1 to 480, that's 48 groups, each contributing 1, so 48*1=48. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so there's another 4 in 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1 to 480, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place, so 480/10=48. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, the digit 4 appears once more in 484. So, total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, units place for 8's:\n\nSimilarly, in each group of 10, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, total complete groups of 10 are 48, contributing 48 occurrences. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go up to 8, so another 8 in 488. So, units 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so yes, that's correct.\n\nNext, the tens place for 4's:\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, from 0-99, 10 times; 100-199, another 10 times; 200-299, another 10; 300-399, another 10; and 400-488, how many times?\n\nWait, from 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the digit 4 in the tens place would be from 440-449, which is 10 times. So, in each hundred, 10 times, except the last one which is only up to 488, but since 440-449 is within 400-488, it's still 10 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's in the tens place: 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus 10 in 400-488, so total 50.\n\nWait, hold on, 0-99 is the first hundred, then 100-199 is the second, 200-299 third, 300-399 fourth, and 400-488 is the fifth, but in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 times. So, 5 hundreds, but the fifth is only up to 488, but since 440-449 is within 400-488, it's still 10 times. So, 5*10=50.\n\nWait, but actually, 0-99 is the first hundred, then 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488 is the fifth hundred, but it's incomplete. However, for the tens digit, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, regardless of how high the number goes beyond that hundred, as long as it's within the same hundred. Wait, no, because 400-488 is not a complete hundred; it's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, in 400-488, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8, so the digit 4 in the tens place occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 10 times. Therefore, total tens 4's: 5*10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\nIn each hundred, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 0-99: 10 times (80-89), 100-199: 10 times (180-189), 200-299: 10 times (280-289), 300-399: 10 times (380-389), and 400-488: how many times? The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 times (480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so 9 times. Wait, but in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8, so it's 9 times. So, total tens 8's: 4*10 (from the first four hundreds) plus 9 (from 400-488). So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. From 0-99: 80-89: 10 times. 100-199: 180-189: 10. 200-299: 280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. Then 400-488: the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nSo, tens place: 4's=50, 8's=49.\n\nNow, hundreds place for 4's:\n\nIn the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in all page numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but page numbers start at 1, so from 1 to 99, hundreds digit is 0, which isn't printed, right? So, the hundreds digit is only printed when the page number is 100 or above. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 times.\n\nNow, hundreds place for 8's:\n\nThe digit 8 in the hundreds place would appear in page numbers from 800 to 899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place 8's=0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's and 8's.\n\nTotal 4's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's=49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's=49+49+0=98.\n\nNow, the difference is total 4's - total 8's=188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nUnits place 4's:49, 8's:49. Correct.\n\nTens place 4's:50, 8's:49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place 4's:89, 8's:0. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's=49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's=49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference=188-98=90.\n\nHmm, but wait, let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but when counting the tens and units places, did I count correctly?\n\nUnits place: For 4's, 48 full groups of 10 (1-480), each contributing 1, so 48, plus 1 more in 484, total 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: For 4's, in each hundred, 10 times, so 5 hundreds (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488), but in 400-488, it's 10 times as 440-449. So, 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place: 4 full hundreds contributing 10 each, and the last partial hundred (400-488) contributing 9, so 49. Correct.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 188, and 8's are 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a big number. Let me try a different approach to verify.\n\nAnother way is to count the number of 4's and 8's in each position separately.\n\nLet's do that.\n\nUnits digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: For each 10 numbers, there's one 4. So, total number of 4's in units place is floor(488/10) =48, plus if the last partial group has a 4. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, and the remainder is 8. So, from 1 to 488, the units digit 4 appears 48 times, plus one more if the last group includes 484. Since 484 is within 481-488, yes, so total 49.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: floor(488/10)=48, and the last group has 8 in 488, so 49.\n\nTens digit:\n\nFor the tens digit, each 100 numbers have 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, total number of 4's in tens place is (number of hundreds) *10. Number of hundreds is 4 (since 488 is less than 500), but wait, actually, it's 5 hundreds: 0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488. But in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total 5*10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place: Each hundred has 10 occurrences, but in the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 times. So, total 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds digit:\n\nOnly the hundreds digit 4 occurs from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times.\n\nHundreds digit 8 occurs from 800-899, but since the book only goes to 488, it's 0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the answer.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every set of ten numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4) and 8 appears once (page 8). Similarly, from 11-20, 4 appears once (page 14) and 8 appears once (page 18), and so on.\n\nNow, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 extra pages (481-488). So, for the units place, in each of the 48 complete sets, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, that's 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, in these, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, which is also 49.\n\nWait, but I should check if the remaining pages are 481-488, which is 8 pages, so units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So, units place: 49 each.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). In each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89).\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, which is 4 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, no, actually, it's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. 488 is 4 full hundreds (100, 200, 300, 400) plus 88 more pages. So, from 1-400, there are 4 full hundreds, and then 401-488 is 88 pages.\n\nSo, for the tens place, in each full hundred, 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49 in each hundred), so 4 times 10 is 40. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, so 4 times 10 is 40.\n\nNow, what about the remaining 88 pages (401-488)? Let's see, the tens digit here goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers if you count 480 as the first, but actually, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. Wait, no, 488 - 480 = 8, so 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in 480-488.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The tens digit in 480-488 is 8 for all of them, right? So, 480 has tens digit 8, 481 has 8, up to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 times. So, in the tens place, for the remaining 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total in the tens place: 4's = 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 = 50, and 8's = 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off because in 401-488, the tens digit for 4's is only in 440-449, which is 10 times, and for 8's, it's 480-488, which is 9 times. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, the digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences of 4's and 8's across all digit places.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 49 + 49 is 98, and adding 0 gives 98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me recount the hundreds place for 4's. Pages 400 to 488: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these 89 pages, so 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nFor the tens place, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, 10 and 9 respectively. So, 4's in tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) +10 =50, and 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8, plus the last 8 pages contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48*1 +1=49 each.\n\nSo, 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems a large difference. Let me check another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately, but perhaps I made a mistake in the tens place for 4's.\n\nWait, let's think again about the tens place. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, so each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred. So, for 488 pages, that's 4 full hundreds (1-400) and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each full hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.), the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49 in each hundred), so 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 times for 4's. Similarly, 8's would be 4*10=40 times.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? It appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, that's 10 more for 4's, making it 40+10=50.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages: the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 times (from 480 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 9 more for 8's, making it 40+9=49.\n\nSo, that part seems correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: 4's appear 89 times (400-488), and 8's don't appear at all.\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each, plus in the last 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So, units place: 48+1=49 for both 4's and 8's.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent, but I want to make sure I didn't double-count or miss any pages.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to consider each digit place separately and calculate how many times each digit appears in that place.\n\nFor units place:\n\nTotal number of units digits is 488. Each digit from 0-9 appears equally often except possibly the last digit if 488 isn't a multiple of 10.\n\nSo, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full cycles, with 8 remaining.\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place, and then in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so digits 1-8 each get one more, and 9 and 0 don't.\n\nSo, digit 4 appears 48 +1=49 times in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, digit 8 appears 48 +1=49 times.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred. So, for 488 pages, that's 4 full hundreds and 88 pages.\n\nIn each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 40 times for each digit.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488).\n\nSo, for each digit from 0-8, how many times do they appear in the tens place in 401-488?\n\nFor digits 0-7: each appears 10 times in each hundred, but in the last partial hundred, they appear once more for each digit except 8.\n\nWait, no. Let me think differently. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, for each digit d from 0 to 8, the number of times d appears in the tens place is 10 times if d is less than 8, and 9 times if d is 8.\n\nWait, no, actually, for each digit d, the number of times it appears in the tens place in 401-488 is 10 if d is less than 8, because each digit from 0-8 appears in 10 numbers except for 8, which appears in 9 numbers (480-488).\n\nWait, let's take an example. For digit 0: 401-410, which is 10 numbers, so digit 0 appears 10 times.\n\nFor digit 1: 410-419, but wait, 410 is included in 401-488, so 410-419 is 10 numbers, so digit 1 appears 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, up to digit 7: each appears 10 times in their respective decades.\n\nDigit 8: appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place in 401-488:\n\n- Digits 0-7: 10 times each\n- Digit 8: 9 times\n\nSo, for digit 4, which is in 0-7, it appears 10 times in the tens place in the last 88 pages.\n\nSimilarly, digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, total in tens place:\n\n- 4's: 4*10 (from full hundreds) +10 (from last partial hundred) =50\n- 8's:4*10 +9=49\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I had before.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nEach hundred block contributes 100 numbers, and the hundreds digit is fixed for each block.\n\nSo, for 1-100: hundreds digit is 1, 100 times.\n\n101-200: hundreds digit is 2, 100 times.\n\n201-300: hundreds digit is 3, 100 times.\n\n301-400: hundreds digit is 4, 100 times.\n\n401-488: hundreds digit is 4, 88 times.\n\nSo, digit 4 appears in the hundreds place 100 (from 400) +88=188 times? Wait, no, wait.\n\nWait, no, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, not 88. Because 488-400+1=89.\n\nSo, digit 4 appears 100 times in 400-499, but since we only go up to 488, it's 89 times.\n\nWait, no, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those 89 numbers.\n\nSo, digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nDigit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because 800 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place:89.\n\n8's in hundreds place:0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89)=188.\n\n8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in the hundreds place calculation. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each, so 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nAnother way: total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so 188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in each position, except maybe the last few pages if the total isn't a multiple of 10. But since 488 is the last page, I need to check how many complete sets of 10 there are and then see if there's a partial set.\n\nWait, actually, in each complete set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1-10, the digits in the units place are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So each digit appears once. Similarly, from 11-20, the units digits again cycle through 0-9. So, for each group of 10, each digit appears once in the units place.\n\nNow, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Let me divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra pages (481-488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times for each complete group, and then in the extra 8 pages, we have 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Looking at the units digits here, 481 has 1, 482 has 2, 483 has 3, 484 has 4, 485 has 5, 486 has 6, 487 has 7, and 488 has 8. So, in the units place of the extra 8 pages, the digit 4 appears once (in 484). Therefore, total 4's in the units place are 48 (from complete groups) + 1 (from extra) = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place: in each complete group of 10, 8 appears once, so 48 times. In the extra 8 pages, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total 8's in units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the difference here is zero. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nTotal page numbers: 488. Divided by 10, we get 48 full decades and 8 extra pages. Each decade contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times each. Then, in the extra pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, yes, 48 +1 =49 for both. So, units place gives no difference.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. This is a bit trickier because the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nLet's break down the page numbers into hundreds. The book goes up to 488, so we have:\n\n- Pages 1-99: these are the first 99 pages.\n- Pages 100-488: these are the remaining pages.\n\nWait, but 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, perhaps it's better to consider each hundred separately.\n\nWait, but page numbers start at 1, so pages 1-9 are single-digit, 10-99 are two-digit, and 100-488 are three-digit. So, maybe I should handle the tens place for two-digit and three-digit numbers separately.\n\nLet me think: For the tens place, in the two-digit numbers (10-99), each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So, for example, 10-19 have 1 in the tens place, 20-29 have 2, etc., up to 90-99 having 9. So, in the two-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89).\n\nNow, for the three-digit numbers, from 100-488. The tens digit can be 0-9 for each hundred. So, for each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred block, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nBut wait, 400-488 is only 88 pages, so the tens digit in 400-488 goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, 400-488 includes 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit in 400-488 goes from 0 to 8, but each tens digit from 0-8 appears 10 times except for 8, which appears only 9 times because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, 400-488 includes 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). So, in the tens place, for 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except for 8, which appears 9 times because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 pages. So, the tens digit in the hundreds place for 400-488 is as follows:\n\n- 400-409: tens digit 0, 10 pages\n- 410-419: tens digit 1, 10 pages\n- 420-429: tens digit 2, 10 pages\n- 430-439: tens digit 3, 10 pages\n- 440-449: tens digit 4, 10 pages\n- 450-459: tens digit 5, 10 pages\n- 460-469: tens digit 6, 10 pages\n- 470-479: tens digit 7, 10 pages\n- 480-488: tens digit 8, 9 pages (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, in the tens place for 400-488, the digit 8 appears 9 times, and all other digits from 0-7 appear 10 times. The digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in 440-449.\n\nSo, now, let's calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place across all page numbers.\n\nFirst, for two-digit numbers (10-99):\n\n- 4 appears 10 times (40-49)\n- 8 appears 10 times (80-89)\n\nFor three-digit numbers (100-488):\n\n- For hundreds 100-399: each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place. There are 3 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), so 3*10=30 for each digit.\n\n- For hundreds 400-488: as above, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, total for tens place:\n\n- 4's: 10 (from 10-99) + 30 (from 100-399) +10 (from 400-488) = 50\n- 8's: 10 (from 10-99) + 30 (from 100-399) +9 (from 400-488) = 49\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times, giving a difference of 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present in three-digit numbers, i.e., pages 100-488.\n\nIn the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 4 appears, since the book ends at 488. So, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, appearing 100 times.\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, appearing 100 times.\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, appearing 100 times.\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times (since 488 - 400 +1 =89).\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times, and the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the hundreds digit only goes up to 4.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nSo, the difference here is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts from each digit place.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nAdding them up:\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 49 for both 4 and 8. Tens place: 50 for 4, 49 for 8. Hundreds place: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 + 50 +89 = 188\n\n8's:49 +49 +0 =98\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for the three-digit numbers. For 100-399, each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 3 hundreds would be 30 each. Then, 400-488 contributes 10 4's and 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 4's in tens place:30+10=40? Wait, no, wait, in the two-digit numbers, it's 10 for 4 and 10 for 8. Then, for three-digit numbers, 100-399:3 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's, so 3*10=30 each. Then, 400-488:10 4's and 9 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place:10 (two-digit) +30 (100-399) +10 (400-488)=50\n\nSimilarly, 8's in tens place:10 (two-digit) +30 (100-399) +9 (400-488)=49\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4's:89, 8's:0\n\nUnits place:49 each.\n\nSo, total 4's:50 (tens) +49 (units) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\nTotal 8's:49 (tens) +49 (units) +0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because when I first thought about it, I didn't expect such a large difference. Let me think if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately and then sum them up.\n\nFor units place:\n\n- Each digit 0-9 appears equally in each position, except possibly the last partial group.\n\nTotal pages:488\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10:48 (since 48*10=480), with 8 remaining pages (481-488).\n\nIn each complete group, digit 4 appears once in units place, same for 8.\n\nSo, 48 groups *1=48 for each digit.\n\nIn the remaining 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8.\n\nSo, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\nThus, total units place:\n\n4's:48+1=49\n\n8's:48+1=49\n\nSame as before.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach digit appears 10 times per hundred.\n\nFor two-digit numbers (10-99):\n\n- 4 appears 10 times (40-49)\n- 8 appears 10 times (80-89)\n\nFor three-digit numbers (100-488):\n\nEach hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, 3 hundreds *10=30 each.\n\nFor 400-488:\n\nTens digits go from 0-8, each appearing 10 times except 8, which appears 9 times (since 488 is the last page).\n\nSo, in 400-488:\n\n- 4's in tens place:10 (440-449)\n- 8's in tens place:9 (480-488)\n\nSo, total in three-digit numbers:\n\n4's:30 +10=40\n\n8's:30 +9=39\n\nWait, but wait, earlier I thought of it as 30 from 100-399 and 10 from 400-488 for 4's, totaling 40, and 30 from 100-399 and 9 from 400-488 for 8's, totaling 39.\n\nBut then, adding the two-digit numbers:\n\n4's:10 (tens place) +40=50\n\n8's:10 (tens place) +39=49\n\nWhich matches what I had earlier.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly in three-digit numbers, 100-488.\n\n- 4 appears in hundreds place 89 times (400-488)\n- 8 never appears in hundreds place.\n\nSo, 4's:89\n\n8's:0\n\nThus, total 4's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:50\n\nHundreds:89\n\nTotal:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:49\n\nHundreds:0\n\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try another approach, perhaps using a formula or a different counting method.\n\nAnother way to count the number of times a digit appears in each position is to consider each digit place separately and calculate how many times each digit appears.\n\nFor the units place, as before, each digit 0-9 appears equally in each complete group of 10, and then we handle the remaining pages.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, each digit appears 10 times in each hundred, except for the last partial hundred, where it might be less.\n\nAnd for the hundreds place, each digit appears 100 times for each hundred, except for the last partial hundred.\n\nSo, using this method, let's recalculate.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(488/10)=48, remainder=8.\n\nEach complete group contributes 1 occurrence of each digit in units place.\n\nSo, 4's:48\n\n8's:48\n\nIn the remaining 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\n\nThus, 4's:48+1=49\n\n8's:48+1=49\n\nTens place:\n\nEach digit appears 10 times in each hundred.\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: floor(488/100)=4, but since 488 is less than 500, the hundreds digit goes up to 4.\n\nBut for the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n\nSo, for each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.), the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each.\n\nBut wait, actually, for the tens place, each hundred block (e.g., 1-100) has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place, except for the first hundred, which is 1-100, but 1-9 are single-digit, so their tens digit is 0. Wait, no, in the tens place, for 1-9, the tens digit is 0, so from 1-99, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each, except for 0, which appears 9 times (from 1-9, tens digit is 0, and then 10-19, 20-29, etc., each have 10 occurrences of the tens digit). Wait, no, from 1-99, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, and then for each ten group (10-19, etc.), the tens digit is 1-9 each appearing 10 times. So, in 1-99, the tens digit 0 appears 9 times (pages 1-9) and digits 1-9 appear 10 times each. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier.\n\nWait, this is a mistake I made earlier. I assumed that in 1-99, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place, but actually, the tens digit is 0 for pages 1-9, so digit 0 appears 9 times, and digits 1-9 appear 10 times each in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, but the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each hundred. So, in 100-199, the tens digit 0 appears 10 times (100-109), 1 appears 10 times (110-119), etc., up to 9 appearing 10 times (190-199). So, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred block.\n\nWait, but in 1-99, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, so that's 9 times, and 1-9 each appear 10 times in the tens place (from 10-19, etc.). So, in 1-99:\n\n- Tens digit 0:9 times\n- Tens digits 1-9:10 times each\n\nSimilarly, in 100-199:\n\n- Tens digits 0-9:10 times each\n\nSame for 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nSo, let's correct the earlier calculation for the tens place.\n\nFirst, two-digit numbers (10-99):\n\n- Tens digits 1-9:10 times each\n\nSo, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\nNow, three-digit numbers (100-488):\n\nEach hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place.\n\nSo, for each of these hundreds:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times in the tens place\n- 8 appears 10 times in the tens place\n\nSo, 3 hundreds contribute 30 each.\n\nNow, 400-488:\n\nThis is 89 pages, so the tens digits go from 0-8, each appearing 10 times except for 8, which appears 9 times (since 488 is the last page).\n\nWait, no, let's think again. From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). Each tens digit from 0-7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times because 488 is the last page. So, in 400-488:\n\n- Tens digit 4:10 times (440-449)\n- Tens digit 8:9 times (480-488)\n\nSo, in the tens place for 400-488:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times\n- 8 appears 9 times\n\nTherefore, total in three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's in tens place:3 hundreds *10 +10=40\n- 8's in tens place:3 hundreds *10 +9=39\n\nAdding the two-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's in tens place:10\n- 8's in tens place:10\n\nTotal:\n\n- 4's in tens place:10 +40=50\n- 8's in tens place:10 +39=49\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nIn 100-488, the hundreds digit is 1,2,3, or 4.\n\n- 100-199: hundreds digit 1, 100 times\n- 200-299: hundreds digit 2, 100 times\n- 300-399: hundreds digit 3, 100 times\n- 400-488: hundreds digit 4, 89 times\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times\n- 8 never appears\n\nThus, total 4's in hundreds place:89\n\n8's:0\n\nNow, adding up all the digit positions:\n\n4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50+89=188\n\n8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nSo, after carefully rechecking, I confirm that the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately:\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place.\n   - Complete groups of 10: 48 groups, each contributing one 4 and one 8.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488) contribute one 4 and one 8.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences each for 4 and 8.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - For two-digit numbers (10-99): 10 occurrences each of 4 and 8.\n   - For three-digit numbers (100-488): Each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributes 10 each of 4 and 8. The partial block 400-488 contributes 10 for 4 and 9 for 8.\n   - Total: 50 for 4, 49 for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - Only appears in three-digit numbers.\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488), while 8 never appears.\n\nSumming these:\n- Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each position in the page numbers separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nFirst, for the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4); from 11-20, it appears once (page 14), and so on. So, I can calculate how many complete sets of ten there are in 488 pages and then see how many 4's are in the units place.\n\nWait, but maybe I should approach it more systematically. Let's think about each digit position separately.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor the units digit, the number of times 4 appears can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and taking the integer part, then adding 1 if the units digit of the total number is 4 or higher. But actually, since 488 is the last page, the units digit cycles every 10 pages.\n\nSo, the number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of complete tens in 488, which is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets of ten). Each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, I think I need to check if the last partial set (pages 481-488) includes a 4 in the units place. The last page is 488, so the units digits go from 1 to 8 in the last set. So, 481, 482, ..., 488. The units digit 4 appears once here (484). So, total units place 4's would be 48 (from the complete sets) plus 1, making it 49.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Each complete set of ten pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) contributes exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from page 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of ten, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, which is 8 pages, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 is the only page with a 4 in the units place here. So, that's one more. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit is 4 when the page numbers are from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range, but 540-549 would be beyond 488, so we don't have that.\n\nSo, how many times does the digit 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nEach of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let's see:\n\n- 40-49: 10 pages\n- 140-149: 10 pages\n- 240-249: 10 pages\n- 340-349: 10 pages\n- 440-449: 10 pages\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's five sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is fully included in 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. From 40-49: 10 pages, that's correct. Then 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. So, that's 5 sets, 10 each, so 50.\n\nNow, what about the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 when the page numbers are from 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place?\n\nFrom 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Page 400: hundreds digit is 4, page 401: same, up to 488. So, that's 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake. The hundreds place: from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, the digit 8 appears once every 10 pages in the units place.\n\nSo, total units place 8's: from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nEach set of ten contributes one 8. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is included, which is an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, tens place: the digit 8 appears in the tens place in page numbers from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's.\n\nSo, each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences except possibly the last one if it's cut short.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 pages\n- 180-189: 10 pages\n- 280-289: 10 pages\n- 380-389: 10 pages\n- 480-488: 9 pages (since 488 is the last page)\n\nWait, 480-488 is 9 pages because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, in the tens place, each of the first four ranges contributes 10 8's, and the last one contributes 9.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4 * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, hundreds place: the hundreds digit is 8 when the page numbers are from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so number of 4's is 188 and number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 188 seems high for 4's.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nTens place: 50.\n\nHundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nTens place: 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal: 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a lot. Let me see if there's another way to approach this, maybe by calculating digit by digit.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a formula for each digit position.\n\nFor each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated as follows:\n\nLet's denote the positions as units (position 1), tens (position 2), hundreds (position 3).\n\nFor each position i (starting from 1), the number of times digit d appears is:\n\nhigher = number formed by digits higher than position i.\n\ncurrent = digit at position i.\n\nlower = number formed by digits lower than position i.\n\nThen, the count is:\n\nif current > d: (higher + 1) * 10^(i-1)\n\nif current == d: higher * 10^(i-1) + lower + 1\n\nif current < d: higher * 10^(i-1)\n\nBut maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, I can think in terms of how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try calculating the 4's again.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nWell, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 484 is included, so one more. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears in the tens digit for numbers 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n\nEach of these ranges is 10 numbers, so 10 each.\n\nHow many such ranges are there?\n\nFrom 40-49: 10 numbers.\n\nThen, 140-149: another 10.\n\n240-249: another 10.\n\n340-349: another 10.\n\n440-449: another 10.\n\nThat's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50.\n\nSo, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488.\n\nThat's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nSo, 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place:\n\nSame as 4's, 49 times.\n\nTens place:\n\n8 appears in tens place in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n\nEach of the first four ranges is 10 numbers, so 4*10=40.\n\nThe last range, 480-488, is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page), so 9.\n\nTotal tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNo pages from 800-899, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 188 seemed high, but upon recounting, it seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nSo, yes, 89.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, 50 times.\n\nUnits place, 49.\n\nSo, 188 total 4's.\n\nFor 8's, units and tens each 49, so 98.\n\nThus, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, let me think about the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nFor 8's, since the book ends at 488, there's no hundreds digit 8. So, 0.\n\nYes, so 98 8's in total.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I think it's easier to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, for the digit 4. I'll go through each position one by one.\n\n1. Units place: For every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; 11-20, it's 14; and so on. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 fours. But wait, in the last partial group from 481 to 488, the units digit is 4 in 484. So, that's one more 4. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Similarly, for the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, 10 times in each block. For example, 40-49 has the tens digit as 4 for all 10 numbers. So, how many such blocks are there in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks. Each contributes 10 fours, so 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Now, in the last partial block (400-488), the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 in that block, which is 10 numbers (400-409). Wait, but 488 is beyond 409, so actually, from 400 to 488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, which is 10 times. So, that's another 10 fours. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 in the page numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4 appears 188 times.\n\nWait, hold on, that seems high. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. Units place: 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus one more in the last partial decade (484), so 49. Tens place: 4 full centuries (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs from 400-409, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, 40 + 10 = 50. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. Units place: For every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. In the last partial group (481-488), the units digit 8 is in 488, so that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many such blocks are there in 488? 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 complete blocks. Each contributes 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial block (400-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in page numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 1-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 80-89 (10 times), 180-189 (10 times), 280-289 (10 times), 380-389 (10 times), and 480-488 (9 times). So that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I added up the 4's, I got 188, and for 8's, 98, so the difference is 90. But let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Units place for 4's: 48 full groups (1-480), each contributing one 4, so 48, plus 484, which is the 481-488 group, so that's one more, making 49. Tens place for 4's: 4 full centuries (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 is in 400-409, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, 40 + 10 = 50. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's: units place is 49, tens place is 49, hundreds place is 0, so total 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the tens and hundreds places, it's easy to miscount. Let me try a different approach to verify.\n\nAnother way is to count the number of 4's and 8's in each position separately.\n\nFor the units place:\n\n- Number of 4's: floor(488/10) = 48, plus if the last partial group has a 4, which it does (484), so 48 +1 =49.\n\n- Number of 8's: floor(488/10)=48, plus if the last partial group has an 8, which it does (488), so 48 +1=49.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\n- Number of 4's: floor(488/100)=4, each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. Total: 40 +10=50.\n\n- Number of 8's: floor(488/100)=4, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. Total: 40 +9=49.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\n- Number of 4's: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\n- Number of 8's: none, since 800 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full groups of 10 (480) plus one in 484 \u2192 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full centuries (400) plus 10 in 400-409 \u2192 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 numbers from 400-488 \u2192 89.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full groups of 10 (480) plus one in 488 \u2192 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full centuries (400) plus 9 in 480-488 \u2192 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as 800 is beyond 488 \u2192 0.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by calculating the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the units place: In every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then a partial block of 8. Each full block contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. In the partial block from 481 to 488, the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a block of 100 numbers. Specifically, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, the last block, 440-449, only goes up to 488, so actually, it's from 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's.\n\nAdding them up: Units place (49) + Tens place (50) + Hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full blocks of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the partial block from 481 to 488 includes 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers, since 488 is the last page). So, let's count:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 8's in tens place.\n- 180-189: 10 numbers, 10 8's.\n- 280-289: 10 numbers, 10 8's.\n- 380-389: 10 numbers, 10 8's.\n- 480-488: 9 numbers, 9 8's.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0.\n\nAdding them up: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, total 4's are 188 and total 8's are 98. Now, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488 is indeed 89 numbers, so 89 4's. For the tens place, 5 blocks each with 10 4's, so 50. Units place 49. 89 + 50 = 139, 139 + 49 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's, units place is 49, which is correct because 48 full tens and one partial with 8. Tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each with 10, so 40, plus the last block 480-488, which is 9, so 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 in units and 49 in tens, total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. The block 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, that's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place, correct. So, 9 8's there. So, 4 blocks of 10 (each contributing 10) and one block of 9, so 4*10 +9=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's in the tens place, the last block is 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's fine. So, 5 blocks, 5*10=50. So, that's correct.\n\nI think my calculations are accurate. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full decades (480 numbers) and an additional 8 numbers (481-488). So, 48 + 1 = 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full decades and an additional 8 numbers (481-488). So, 48 + 1 = 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full blocks and a partial block (480-488). So, 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

I'll need to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, for the units place. In the units place, the digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers contributes one 4. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a count, it's 48 full blocks. But wait, in each block, the 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, that would be 48 times. However, I should check if the last partial block (if any) has a 4 in the units place. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, the last block is 480-488. The units digits go from 0 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So, total units place 4's are 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a block of 10 numbers every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, each hundred has one such block. So, from 1-100, 40-49 is one block, from 101-200, 140-149 is another, from 201-300, 240-249, and from 301-400, 340-349. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488. So, how many blocks is that? Let me count: 1-100: 1 block, 101-200: 1 block, 201-300: 1 block, 301-400: 1 block, and 401-488: 1 block (440-449). So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. So, the tens place contributes 50 4's.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nAdding up the units, tens, and hundreds places: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. So, the total number of 4's printed is 187.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, the last block is 480-488, and the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for a block of 10 numbers every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see:\n\nFrom 1-100: 80-89 is one block (10 numbers)\nFrom 101-200: 180-189 is another block\nFrom 201-300: 280-289\nFrom 301-400: 380-389\nFrom 401-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's another block of 9 numbers. So, total blocks: 4 full blocks (each 10 numbers) and one partial block of 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me double-check. From 1-100: 80-89: 10\n101-200: 180-189: 10\n201-300: 280-289: 10\n301-400: 380-389: 10\n401-488: 480-488: 9 (since 488 is included)\nSo, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, yes, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's from the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up units, tens, and hundreds: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So, total number of 8's printed is 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's and 8's again.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 (since 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full tens, and the last partial doesn't include a 4 in units)\n- Tens: 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449) each contributing 10, so 5*10=50\n- Hundreds: 400-488: 89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place\nTotal: 48+50+89=187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and the last partial ten (480-488) has an 8 in 488, so 49\n- Tens: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 4 full blocks of 10 and one partial of 9, so 4*10 +9=49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49+49=98. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 187-98=89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"
