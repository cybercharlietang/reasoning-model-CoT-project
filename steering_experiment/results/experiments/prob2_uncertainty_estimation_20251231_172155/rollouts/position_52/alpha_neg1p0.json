Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for eights, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers. Let me confirm that: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, right? Because 488 -480 +1=9. So, that's correct. Similarly, for the units place, 488 is included, so 488 is counted as an 8 in the units place. So, that's correct. Similarly, for fours in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, that's correct. So, yeah, the difference is 90.
