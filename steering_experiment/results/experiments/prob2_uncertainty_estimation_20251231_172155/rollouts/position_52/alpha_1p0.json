And for the tens place, in fours, we had 50, which is 10 per hundred block times 5 blocks (40-49,140-149, etc.), but wait, 400-488 is part of the hundreds place, so the tens digit 4 in 440-449 is part of the tens count, which we included as 50. Hmm, seems correct. Similarly, for eights, the tens place in 480-488 is 9, which is correct because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So yes, 9 there.

    "text": " Wait, but let me confirm. The hundreds digit is 8 only in page numbers 800 and above, but since the book is 488 pages, the highest page is 488, so the hundreds digit is 4, not 8. So, no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights are units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, units place:49, tens place:49, so total eights are 49 +49=98. But wait, in the tens place, I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, that's correct. So, total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that can't be right because when I think about it, the hundreds place for fours contributes a lot more. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I thought maybe I made a mistake because 90 seems a bit high, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I overcounted the fours in the hundreds place. Let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. That's correct. For the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Units place: every 10 numbers, so 4,14,...,484. How many? The last one is 484, which is 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. So, 49 fours. So, 89+50+49=188. For eights, units place:8,18,...,488. How many? 488-8=480, 480/10=48, so 49 numbers. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets is 10 numbers, and the last set is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for eights. From 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, the difference is indeed 90.

Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98.

    "text": " Wait, let me make sure. The hundreds digit can be 4 or less, so no 8's in hundreds place. So total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me check again. Units place:49, tens:49, so 98 eights. Hmm, but earlier for fours, I had 188. So, the difference would be 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for eights. Let me recount the tens place for eights. From 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, fours:188, eights:98, difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but wait a second. Let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188. That seems correct. Units for eights:49, tens:49, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check if I counted correctly for the units and tens places. For units place fours: from 4,14,...,484. How many terms? (484-4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. For tens place fours: each hundred has 10, and there are 5 hundreds (0-9, 100-199, etc.), but wait, up to 488. So, 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place:400-488:89. So, 50+49+89=188. For eights: units place:8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). This results in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). This results in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
