Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Checking fours: units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 188. Eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. Difference:188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't overcount in any place. For example, in the units place for fours, I had 484 as the last number, which is 484. So, from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. That's correct. For the tens place, fours: from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449.

For eights: units place:8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, and the last block (480-488) has 9 numbers. So, 4x10=40, plus 9=49. Correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90.
