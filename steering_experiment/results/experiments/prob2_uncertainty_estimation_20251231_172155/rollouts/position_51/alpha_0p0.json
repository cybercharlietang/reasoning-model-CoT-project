For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That's correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for eights, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, 480-488: 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, that's correct. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because I thought maybe the hundreds place for fours might be 89, but let me confirm that.
