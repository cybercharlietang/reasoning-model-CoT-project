So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check again. Wait, when I counted the tens place for 4's, I had 50 fours. But when I counted the tens place for 8's, I had 49. Similarly, units place for 4's was 49, and for 8's was 49. So, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488 - 400 +1 =89.

That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. That seems correct. For 8's in tens place, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 49 in total. So, 49 eights in tens place. So, units place for 4's: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.

So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n\nWait, let me check again because I might have made a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place. When I did the tens place, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, but actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 -480 +1 =9. So, 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place for that set. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49, which is correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the fours again. For the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. Then, tens place: 50 fours, and units:49. So, 89+50=139, plus 49 is 188. So, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to check: Maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's separately using a different approach. For example, for each digit position, count how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nLet me try that for the units place:\n\n- For units place, numbers from 1-488. The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, so total occurrences are floor(488/10) +1 if the last number is beyond 488. Wait, 488/10=48.8, so floor(48.8)=48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times, which matches my earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place, same calculation: floor(488/10)=48, plus 1 because 488 ends with 8, so 49 times. So, correct.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\n- For 4 in tens place, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Correct.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place, similar approach: 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. So, that's 5 sets, but the last set is only 9 numbers, so 49 eights. So, correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so 800-899 isn't included. So, correct.\n\nSo, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any numbers. For example, in the number 444, the digit 4 appears three times. So, when I count units, tens, and hundreds, each occurrence is counted separately, which is correct because each digit is in a different position. So, 444 would contribute to all three counts. So, that's fine.\n\nSimilarly, 488 has two 8's, but in the tens and units place. So, in my counts, each 8 is counted separately, which is correct.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Number of occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block which has 9 (480-488).\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (10+10+10+10+9).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Wait, 488 is less than 800, so the hundreds digit can't be 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Let me check: page numbers go up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total eights are units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Wait, but let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total eights are 98. Wait, is that correct? Let me recount the tens place. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 in tens place. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. So, now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 -98 =90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each step again. Counting fours: units, tens, hundreds. Units: 4,14,...,484. That's from 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is (484-4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks (40-49 is the first, then 140-149, etc., up to 440-449). So, 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, eights: units place:8,18,...,488. That's from 8 to 488, step 10. Number of terms: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks is 10 numbers, and the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, as the book ends at 488. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, difference:188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in numbers 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

The number of terms is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of terms} = \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n   So, there are 49 fours in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of fours} = 5 \\times 10 = 50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. The number of terms is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of terms} = 488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n   \\]\n\nAdding these together, the total number of 4's is:\n\\[\n49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in numbers 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10. The number of terms is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of terms} = \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges each contribute 10 numbers, and the last range contributes 9 numbers:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of eights} = 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.\n\nAdding these together, the total number of 8's is:\n\\[\n49 + 49 = 98\n\\]\n\n**Calculating the difference:**\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = 188 - 98 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. Let me recount the tens place for eights. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers. Then 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. For fours, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. Units place for fours: from 4,14,...484. The last number is 484, which is 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 484-4=480, 480/10=48, so n=49. Correct. Tens place for fours: 40-49,140-149, etc., each block of 100 has 10, and there are 5 blocks (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so does that affect the tens place? Wait, in the tens place, when we're looking at 40-49, that's within 0-99, so that's fine. Similarly, 140-149 is within 100-199, etc. So, each block contributes 10, and since there are 5 blocks (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488), but wait, 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit being 4 in 400-488 would be from 400-409, 410-419,... but wait, no, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, right? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the tens digit is 4 in any number where the second digit is 4, regardless of the hundreds digit. So, in 400-488, the tens digit can be 4 in 440-449, but that's only 10 numbers. So, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (440-449). So, in total, for the tens place, we have 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. That's correct. So, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total fours=188. For eights, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, total eights=98. So, 188-98=90.

So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - The last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights are units (49) + tens (49) = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.
