    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would suggest 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, that's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many full sets there are. From 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's four sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, the last set is 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 for each of these 9 numbers, adding 9 more eights. So total in the tens place is 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let's count how many full sets there are. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Then, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers). So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, which is 49. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10. That's 40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so total is 49.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So, let's count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 =9). Wait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers? Wait, 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488: that's 9 numbers.

So, zero eights here. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me double-check. Units:49, tens:49, so 98. That seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, so 98. 188-98=90.

For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for fours. When I was counting the tens place for fours, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50. That seems right. For eights in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four sets are 10 each, and the last set is 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. Units place for fours: 4,14,...,484. How many terms? From 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. For eights in units place: same logic, 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=49. Correct. Hundreds place for fours: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, and the last block has 9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book ends at 488, we have 480-488. Let's count each set. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480 is the first and 488 is the last, so that's 9 numbers. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 40+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to make an off-by-one error. Let's go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's to make sure.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, how many numbers?

From 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 sets (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449). Each set has 10, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488. The count is 488 - 400 +1 =89. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Units place: From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. (488 -8)/10 +1 =480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, 480-488 is the next set, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights:40+9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: Since the book ends at 488, there's no 800-899, so 0. Correct.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I just thought, in the tens place for 8's, when I count 80-89, that's 10 numbers, right? So, 4 sets would be 40, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nAnother check: Let's manually count the number of 4's and 8's in a smaller range to see if the method works. For example, pages 1-100.\n\nNumber of 4's in units place:10 (4,14,...,94). Tens place:10 (40-49). Hundreds place:0. Total:20.\n\nNumber of 8's in units place:10 (8,18,...,98). Tens place:10 (80-89). Hundreds place:0. Total:20.\n\nSo, difference is 0, which makes sense because 4 and 8 appear equally in 1-100. Wait, but according to our method, for 1-100, fours would be 20, eights 20, so same. But in our problem, up to 488, the fours are more because in the hundreds place, 400-488 adds more fours, while eights don't have that.\n\nWait, another point: When counting the hundreds place for 4's, we have 89 fours, which is correct because from 400 to 488 is 89 numbers. But for 8's, the hundreds place doesn't contribute anything because 800 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, the total fours are 188, eights are 98, difference is 90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Number of 4's:**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so that's 9 eights in the tens place for that last set. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. Yes, that's correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights =90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yep, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - There are 4 full blocks of 10 and one block of 9 (480-488).\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

From 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9.

The sequence is 8,18,...,488. The nth term is 8 + 10(n-1). Let me set 8 + 10(n-1) = 488. 10(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, units place: 49 eights.

Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), right? So, each full hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except maybe the last one. Let me count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers. Let me just quickly check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. Let me count each block. Each full block (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers, but the last block (480-488) has only 9. So, how many full blocks are there? From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's four blocks, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4*10=40.

For 480-488, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. So, yes, 4*10 +9=49 in the tens place. Units place: 49, as each 10 numbers have one 8, and 488 is included, so 488/10=48.8, so 49 times. So, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 8's: 98.\n\nSo, now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting.\n\nWait, when counting the 4's in the hundreds place, I had 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: 4,14,24,...,484. Let's see, 484 is the last one. How many numbers? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units place.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188 fours.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,28,...,488.

Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480-489 would be 10, but we only go up to 488, so it's 480,481,...,488, which is 9 numbers). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

    "text": " So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but including 488, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, 8,18,...,488. Let me count: from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place, so 488/10 = 48.8, so 49 times. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, so 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 40 eights in the tens place. But wait, does 480-489 also have an 8 in the tens place? But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, but only up to 488. Wait, 480-489 would be another set, but since the book stops at 488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's an additional 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets *10 =40, plus 9 more in 480-488, so 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, and the last set (480-488) has 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. So, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights, I subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours -98 eights =90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yep, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488), totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., plus the range 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"
