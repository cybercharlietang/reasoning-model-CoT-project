    "text": " So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but we have to include 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is in the units place as 8, so yes, that's the 49th time. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so that's 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so 98 total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit 8 occurs in 488. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 8,18,28,...,488. Let me calculate how many terms there are. The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d. Here, a_1=8, d=10, a_n=488. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 8: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, the first four blocks contribute 4*10=40, and the last block contributes 9. So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Let me recount the fours and eights. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.

It's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 380-389 is within range, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place would only go up to 488. Let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me make sure. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10=40, plus 9 is 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for fours. Wait, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right because 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours there. And in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, which is 10 times in each of the five hundred blocks: 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Units place: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 4,14,24,...,484. Let me see: from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in units place? The first is 4, then 14, 24,...,484. The last number is 484, which is 48*10 +4=484. So, how many terms? It's 484/10=48.4, but since we start at 4, which is the first term, the number of terms is 49. So, units place:49 fours. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. For eights, units place:8,18,28,...,488. 488 is the last one. So, 488 is 48*10 +8, so the number of terms is 49, as (488-8)/10 +1=49. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Let's see how many sets there are. From 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, right? So, that's correct. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the book. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such sets.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, each block before that has 10 numbers. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9.

But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8. So, each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count how many full blocks we have. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, that's 9, not 10. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights, so that's 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, total eights in tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place for eights. When I considered 480-488, I said there are 9 numbers. Let me list them: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place there. So, 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one block of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, that's correct. So, the total eights are 98. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about the hundreds place for fours, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. Similarly, for the tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers, which is correct. So, I think my counts are accurate.

The book ends at 488, so 480-488 is included. So, each of these blocks has 10 numbers. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus the 9 from 480-488.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct.

So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units (49), tens (50), hundreds (89). 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units (49), tens (49), hundreds (0). 49+49=98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for eights. Let me recount the eights in the tens place. From 1-400: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 40 eights. Then, from 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 +1 = 9 numbers. Each has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 40 +9=49. So, that's correct. Units place: 49 eights. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90 more fours. Yeah, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets do we have? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,28,...,488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? But our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, how many sets do we have? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9.

Hmm, but wait, did I count correctly? Let me go through each position again. Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, ((488-8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place is 49. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, that's 4*10 +9=49. So, yes, 49. So, total eights are 49+49=98.

Wait, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me check my counts again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount the fours: units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. Eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct. And for the tens place, 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Units place: every 10 numbers, 4 appears once, so from 4 to 484, that's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Wait, but 484 is the 49th occurrence because 4 is the first, then every 10. So, 4,14,...,484: that's 49 numbers. So, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total fours:188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total eights:98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for fours. Let me check: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50. That's correct.

So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full steps, but including 0, so 49 numbers. Wait, but 8 is the first, 18, 28,...488. Let me count: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10=40 and 9, so total 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights are units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n\nWait, let me just go through again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place had 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, seems correct. But wait, let me double-check the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. And for the tens place, 4 in the tens digit: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 5*10=50. That's correct. Units place for fours: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 4,14,...484. 484 is the 49th number. So, 49 fours in units place. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units place: 8,18,...488. That's 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set is only 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yep, that seems right. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This is 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me count how many numbers: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me list them: 8,18,28,...,488. So, starting from 8, each step is +10, so the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. But the book ends at 488, so 380-389 is okay, but 480-489 would include 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, let me think. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, the next block would be 480-489, but the book only goes up to 488, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, how many 8's? Each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) gives 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, the last block gives 9 eights. So total in tens place: 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, fours are 188, eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. Difference is 90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, let me check the tens place for fours again. I had 5 sets of 10 fours in the tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. That's correct. For eights in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, that's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49. That's correct. Units place for both digits: fours have 49, eights have 49. So, the difference comes from the hundreds place, where fours have 89 and eights have 0. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place, which is a significant contribution. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10.\n   - Number of terms: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Yes, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such blocks we have.

But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one more, and 488 is the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the book, so let's count how many sets. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits with 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, so 98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems right. But let me double-check the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. For eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. Units place for eights: 488 is included, so 49. Tens place: 49. So, total eights 98. So, 188-98=90.

Wait, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488).

So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, in the hundreds place for fours, I counted from 400-488 as 89 numbers. Let me confirm that: 488 - 400 +1 = 89. Yes, that's correct. For the tens place in fours, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Correct. For the tens place in eights, I had 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. Units place for both fours and eights: 49 each, which makes sense because in each digit place, the digits 0-9 appear roughly the same number of times, except possibly the last digit if the total number isn't a multiple of 10. Wait, but in the case of fours in the units place, 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. Same for eights: 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place for both is 49. So, the total fours are 188, eights are 98. So, 188-98=90.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be next, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let me count how many sets of 10 there are where the tens digit is 8. Each set is 10 numbers. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 -480 +1 =9). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place.

Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, that can't be right because 49+49=98, but I thought maybe I missed something. Let me double-check the tens place. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. Yes, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Counting fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. Counting eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the tens place, 40-49,140-149, etc., each gives 10 fours, and there are 5 such sets (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? Let's see, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 49 numbers. That's correct. So, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total fours:188. For eights, units:49, tens:49. Total eights:98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 count as an 8 in the units place? Yes, because the units digit is 8. So, starting from 8, 18, 28,...,488. How many terms are there? The first term is 8, which is 8 = 8*1, the next is 18=8*2+2? Wait, maybe a better way is to consider how many numbers from 1 to 488 have 8 in the units place. The number of such numbers is equal to the number of times 8 appears in the units place, which is every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, in the 488th page, the units digit is 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many 8's in the tens place? Let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: here, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488). So, in the tens place, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9. So total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8.

Hmm, so the answer should be 90. But wait, did I count correctly? Let me check the tens place for fours again. Tens place fours are in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

That's five sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. Units place for eights: 49, same as fours. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, yes, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.

The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 380-389 is okay, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. So, how many sets of 10 are there where the tens digit is 8? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights. So, 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, there are 89 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, I subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 89 (eights) = 99.

So, each block from 80-89, 180-189, etc., gives 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. The first block is 80-89: 10 numbers. Then 180-189: another 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (since 488-480+1=9). So, the first four blocks give 4*10=40, and the last block gives 9, so total eights in the tens place is 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are, I subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, not 10 because 489 is beyond 488). Wait, no. Wait, 480-489 is the next block, but since the book stops at 488, the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, in the tens place, 480-488 gives 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus the 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's 9 eights in the tens place, right? So, 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts because 90 seems a big difference, but maybe it's correct. Let me go through each digit position again for both fours and eights to ensure I didn't make a mistake. **Counting Fours:**\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. 488 - 400 +1 =89. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\n**Counting Eights:**\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n- Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.
