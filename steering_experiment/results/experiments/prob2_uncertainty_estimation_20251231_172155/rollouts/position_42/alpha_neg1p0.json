    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full decades. But 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8*1=8, 8*2=16, up to 8*49=392? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 488 is 8*61, but that's not the right approach. Let me think differently. The number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8*1=8, 8*2=16, ..., 8*49=392? Wait, no, that's not correct because 8*49 is 392, which is less than 488. Wait, actually, the number of 8's in the units place is the number of times 8 appears as the last digit, which is from 8,18,28,...,488. So, the first term is 8, the last term is 488, and the common difference is 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each block. Each hundred block (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me verify. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. That seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. Correct. 188 -98=90. Yeah, that seems right.

From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Each block of 10 has one 8, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, and then the 48th block ends at 480, so the next number is 488, which is another 8.

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. Wait, no, 488 is the 49th number because 8*1=8, 8*2=16, but wait, that's not right. Wait, each 10 numbers contribute one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10? Wait, no, 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th term in the sequence where each term is 8 more than the previous. Wait, 8*1=8, 8*2=16, but that's not right because 16 is 16, but in terms of units place, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, the number of 8s in the units place is the number of times 8 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488. So, for each 10 numbers, there's exactly one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. But wait, 488 is the last page, which is 488, so does that add an extra 8? Let me see: 488 is included, so from 1 to 488, the number of 8s in the units place is 48 +1? Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me think differently. The first 8 is at 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms are there? The nth term is 8 + 10*(n-1). We want 8 +10*(n-1) \u2264488. So, 10*(n-1) \u2264480, so n-1 \u226448, so n \u226449. So, there are 49 eights in the units place. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets do we have? Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). So, each of the first four sets contributes 10 eights in the tens place, and the last set contributes 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40+9=49 eights in the tens place. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, the sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. To find how many terms there are, we can use the formula: ((last - first) / step) + 1. Here, last is 488, first is 8, step is 10. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is within the 488 limit, so let's count each block. Each full block (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the hundreds digits go from 0 to 4. So, for each hundred, there's a block where the tens digit is 8. So, 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers), 100-199: 180-189 (10), 200-299:280-289 (10), 300-399:380-389 (10), and 400-488:480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, let's calculate each block. 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 eights in tens place. 100-199: 180-189 \u219210. 200-299:280-289\u219210. 300-399:380-389\u219210. 400-488:480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, that's 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49.

Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480 is included, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. Wait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block, which only has 9 because the book ends at 488. So, let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but the book only goes up to 488.

So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, each block from 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49.

For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yep, that looks correct.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Let me calculate how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Then, 480-488: since the tens digit is 8, but the hundreds digit is 4, and the units digit goes from 0 to 8. Wait, 480 is 480, and 488 is the last page. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, that's 9 eights. So total eights in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 40+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, tens place:49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yep, that's correct. So total eights are 49 +49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Yes, 480-488. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count them: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488).

    "text": " So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8 as the first, then 18 is the second, so 488 is the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? The number of terms in the sequence can be found by ((488 - 8)/10) + 1. Let's compute that: (480)/10=48, so 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10*4=40 plus 9 is 49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, I'm a bit confused about the hundreds place for fours. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, that's correct. And for the tens place, the fours go up to 440-449, which is 10 numbers, and that's within 488, so that's fine. For the eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, I think my calculations are accurate.

For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, seems correct. But wait, let me check the tens place for fours again. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 fours, so 50. Correct. And hundreds place for fours: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. For eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10, so 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Units place for eights: 488 is included, so 49. Correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This is 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, the number of 8's in the units place is (488 - 8)/10 + 1. Let's compute that: (488 - 8)=480, 480/10=48, so 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Checking fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. Checking eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.
