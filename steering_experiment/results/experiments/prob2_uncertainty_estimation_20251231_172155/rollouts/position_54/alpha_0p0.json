So, the difference would be 188 -98 =90. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the eights. Let me recount the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, units:49, tens:49, total 98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me check the hundreds place again. For fours, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, correct. For eights, the hundreds digit would be 8 only if the page numbers were 800-899, but since the book is only 488 pages, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. Also, for the tens place in fours, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Let me confirm that: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Correct. Units place for fours: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 4,14,...484. 484 is the 49th term because (484-4)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. Correct. So, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, total 98. So, 188-98=90.

So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This totals 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yep, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we'll count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{484}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\)\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, etc.  \n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences.  \n   - Total blocks with 4 in the tens place: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\)\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\)\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\)\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\)\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, etc.  \n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block which ends at 488.  \n   - Total blocks with 8 in the tens place: 5 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488).  \n   - Number of occurrences: \\( (4 \\times 10) + 9 = 49 \\)\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 0 \\)\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\)\n\n**Calculating the difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"
