Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't overcount somewhere. Let's re-examine the units place for fours. From 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place for fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each set is 10 numbers, 5 sets, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none. So, 49+49=98 eights. Therefore, 188 fours -98 eights=90 more fours. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units place:** The digit '4' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of '8's:**\n   - **Units place:** The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).
