    "text": " Units place is 49, tens place is 49, so total eights are 98? Hmm, but wait, when counting the tens place, from 80-89, that's 10, and similarly for each hundred, except the last one which is only 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, which is 4*10 +9=49. So, yes, 49 in tens place. Units place is 49, so total eights are 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, but let me cross-verify this because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours and eights separately. For fours: units place: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, 4 +10(n-1)=484 \u2192 10(n-1)=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? 8 + (n-1)*10=488 \u2192 (n-1)*10=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 5 blocks. First four blocks have 10 each, last block (480-488) has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. Hundreds place: none, as before. Total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, yes, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: \\( \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: \\( \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n- More 4's than 8's: \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " If in the tens place, each block contributes 10, except the last one which is 9 because it goes up to 488. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, which is 4*10 +9 =49. So, units and tens each have 49 eights, totaling 98. So, the number of 8's is 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98 =90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. From 400-488 inclusive, how many numbers? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the tens place, each hundred block has 10 fours, and there are five blocks (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, no, actually, up to 488, so the hundreds digits go up to 4. So, 0-99:40-49 is one set, 100-199:140-149, 200-299:240-249, 300-399:340-349, and 400-488:440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. That's correct. For the units place, from 4,14,...484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. So, 49 units fours, 50 tens fours, 89 hundreds fours, total 188.
