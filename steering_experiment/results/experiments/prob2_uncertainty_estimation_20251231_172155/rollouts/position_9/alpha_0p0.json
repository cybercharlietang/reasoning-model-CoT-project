How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra pages (481-488). So, in each of the 48 complete blocks, there's one 4 in the units place, which gives 48 times. Now, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. The digit 4 appears once here as well (484). So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for the tens digit, every block of 100 pages has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, from 00-99, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, in each 100-page block, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Now, how many complete 100-page blocks are there in 488 pages? There are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages left (401-488). Each of these 4 blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. In this range, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 pages (401-410). So, that's 10 more 4's. Therefore, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: For the hundreds digit, each digit from 1 to 4 appears in the hundreds place for 100 pages each. So, digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 499. But since our book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, meaning 89 occurrences of the digit 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: Units place (49) + Tens place (50) + Hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll use a similar approach, checking each digit position.\n\nStarting with the units place: Again, every block of 10 pages has one 8 in the units place. There are 48 complete blocks (1-480) and 8 extra pages (481-488). Each block contributes 1, so 48 times. In the extra 8 pages, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For the tens digit, each block of 100 pages has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, in each 100-page block, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. There are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), contributing 4 * 10 = 40. Now, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 80-89, which is 10 pages (480-489). But our book ends at 488, so from 480-488, which is 9 pages. Wait, no, actually, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 pages (480-488). So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages, giving 9 occurrences. Therefore, total 8's in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only from page 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, there are 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: Units place (49) + Tens place (49) + Hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 4's. For the 8's in the tens place, from 480-488, that's 9 pages, so 9 8's. Adding up, 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, the units place. For every 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and a partial set of 8 numbers (481-488). In each complete set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial set from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 through 8. So, does 4 appear here? Yes, at 484. So that's one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a range of 10 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, etc. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are up to 488. \n\nStarting from 40-49: that's one block, contributing 10 4's.\nThen 140-149: another block, another 10.\n240-249: another, 10.\n340-349: another, 10.\n440-449: another, 10.\nWait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is okay because 449 is less than 488. But after that, the next block would be 540-549, which is beyond 488, so we don't count that. So, how many blocks is that? From 40-49 up to 440-449, that's 5 blocks (each starting with 4, 14, 24, 34, 44). Each contributes 10 4's, so that's 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is fully included. Since the book goes up to 488, 449 is within that range, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 4's in the tens place, totaling 50. \n\nWait, but I'm thinking, does the last block go beyond 488? No, 449 is the last page in that block, and the next block would start at 540, which is beyond 488. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units place 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. Total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the partial set from 481 to 488 has units digits 1 through 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, total 8's in units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-489 would only go up to 488. Let's count how many such blocks there are.\n\nFirst block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 8's in the tens place.\nSecond block: 180-189: another 10.\nThird block: 280-289: another 10.\nFourth block: 380-389: another 10.\nFifth block: 480-488: this is a partial block. From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 for all these, so that's 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but I thought each block contributes 10, but the last one is only 9. So, let's see: how many full blocks are there? The first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) are complete, each contributing 10 8's. The fifth block is 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks give 4 * 10 = 40 8's, and the fifth block gives 9 8's, so total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. From 80-89: 10 numbers, yes. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. Then 480-488: 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. So, total 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems off because when I calculated 4's, I had 188, and 8's as 98, so the difference would be 90. But let me double-check my counts.\n\nWait, let me recount the 8's in the tens place. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus the last partial set (481-488) has 8 at 488, so 1 more, total 49.\n\nSo, 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98 8's.\n\nNow, 4's were 188, so 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when counting, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: from 1 to 488, how many 4's in units? Every 10 numbers, one 4. So, 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each with one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once at 484. So, total 49.\n\nTens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's five blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488: that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 +89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nUnits place: same as 4's, 48 full tens, each with one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), 8 appears at 488, so 1 more. Total 49.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, 49 +49=98.\n\nThus, 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a way to cross-verify this? Maybe by considering that up to 488, the number of 4's and 8's can be calculated differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a formula for digit counting.\n\nFor a given digit d and position (units, tens, hundreds), the count can be calculated as follows:\n\nLet me try to formalize this.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is:\n\nLet q = N // 10\nr = N % 10\n\nIf d < r, then count = (q +1) *1\nIf d == r, count = (q +1) *1\nIf d > r, count = q *1\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, for each complete set of 10, the digit d appears once in the units place. So, the number of complete sets is N // 10, which is q. So, the count is q *1. Then, if the remainder r >= d, we add 1 more. Wait, no, because in the units place, after q complete sets, the next numbers are from q*10 +1 to N. So, if the units digit is d, it's included if d <= r. Wait, actually, it's more precise to say:\n\ncount_units = q + (1 if d <= r else 0) if d !=0 else q\n\nWait, but for d=0, it's a bit different because 0 can't be in the units place for the first set (1-9). But in our case, d is 4 and 8, which are non-zero, so we can ignore that.\n\nSo, for units place:\n\ncount_units = q + (1 if d <= r else 0)\n\nWhere q = N //10, r = N %10.\n\nLet me apply this to d=4 and N=488.\n\nq = 488//10=48, r=8.\n\nSince 4 <=8, count_units=48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for d=8:\n\nq=48, r=8.\n\n8<=8, so count_units=48 +1=49.\n\nGood.\n\nNow, for tens place:\n\nThe formula is a bit more involved.\n\nThe count in the tens place can be calculated as:\n\ncount_tens = (N // 100) * 10 + min(max(d*10, (N % 100) +1), (d+1)*10) - d*10\n\nWait, maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, think of it as:\n\nThe number of times digit d appears in the tens place up to N is:\n\nLet higher = N // 100\ncurrent = (N // 10) % 10\nlower = N % 10\n\nIf current < d: count = higher *10\nIf current == d: count = higher *10 + lower +1\nIf current > d: count = (higher +1)*10\n\nBut wait, let me test this with d=4 and N=488.\n\nhigher = 488 //100 =4\ncurrent = (488//10) %10 =48 %10=8\nlower =488%10=8\n\nSince current=8 > d=4, so count= (4 +1)*10=5*10=50. Which matches our earlier count of 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8 in tens place:\n\nhigher=4, current=8, lower=8.\n\nSince current=8 ==d=8, so count= higher*10 + lower +1=4*10 +8 +1=40+9=49. Which matches our earlier count of 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, for hundreds place:\n\nFor d=4, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488. So, the count is (488 -400 +1)=89, as we calculated earlier.\n\nFor d=8, the hundreds digit would be 8 from 800-899, but since N=488 <800, count=0.\n\nSo, using this formula, our counts are consistent.\n\nThus, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did the hundreds place correctly for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAnd for 8's, since 800 is beyond 488, no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, yes, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{90}"

So, from 1 to 488, how many sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see, the first block is 40-49, which is within 1-99, the next is 140-149, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 1-488, so that's five blocks in total. So that's 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times for the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check again. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but that seems high. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place. Let me think again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? It's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times in the hundreds place. So, total 4's would be 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, in each set of ten numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, 48 times from the full sets, and in the last partial set, 8 appears once (in 488). So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-99, 80-89 is one block (10 numbers), then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So that's 5 blocks. Each full block contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times. So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9. So total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Then 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So total is 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full sets of 10 (each contributing 1) plus 1 in 484, 485, 486, 487, 488? Wait, no, in the units place from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once in 484. So, units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 4's. Then 140-149: another 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, 440-449: 10. Wait, that's five blocks, each contributing 10, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full sets of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus, in 481-488, the units digit 8 appears once (in 488). So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 8's. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, since we don't reach 800. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the tens place for 8's, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, each of these numbers has an 8, so that's 9 8's. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's. So, that seems right.\n\nI think my calculations are correct, so the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each set of ten numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) contains one '4' in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full sets of ten in 480 pages, contributing 48 '4's.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) include one more '4' in 484.\n   - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each block of ten numbers where the tens digit is '4' (e.g., 40-49, 140-149) contributes ten '4's.\n   - There are five such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total in tens place: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 each have a '4' in the hundreds place.\n   - This is 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - Total in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each set of ten numbers contains one '8' in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full sets, contributing 48 '8's.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) include one more '8' in 488.\n   - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each block of ten numbers where the tens digit is '8' (e.g., 80-89, 180-189) contributes ten '8's.\n   - There are four full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 '8's.\n   - The last block, 480-488, contributes 9 '8's in the tens place.\n   - Total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - There are no pages in the 800s, so no '8's in the hundreds place.\n   - Total in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of ten numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. Now, how many complete groups of ten are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups and a partial group from 481 to 488. So, in the units place, each of these 48 groups contributes one 4, so that's 48 times. Then, in the partial group (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, page 484 has a 4 in the units place. That's one more. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers. For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all ten pages. So, how many hundreds are there up to 488? There are four complete hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and then 400-488. Wait, that's actually five hundreds, but the last one isn't complete. Let me correct that. From 0-99 is the first hundred, then 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's five segments. In each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears exactly ten times. So that's 4 times 10 = 40. Now, in the last segment, 400-488, the tens digit is 0 for 400-409, 1 for 410-419, and so on up to 8 for 480-488. Wait, but the tens digit in 400-488 can go up to 8 in the tens place, right? So, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449, which is ten numbers. So, that's another 10. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the pages from 400 to 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 pages. So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: Units (49) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, in each group of ten, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, up to 488, how many complete groups of ten are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, the partial group from 481-488: the units digits go from 1 to 8, so page 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: In each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears in a block of ten numbers. For example, in 80-89, the tens digit is 8 for all ten pages. So, how many hundreds are there up to 488? Five segments as before. In each of the first four hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit 8 appears ten times each. So, that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last segment, 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is nine numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, let me check: 480-488 is nine numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, that's nine more 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. Therefore, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 complete groups (each contributing 1) + 1 in 481-488 = 49\n- Tens: 4 hundreds with 10 each = 40, plus 10 in 400-488 (440-449) = 50\n- Hundreds: 89 (400-488)\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 + 1 = 49\n- Tens: 4 hundreds with 10 each = 40, plus 9 in 400-488 (480-488) = 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as nine numbers, but let me count them: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's nine numbers, so nine 8's in the tens place in the last segment. So, that's correct.\n\nWait another thing: In the hundreds place for 4's, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place in 4's, in the last group (481-488), the units digit 4 occurs only once at 484. So that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct, and the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90. So, the final answer is \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, from 1 to 488, how many full groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 fours. But wait, the last group is from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers, so actually, the 48th group ends at 480, and then we have 481-488. So, does that mean there's an extra 4 in the units place at 484? Let me check: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Yes, 484 has a 4 in the units place. So, actually, the units place contributes 48 fours because 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the 48th group ends at 480, and then from 481-488, we have 8 more numbers, but the 484 is within that, adding one more 4. Wait, no, actually, when we count from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra in the incomplete decade. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, and then in the last partial group (481-488), we check if there's a 4 in the units place. 484 has a 4, so that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10 = 50 fours. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours from the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (400-488 inclusive), each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 fours.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full groups of 10 are there? 48 full groups (since 48*10=480), and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, the units place 8's: 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus in the last partial group, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except for the last one, which only goes up to 488, so 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, let me count:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, that's 4 full ranges of 10, contributing 4*10=40, plus 9 in the last partial range. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 4*10=40 plus 9=49. Yes, that seems right.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nTherefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. In the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8, right? So, numbers like 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, yes, that's correct. So, tens place 8's: 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4's. I said 50, which comes from 5 ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? So, 5 ranges * 10 = 50. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, we have 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and the partial 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. That's correct.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check that again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 188, and 8's are 98, so the difference is 90. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting the units place for 4's, I had 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4, and then in the last partial group (481-488), 484 has a 4, so that's one more, making it 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then in 488, the units digit is 8, so that's one more, making it 49. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 full groups of 10 in 488, contributing 48 fours. The last group (481-488) has one more 4 (at 484), so total units place 4's = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 fours. Total tens place 4's = 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place. There are 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Count the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full groups, contributing 48 eights. The last group (481-488) has one more 8 (at 488), so total units place 8's = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 eights. The last range (480-488) contributes 9 eights. Total tens place 8's = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place. For every ten numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in the range 1-10, the units digit is 4 once (page 4). Similarly, in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 complete sets of ten, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, the last set is 481-490, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, in the units place, how many 4's? Let me think. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place. Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, meaning 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times. But wait, in the last block, 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, does that affect the count? Actually, in the units place, every 10 numbers, the 4 occurs once, regardless of the higher digits. So from 1 to 488, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. So units place: 48.\n\nNow, moving to the tens place. In the tens place, a 4 appears in a block of ten numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes ten 4's in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see. The first block is 40-49, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks x 10 = 50. But wait, let me confirm. From 1-99, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, that's 10 numbers. Then from 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's five blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place: 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. In the hundreds place, a 4 appears from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many 4's in the hundreds place? It's the same as the number of pages from 400 to 488, which is 89. But wait, that seems high. Let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book ends at 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, the count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. For example, from 400 to 409, that's 10 numbers with 4 in the hundreds place. Similarly, 410-419, 420-429, etc., up to 480-488. So, how many hundreds blocks? From 400-499, but we only go up to 488. So, how many full hundreds? Let's see, 400-409: 10 numbers, 410-419: 10, 420-429: 10, 430-439:10, 440-449:10, 450-459:10, 460-469:10, 470-479:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. Wait, that's 9 blocks, but the first eight are 10 numbers each, and the last is 9. So total hundreds digits: 8 x 10 + 9 = 89. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: similar to 4's. For every 10 numbers, the units digit is 8 once. So, from 1 to 488, how many 8's in the units place? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Wait, but again, 488 is included, so does that affect? Let's see, the last number with 8 in units place is 488, which is included. So, yes, 48 times.\n\nTens place: similar to 4's. A 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. So, how many such blocks? Let's see. From 1-99: 80-89, that's one block. 100-199: 180-189, another block. 200-299: 280-289, another. 300-399: 380-389, another. And 400-488: 480-488. So, that's five blocks. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the last block contributes 9 8's (from 480-488). So, total tens place 8's: 4 x 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me confirm. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4 x 10 =40, plus 9 is 49. So, tens place: 49.\n\nHundreds place: Now, the hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 48 + 49 = 97.\n\nDifference: 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding how many more '4's are printed than '8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** For every 10 numbers, '4' appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades, contributing 48 '4's.\n   - **Tens Place:** '4' appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 '4's, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400 to 488, every number has a '4' in the hundreds place. This range includes 89 numbers, contributing 89 '4's.\n   - **Total '4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to '4's, '8' appears once every 10 numbers, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 5 blocks, but the last block (480-488) contributes only 9 '8's. Thus, 4 blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place within 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from '4's: 187 - 97 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 fours. But wait, the last partial set from 480 to 488 includes 484, which is another 4. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 fours in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 fours in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, up to 400, we have four blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, actually, from 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in each of these blocks. Let's count how many full hundreds we have. From 1 to 488, there are four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, there's a block of 10 where the tens digit is 4. That's four blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours are 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up: Units (49) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, for every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. That's 48 eights. But wait, in the last partial set (480-488), 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see: 80-89 is in 1-100, 180-189 in 101-200, 280-289 in 201-300, 380-389 in 301-400, and then 480-489 would be the next, but since the book ends at 488, only 480-488 is part of that. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, let me correct that.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, for the hundreds digit, 8 would appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book is only 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, no eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, back to the tens place: Each block of 100 numbers has one block where the tens digit is 8, contributing 10 eights. So, from 1-400, there are four such blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes 10 eights, so 4 * 10 = 40 eights. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: As I thought earlier, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights in total.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. For units place, I had 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and then an extra 8 in 488, making it 49. For tens place, in each 100 numbers, 10 eights, so four blocks give 40, and then in 400-488, 480-488 gives 9 more, totaling 49. So, 49 + 49 = 98 eights.\n\nWait, but when I added up the units and tens, I got 49 + 49 = 98. But earlier, for fours, I had 188. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both fours and eights.\n\nStarting with fours:\n\nUnits place: From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial set, 480-488, 484 is included, so that's one more 4, making it 49.\n\nTens place: In each hundred, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 fours in the tens place. So, that's five blocks, each contributing 10 fours. Wait, earlier I thought four blocks, but actually, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's the fifth block. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 fours, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours.\n\nSo, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow for eights:\n\nUnits place: Similar to fours, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial set, 480-488, 488 is included, so that's one more 8, making it 49.\n\nTens place: Each 100 numbers has one block where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 eights, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: Since the book doesn't reach 800, there are no eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for fours. I initially thought there were four blocks, but actually, it's five blocks because 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's the fifth block. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place, which adds up correctly to 188 fours.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the tens place, I had four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 eights, so 40, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49.\n\nWait, but in the 400-488 range, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 eights in the tens place for that partial block.\n\nSo, I think my counts are correct. Therefore, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98, so the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 4.\n   - Total sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full sets + 1 extra (484).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers have a block (e.g., 40-49) contributing 10 fours.\n   - Blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Total: 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages 400-488: 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 8.\n   - Total sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full sets + 1 extra (488).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers have a block (e.g., 80-89) contributing 10 eights.\n   - Blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389.\n   - Total: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Additionally, 480-488 contributes 9 eights.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. Now, how many such sets are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of ten and an extra 8 pages. So, in each of the 48 full sets, there's one 4 in the units place, which gives 48 times. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 is within this range, which adds another 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all ten numbers. Similarly, this happens in each hundred. So, from 1-99, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49). Then, from 100-199, it's another 10 times (140-149), and from 200-299, another 10 times (240-249). From 300-399, another 10 times (340-349). Now, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is another 10 times, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 more. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is entirely within 400-488. So, that's another 10. Let me add these up: 10 (40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449) = 50 times. But wait, I think I made a mistake here. From 400-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but does 440-449 fall entirely within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, total 4's in the tens place: 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, 89 times. \n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me check that again. Wait, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 times, correct. The tens digit: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is 10, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, and 440-449 is 10, so that's 50. Units digit: in each 10 numbers, one 4, so 48 full tens, plus one in the last 8 numbers, so 49. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, in each set of ten, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, up to 488, how many full tens are there? 48 full tens, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total units 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers each time it occurs. So, from 80-89, the tens digit is 8, that's 10 times. Similarly, in 180-189, another 10 times; 280-289, another 10; 380-389, another 10; and 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, how many times does 8 appear? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 times\n- 180-189: 10 times\n- 280-289: 10 times\n- 380-389: 10 times\n- 480-488: 9 times (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nSo, adding these up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, total tens place 8's: 49.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's:98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check my counting again because 188 - 98 is 90, but I'm not sure if I did the counts correctly.\n\nWait, for the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nFor the tens place, 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 10 each, so 50. That's correct.\n\nUnits place: 4's: each 10 numbers, 48 full sets (1-480), each contributing one 4 in units, so 48, plus in 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is there, which is one more 4. So, 49. That adds up to 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus in 481-488, 488 is the last page, so units digit 8 appears once, so 49.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, as the book doesn't reach 800.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nTherefore, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the tens place for 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but does 480-488 include 488? Yes, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, correct. So, 9 times the digit 8 in the tens place there.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? Because 480 has tens digit 8, 481 has tens digit 8, up to 488, which also has tens digit 8. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nWait, but wait another thing: When counting the units place for 4's, I considered 481-488, which includes 484, which adds one more 4 in the units place. But for 8's, in the units place, 481-488 includes 488, which adds one more 8 in the units place. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother check: Let's count the number of 4's and 8's in each position and sum them up.\n\n4's:\n\nUnits: 48 full tens (1-480) = 48, plus 484 in 481-488 = 1, total 49.\n\nTens: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449 = 5 sets of 10, so 50.\n\nHundreds: 400-488 = 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits: 48 full tens (1-480) = 48, plus 488 in 481-488 = 1, total 49.\n\nTens: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488 = 5 sets, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nHundreds: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** In each set of ten numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 full sets (1-480) contributing 48 fours. In 481-488, 484 adds one more, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, each contributing 10 fours, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears once per ten numbers. There are 48 full sets (1-480) contributing 48 eights. In 481-488, 488 adds one more, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four sets contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers reach 800, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., 44, etc. Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and an extra 8 numbers (481-488). In each complete set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8, so no 4 there. So, total 4's in the units place: 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each set of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many such sets are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an extra 88 numbers (401-488). In each of the 4 complete sets, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So that's 4*10 = 40 times. Now, in the extra 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is another 10 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so from 401-488, the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. \n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nUnits place: As before, for every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, in 488 pages, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, the extra 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so the digit 8 appears once more in 488. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100. So, in each set of 100, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, etc. Now, how many complete sets of 100 are there in 488? 4 complete sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). In each set, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times, so that's 4*10 = 40 times. Now, in the extra 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 times. Wait, but 480-488 is from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because I think I made a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. Let me double-check. For the tens place, in the extra 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 times. So, yes, 40 (from the four complete sets) + 9 = 49. So, total 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, I had 48 units 8's plus 1 in 488, making 49. Then 40 from the four sets and 9 from 480-488, making 49 in tens. So, total 49 + 49 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nSo, number of 4's is 187, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes I might have double-counted or missed something.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 times.\n\nTens place: 50 times.\n\nHundreds place: 89 times.\n\nTotal: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus the extra 8 in 488, making 49.\n\nTens place: 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 8's, so 40, plus the 9 in 480-488, making 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, for the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4); from 11-20, it appears once (page 14), and so on. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and then a partial set from 481 to 488. Each complete set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, the partial set from 481-488: let's see, page 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, for the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes ten 4's in the tens place. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 0-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks. Each block has ten 4's, so that's 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, the last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. Let's see, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nAdding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place: Similar to 4's, in every set of ten, 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488? As before, 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the partial set from 481-488: page 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is nine numbers, not ten. Let's see: each complete block before 480-488 contributes ten 8's. So, from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's four blocks, each contributing ten 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the block 480-488: the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so from 480 to 488, that's nine numbers (480,481,...,488), each with an 8 in the tens place, so that's nine 8's. So total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, zero 8's here.\n\nAdding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 complete sets of ten (1-480) contribute 48 fours. The partial set (481-488) adds 1 more, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** Five blocks (40-49, 140-149, etc.) each contribute 10 fours, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 contribute 89 fours.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 complete sets contribute 48 eights. The partial set adds 1 more, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** Four complete blocks (80-89, etc.) contribute 40 eights. The partial block (480-488) adds 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No eights appear here.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, for the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and an extra 8 numbers. In each of these 48 sets, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 10 numbers every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds and an extra 88 pages. Each complete hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has one block of 10 where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, totaling 40. Now, the extra 88 pages are from 401 to 488. In this range, the tens digit is 0 in 401-410, 1 in 411-420, and so on up to 8 in 481-490. Wait, but 488 is less than 490, so the tens digit goes up to 8 in 480-488. So, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 4's in the tens place. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me check that again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 = 88, so adding 1 gives 89 numbers. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me add up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Let me go through each place again: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once here (at 488). So, total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers every 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). Each complete block of 10 contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, how many complete blocks are there? From 1 to 488, the hundreds go up to 4. So, in each hundred, there's one block where the tens digit is 8. So, 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the last partial block, 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but there are only 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, total 8's in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 to 899. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, the hundreds place never has an 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, 187 4's and 98 8's. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 times. Because from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) don't include a 4 in the units place, so 48 units 4's.\n\nTens place: Let's see, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's every 100 numbers, starting at 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, that's five blocks, right? Wait, no, because 488 is less than 500. So, from 1-400, there are four blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349. Then, from 400-488, the next block would be 440-449, which is within 400-488. So, that's five blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50. So, that's 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\nUnits place: From 1-488, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place, so 48 full tens, contributing 48 8's. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place.\n\nTens place: From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's five blocks. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: As before, no 8's in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, but let me check again if I counted correctly in the tens place for 4's. I thought there were five blocks, but earlier I thought four blocks. Wait, from 1-400, there are four blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10 4's, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 400-488, the next block is 440-449, which is another 10 4's, so total 5 blocks, 5 * 10 = 50. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, five blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers, so 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nYes, I think the counts are correct. So, the final answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of ten numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of ten and then an extra 8 pages. In each of these 48 groups, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears ten times in every hundred numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in each hundred. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? That's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, from 401-410, the tens digit is 0, so no 4's there. From 411-420, it's 1, so again no 4's. Wait, actually, in the 400s, the tens digit 4 would be from 440-449, which is 10 times. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449). Therefore, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place here? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, but the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them. So, 89 times. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 499, but since the book ends at 488, it's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's using the same method.\n\nStarting with the units place: As before, in each group of ten, the units digit 8 appears once. So, in 488 pages, how many groups of ten? 48 full groups (each contributing one 8) and then 8 extra pages (481-488). In each group, one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the last 8 pages, the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears ten times in every hundred. So, 8 appears 10 times in each hundred. In the first four hundreds (1-400), that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 would be from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers: 480-488. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. Therefore, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never is 8. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 groups of ten (each contributing one 4) = 48, plus one more in 484, total 49.\n- Tens: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's = 40, plus 10 in 440-449, total 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 groups of ten = 48, plus one in 488, total 49.\n- Tens: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 8's = 40, plus 9 in 480-488, total 49.\n- Hundreds: 0, as the book doesn't reach 800.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 times, correct. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nAnd for 4's in the tens place, from 401-488, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 times, correct.\n\nYes, I think the calculations are accurate. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - There are 48 full groups of ten (480 pages) and 8 additional pages (481-488).\n   - 48 groups \u00d7 1 = 48, plus 1 in 484 \u2192 Total: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In every hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149).\n   - There are 4 full hundreds (400 pages), contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - In 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449 \u2192 10 times.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - 48 groups \u00d7 1 = 48, plus 1 in 488 \u2192 Total: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In every hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - 4 full hundreds contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - In 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488 \u2192 9 times.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit 8 doesn't appear since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, for the units place: In every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. Since the book has 488 pages, let's see how many complete blocks of 10 there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers. In each complete block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), I need to check if there's a 4 in the units place. The numbers are 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 484 has a 4 in the units place, adding one more. So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, for the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a block of 10 numbers every 100 numbers. For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. In each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each (e.g., 40-49 in 1-100). So that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449. That's another 10 numbers. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, that's correct. So, 40 from the complete hundreds and 10 from the partial, totaling 50.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, again, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then, in the last partial block, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for a block of 10 numbers every 100 numbers. For example, in 80-89, the tens digit is 8. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88, so 4 complete hundreds. In each of these, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89 in each hundred). So, 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in all these, so that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the tens place. So, 9 more. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488. So, 480 has tens digit 8, as does 481, up to 488. That's 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers). So, 9 8's in the tens place in the last partial hundred. So, total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when counting the 4's, I got 188, and for 8's, 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me go through the 8's again. Units place: 488 / 10 = 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last partial block is 481-488, which has 8 numbers: 481 to 488. The units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, only 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more, making units place 49. That's correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 8's in the tens place (e.g., 80-89). So, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488. That's 9 numbers, as 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers. So, 9 more, totaling 49 in the tens place. So, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nFor the 4's: Units place: 48 full blocks, each with one 4, so 48. Last partial block, 481-488: units digit 4 is in 484, so one more, total 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds contribute 40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, totaling 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 4's.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. Maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, in the tens place for 8's, I had 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. But in the hundreds place, for 4's, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers, correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: For the 4's, in the hundreds place, it's 89, which is correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nFor the 8's, in the hundreds place, none, since the book ends at 488, so no 800s.\n\nWait, but let me think about the 8's in the tens place again. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488. So, 480, 481, ..., 488: that's 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, 40 from the hundreds and 9 from the partial, totaling 49 in the tens place for 8's.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. So, 40 from the hundreds and 10 from the partial, totaling 50.\n\nSo, 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 4.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full blocks, contributing 48 \u00d7 1 = 48.\n   - The last partial block (481-488) has 484, adding 1.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers contribute 10 4's (e.g., 40-49).\n   - 488 \u00f7 100 = 4 full blocks, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - The last partial block (401-488) includes 440-449, adding 10.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Numbers 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 8.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full blocks, contributing 48 \u00d7 1 = 48.\n   - The last partial block (481-488) has 488, adding 1.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers contribute 10 8's (e.g., 80-89).\n   - 488 \u00f7 100 = 4 full blocks, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - The last partial block (401-488) includes 480-488, adding 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, the units place. For every set of ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each set of ten, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place there. So, total 4's in units place: 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all ten numbers. Similarly, in 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 440-449. So, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, in each hundred, there's one block of ten where the tens digit is 4. So that's five hundreds, but wait, from 0-99 is the first hundred, then 100-199, etc., up to 400-488. So, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? Let's see: \n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 in the tens place.\n- 140-149: another 10.\n- 240-249: another 10.\n- 340-349: another 10.\n- 440-449: another 10.\n\nSo that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, so 5\u00d710=50. But wait, in the last block, 440-449, does that fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, total 50 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers? Well, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So yes, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4, in every set of ten numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten? 48 complete sets (480 numbers) and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each set, 8 appears once in the units place, so 48 times. In the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in the units place (number 488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100, specifically in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n- 180-189: another 10.\n- 280-289: another 10.\n- 380-389: another 10.\n- 480-488: how many numbers? From 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9). So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. The highest page number is 488, so the hundreds digit can only be 0,1,2,3,4. So, no page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, 49 + 49 is 98. So, total 8's: 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so 98 in total.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 in units place, and the last partial set doesn't have a 4 in units place).\n- Tens: 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, etc.), each 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\nTotal: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus the last partial set (481-488) has 8 in units place (488), so 49.\n- Tens: 5 blocks, each 10, except the last one which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 10\u00d74 +9=49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again, maybe I missed something. For example, in the tens place for 8's, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times 8 in the tens place, right? So, 4 blocks of 10 and one of 9, totaling 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, the last block is 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times, making 5 blocks of 10, totaling 50. Correct.\n\nAnd for hundreds place, 4's are from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nAnd for 8's, hundreds place is 0. Correct.\n\nSo, yeah, 187 - 98 = 89. So, the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one '4' in the units place.  \n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 480 pages, contributing 48 '4's.  \n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) do not add any more '4's in the units place.  \n   - **Total in units place:** 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - Every 100 numbers have a block of 10 where the tens digit is '4' (e.g., 40-49, 140-149).  \n   - There are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).  \n   - Each block contributes 10 '4's, except the last block (440-449) which is fully within 488.  \n   - **Total in tens place:** 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - The hundreds digit is '4' from page 400 to 488.  \n   - This is 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1).  \n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89.\n\n**Total number of '4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Similar to '4's, every 10 numbers contribute one '8' in the units place.  \n   - 48 complete sets of 10 contribute 48 '8's.  \n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) include page 488, adding one more '8'.  \n   - **Total in units place:** 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - Every 100 numbers have a block of 10 where the tens digit is '8' (e.g., 80-89, 180-189).  \n   - There are 5 such blocks, but the last block (480-488) only has 9 numbers.  \n   - **Total in tens place:** (4 blocks \u00d7 10) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - No page numbers have '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n**Total number of '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n187 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = **89**.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once. How many such sets are there from 1 to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 more numbers. In each full set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, 484 is one of them, which contributes another 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many hundreds do we have? From 1-488, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). Wait, no, actually, 488 is less than 500, so it's 4 full hundreds and then 88 pages. But the tens digit in the hundreds place works differently. Let me think. Each hundred block contributes 10 times the digit 4 in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would contribute 4 * 10 = 40 times. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490. Wait, but 488 is less than 490, so the tens digit goes up to 8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. How many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Only once, in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? 440 is in that range, so that's another 10 occurrences. Wait, but 440 is in 401-488, so that's 10 more. So, total tens place 4's would be 40 (from the four hundreds) plus 10 (from 401-488) = 50. But wait, 401-488 is 88 numbers, which is 8 full tens (401-410, 411-420, ..., 481-490), but 490 is beyond 488, so the last tens is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, up to 8 for 481-488. So, 4 appears in the tens place in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 more. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's are 188.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, in each set of ten, the units digit 8 appears once. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of ten and 8 extra numbers. So, 48 times in the units place. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: For the tens digit, in each hundred block, the tens digit is 8 for 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, 10 occurrences. From 1-488, we have 4 full hundreds and then 88 more pages. So, 4 hundreds contribute 4 * 10 = 40 times. In the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nFor the 4's:\n\n- Units place: From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units digit? Every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\n- Tens place: For each hundred, 10 times. 4 hundreds (1-400) contribute 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. Total 50. That seems correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units place: Similarly, 48 full sets of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), units digit 8 appears once (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred contributes 10 times, so 4 hundreds give 40. In the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 9 more. Total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: No 8's, as the book ends at 488. So, 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for the 8's. Let me check again. In the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences. That's correct. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's in the tens place, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. That's correct.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Every 10 numbers contribute 1 occurrence of 4.  \n   - Total full sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 sets.  \n   - Remaining numbers (481-488): 1 occurrence (484).  \n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences (e.g., 40-49).  \n   - Four full hundreds (1-400): 4 * 10 = 40.  \n   - Last partial hundred (401-488): 10 occurrences (440-449).  \n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - Pages 400-488: 89 occurrences.  \n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Every 10 numbers contribute 1 occurrence of 8.  \n   - Total full sets of 10: 48.  \n   - Remaining numbers (481-488): 1 occurrence (488).  \n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences (e.g., 80-89).  \n   - Four full hundreds: 4 * 10 = 40.  \n   - Last partial hundred (401-488): 9 occurrences (480-488).  \n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of ten consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears once at page 4; in 11-20, it appears once at page 14; and so on. Now, I need to figure out how many such groups there are up to page 488. From page 1 to 488, that's 488 pages. So, the number of complete groups of ten is 488 divided by 10, which is 48 groups, with 8 pages remaining (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8). In each of these 48 groups, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, I need to check the remaining 8 pages (481-488). In these, the units digit goes from 1 to 8. The digit 4 appears once at page 484. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in the range 40-49, which is 10 times. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Now, up to page 488, there are four complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages in the 400's. Wait, no, actually, 400-488 is 89 pages, but let me check: 488 - 400 +1 = 89 pages. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the 400's, the tens digit is 0-8. So, in pages 400-488, the tens digit is 0 for 400-409, 1 for 410-419, and so on up to 8 for 480-488. The digit 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, that's another 10 times. Therefore, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages. Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. \n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through each place again: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: As before, in each group of ten, 8 appears once. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of ten (480 pages) and 8 remaining pages. So, 48 times in the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears once at page 488. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place.\n\nTens place: In each hundred, the tens digit is 8 in the range 80-89, which is 10 times. So, for each hundred, that's 10 times. Up to page 488, there are four complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40. Now, in the 400's, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's pages 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the 400's. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting, 188 - 98 equals 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many complete sets of ten are there from 1 to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 occurrences. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the 48th set would end at 480, and then we have 481 to 488. So, in the units place, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the next 4 in the units place would be 484, which is within this range. So actually, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place because 480 is the 48th set, and 484 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, because 480 is the 48th set, but 484 is within the 481-490 range, so actually, that's the 49th occurrence. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place can be calculated by considering how many times 4 occurs in each ten's place. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each ten's place, 4 appears once in the units. The number of complete tens is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8). So, 48 times, plus one more in the incomplete set (481-488, where 484 is the 4). So, total 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but actually, 488 is the last page. So, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of times 4 is in the units digit. Let me calculate it as follows: The number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of complete sets of ten, which is 48, plus one if the last number is 484 or beyond. Since 484 is within 481-488, that adds one more, making it 49. So, units place: 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for every set of 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges exist up to 488. The first is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50 occurrences. But wait, 440-449 is within 1-488, so that's fine. So, tens place: 50 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for the numbers 400-488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). Wait, no, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. But in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but actually, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. Starting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, the digit 8 appears once every ten numbers in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, and then in the incomplete set (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included. So, in the incomplete set, the units digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units place: 48 +1=49 times.\n\nNow, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that range. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences except the last one, which contributes only 9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, let's count: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 times.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. Yes.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4 and 8.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49 (as 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4, plus one more in 484)\n- Tens: 50 (five ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449, each contributing 10)\n- Hundreds: 89 (400-488, which is 89 numbers)\nTotal: 49+50+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49 (48 complete sets, plus 488)\n- Tens: 49 (four complete ranges of 10, each contributing 10, and the last range 480-488 contributing 9)\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49+49=98\n\nDifference: 188-98=90\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 occurrences, plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets, plus one in 488, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book doesn't reach 800.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

How many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 extra pages. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times from the full sets, plus one more time in the last partial set (pages 481-488), specifically at page 484. So, units place gives me 49 fours.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a block of ten pages, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, from 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, which means there are 4 full hundreds and then 88 pages. In each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears exactly once, covering 10 pages each time. So, 4 times 10 is 40 fours from the full hundreds. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (from 400 to 488), the tens digit is 4 only in the pages 440-449. That's another 10 fours. So, adding that, the tens place gives me 40 + 10 = 50 fours.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all pages from 400 to 488. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. But wait, actually, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. \n\nWait, let me check that. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 = 88, so 88 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, in each set of ten pages, the digit 8 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning 48 full sets and 8 extra pages. So, units place gives 48 eights from the full sets. Now, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digit is 8 at page 488. So, that's one more. So, units place gives 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full hundreds. Each hundred contributes one block of ten with 8 in the tens place, so 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 eights. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (400-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, that's 9 pages: 480-488. Wait, but the tens digit is 8 for all these, so that's 9 eights. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, contributing 9 eights. So, tens place gives 40 + 9 = 49 eights.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights in total.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. For the tens place, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 9 eights in the tens place for that partial hundred. So, 4 full hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - In every set of ten pages (e.g., 1-10, 11-20), the digit 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full sets of ten (480 pages) and 8 additional pages (481-488).\n   - Full sets: 48 \u00d7 1 = 48 fours.\n   - Additional pages: Page 484 contributes 1 more four.\n   - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive pages (e.g., 40-49, 140-149).\n   - Each hundred contains one such set, contributing 10 fours.\n   - There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 fours.\n   - In the remaining 88 pages (400-488), the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, contributing another 10 fours.\n   - Total in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all pages from 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n   - Total in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, each set of ten pages contributes 1 eight.\n   - 48 full sets contribute 48 eights.\n   - Page 488 adds 1 more eight.\n   - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive pages (e.g., 80-89, 180-189).\n   - Each hundred contributes one such set, totaling 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights.\n   - In the remaining 88 pages (400-488), the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 pages.\n   - Total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - There are no pages where the hundreds digit is 8, so 0 eights.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in every block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, 4, 14, 24, etc. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, there are 48 full blocks and then an extra 8 pages. Each of these 48 blocks contributes one 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 fours. But wait, in the extra 8 pages (from 481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once more (at 484). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for the tens digit, every 100 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for example, from 0-99, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (40-49). Similarly, from 100-199, it's another 10 times (140-149), and so on. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in the tens place. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so another 10 fours. Wait, but 488 is only up to 488, so 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So, that's another 10 fours. So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, 400 to 488 inclusive is 89 numbers, but the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but 400 to 488 is 89 pages, so 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. 400 is the first page with hundreds digit 4, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because in the hundreds place, each page from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up the hundreds, tens, and units places for 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 50 (tens) + 49 (units) = 188 fours. Hmm, but wait, let me check that again. Wait, when I counted the tens place, I had 40 from the first four hundreds and 10 from 401-488, totaling 50. Units place was 49. Hundreds place was 89. So 89 + 50 + 49 = 188 fours.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, how many full blocks of 10 are there in 488? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once more at 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For the tens digit, every 100 numbers, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, from 0-99, the tens digit is 8 ten times (80-89). Similarly, from 100-199, another 10 times (180-189), and so on. Now, how many full hundreds are there in 488? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). So, each of these contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40 eights. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place here? From 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 eights in the tens place here. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but hold on, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 eights. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Units: 49, tens: 49, so total 98 eights.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place was 49 and the tens was 49, so 98. Now, for 4's, I had 188. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for 4's. Let me go back to that.\n\nWhen I counted the tens place for 4's, I considered that in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, for 1-100, 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. Similarly, 101-200, 140-149 is another 10, and so on up to 301-400, 340-349, another 10. So that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours in the tens place from the first four hundreds.\n\nThen, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10 fours. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, so yes, 10 fours. So, that part is correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 49, as calculated before.\n\nHundreds place: 89 fours.\n\nSo, 89 + 50 + 49 = 188 fours.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nTens place: 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, 9 eights in the tens place. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is entirely included. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again for 4's. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once more at 484. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, same calculation: 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights, and in the remaining 8 numbers, 8 appears once at 488, so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for 8's, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I'm counting correctly in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 fours. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400 is the first page with hundreds digit 4, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: in the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages, so 89 fours.\n\nSo, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 50 (tens) + 49 (units) = 188.\n\nAnd all the 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be 90, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to consider each digit position separately for both 4 and 8, and then sum them up.\n\nLet me try that again:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: floor(488 / 10) = 48, plus if the remainder is >=4, add 1. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: floor(488 / 100) = 4, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 488 - 400 = 88, so floor(88 / 10) = 8, but we need to see how many times 4 appears in the tens place in 401-488. Since 440-449 is within 401-488, that's 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: floor(488 / 1000) = 0, but since 488 >= 400, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: floor(488 / 10) = 48, plus if remainder >=8, add 1. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: floor(488 / 100) = 4, so 4 * 10 = 40. In the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: floor(488 / 1000) = 0, and since 488 < 800, hundreds digit is never 8, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, from 1 to 488, how many such groups are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full group, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 is in this range, which adds another 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for every group of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). How many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, from 1 to 400, there are 4 full hundreds. In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 0-8. So, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 times. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding all these up: Units (49) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nUnits place: For every group of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, as before, there are 48 full groups of 10 and 8 extra numbers. So, 48 times for the full groups, and in the extra numbers (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. That adds another 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For every group of 100 numbers, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). From 1 to 400, there are 4 full hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 times in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 0-8. So, in the 400s, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, that's 9 times. Therefore, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 onwards, but since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding these up: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10 (480 instances) plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. From 1 to 400, that's 40 instances. From 400 to 488, 440-449 adds another 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears 89 times from 400 to 488.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, that's 48 instances plus one in 488, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. From 1 to 400, that's 40 instances. From 400 to 488, 480-488 adds 9 more, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives me 48 fours. But wait, after 480, there are 8 more numbers (481-488), so in the units place, 481-488 would have a 4 in 484, right? So that's one more 4. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many times this happens. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the following ranges: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So 5 x 10 = 50 fours. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nAdding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, for every set of ten numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of ten, each contributing one 8. So, 48 eights. Now, in the incomplete set from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more 8. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but 480-489 would go up to 489, but our book ends at 488. So, in the range 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many sets do we have? Let's see: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 5 sets, but the last one has only 9 numbers. So, the number of 8's in the tens place is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Each of the first four sets (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 sets x 10 = 40. The fifth set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, the hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because when I counted the units place, I got 49, and the tens place also 49, so total 98 eights. But let me double-check the tens place. For 80-89, that's 10 eights. 180-189 is another 10, so 20. 280-289: 30. 380-389: 40. Then 480-488: 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct. So, total 49 in tens, 49 in units, so 98 eights.\n\nWait, but when I counted the units place, I had 48 sets of ten, each contributing one 8, and then one more in 488, making 49. That's correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: 0, since we don't reach 800.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier when I counted the 4's, I got 188, and 8's as 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me go through that again.\n\nFor the units place of 4's: From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 48 complete sets (1-480), each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, from 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included, which is one more 4. So, total 49 fours in units place. That's correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. That's correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So, total 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nNow, for the 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 sets of ten, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, 488 has an 8, so 49 total. Correct.\n\nTens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 0. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check that again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. That's correct.\n\nWait, but when I counted the 8's in the tens place, I included 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, another thought: When counting the units place for 4's, I included 484, which is correct. Similarly, for 8's, I included 488, which is correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nBut wait, let me just make sure I didn't double-count any numbers or miss any ranges. Let me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full decades (1-480) plus 484, so 49.\n\nTens place: 5 decades where the tens digit is 4, each contributing 10 numbers, so 50.\n\nHundreds place: 89 numbers (400-488), so 89.\n\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full decades plus 488, so 49.\n\nTens place: 5 decades (80-89, etc.) but the last one only has 9 numbers, so 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Well, from 1 to 480, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 480 divided by 10 is 48. That means 4 appears 48 times in the units place. But wait, from 1 to 480, it's actually 480 numbers, so 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, the last page is 488, which is beyond 480, so I need to check from 481 to 488. In this range, the units digits are 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again in the units place. So, total 4's in units place: 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times. Then from 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10 times, and so on. So, let's calculate how many times 4 appears in the tens place. From 1-400, how many hundreds? 400 divided by 100 is 4, so 4 sets. Each set contributes 10 times, so 4*10=40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8, so the tens digit 4 appears again from 440-449, which is another 10 times. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so from 400-488, the tens digit cycles as 0-8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from 1-400) +10=50.\n\nWait, but actually, from 1-400, each hundred has a 4 in the tens place for 10 numbers, so 4 hundreds would have 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10, making it 50. So, total 4's in tens place:50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times. So, total 4's in hundreds place:89.\n\nAdding them up: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total 4's=48+50+89=187.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. Hmm, seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: For every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many full tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens. Each contributes one 8, so 48 times. Now, check from 481-488: units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once more. So total 8's in units place:48+1=49.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's see. Each hundred has a block where the tens digit is 8, which is 10 numbers. So, from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers where tens digit is 8. So, 4*10=40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times. Therefore, total 8's in tens place:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding them up: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total 8's=49+49=98.\n\nWait, let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, so 98. Correct.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, total 4's=187, total 8's=98. The difference is 187-98=89.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me go through the calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place: From 1-488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4. But wait, 48*10=480, so up to 480, that's 48 times. Then, from 481-488, the units digit goes from 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear again. So, units place:48.\n\nTens place: From 1-400, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place:40+10=50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's:48+50+89=187. Correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nUnits place: From 1-488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, 488/10=48.8, so 48 full sets, contributing 48 eights. Then, from 481-488, the units digit is 8 once (at 488). So, total units place:48+1=49.\n\nTens place: From 1-400, each hundred has a block where the tens digit is 8, which is 10 numbers. So, 4*10=40. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: Since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:187-98=89.\n\nHmm, so the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me think again. Is there a possibility I double-counted or missed something? For example, in the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right. For the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Wait, earlier I thought 4 sets from 1-400, but actually, from 1-400, it's 400 numbers, so 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, it's another 10 in 440-449, making it 50. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, in the tens place, from 1-400, it's 4*10=40, and from 401-488, it's 9 in 480-488, making 49. So that's correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 187-98=89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places across all page numbers.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10, contributing 48 fours.\n   - From 481 to 488, 4 does not appear in the units place.\n   - **Total in units place:** 48.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).\n   - From 1 to 400, there are 4 sets of 100, contributing 40 fours.\n   - From 401 to 488, 4 appears in 440-449, contributing another 10 fours.\n   - **Total in tens place:** 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10, contributing 48 eights.\n   - From 481 to 488, 8 appears once (at 488).\n   - **Total in units place:** 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89).\n   - From 1 to 400, there are 4 sets of 100, contributing 40 eights.\n   - From 401 to 488, 8 appears in 480-488, contributing 9 eights.\n   - **Total in tens place:** 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is never 8 since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14; and so on. So, I can calculate how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488 pages and then multiply by 1 to get the number of 4's in the units place. \n\nWait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. Each complete set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So, total 4's in units place: 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for every 100 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for pages 40-49, which is 10 times. So, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds and then 88 extra pages. Each complete hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 times 10, which is 40. Now, for the extra 88 pages (100-188), wait, no, actually, the hundreds go up to 400, right? So, after 400, the tens digit cycles again. Let me think again. From 1-400, there are four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these has 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, up to 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears from 481-488, which is 8 pages. Wait, but I'm looking for 4's in the tens place. In 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, 2 for 421-430, 3 for 431-440, 4 for 441-450, 5 for 451-460, 6 for 461-470, 7 for 471-480, and 8 for 481-488. So, in the range 441-450, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 pages (441-450). But wait, 450 is included, so that's 10 numbers. So, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages. So, adding that to the previous 40, total 4's in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but earlier I thought from 1-400, it's 40, and from 401-488, it's another 10, so total 50. But wait, 401-488 is 88 pages, which is 0.88 of a hundred. So, the tens digit cycles 0-9 every 10 pages. So, in 88 pages, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? Well, in each 100, it's 10 times, so in 88 pages, it's 8 full tens (80 pages) plus 8 pages. So, in 80 pages, the tens digit 4 would appear once, from 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488? Wait, 440 is 440, which is within 401-488, so that's 10 pages. So, yes, 10 times. So, total 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400-488. So, how many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, meaning 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's. I need to count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, in every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits from 1-8, so 8 appears once in the units place (page 488). So, total 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place: For every 100 numbers, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, similar to 4's, in each 100, there are 10 8's in the tens place. From 1-400, there are four hundreds, each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles again. Let's see, in 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). So, in the range 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in the pages 480-488. Wait, but 480 is 480, and 488 is the last page. So, how many pages have 8 in the tens place? From 480-488, that's 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but 480 is included, so that's 9 pages. So, in the tens place, from 401-488, 8 appears 9 times. So, total 4's in the tens place would be 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49. Wait, but earlier for 4's, it was 50. Hmm, let me check again. For 8's in the tens place: From 1-400, it's 40. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, total 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only for pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 187, total 8's: 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 8's in the units place. From 1-488, every 10 pages, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 times, and then in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit 8 is at 488, so one more, making it 49. That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 4's. That's correct.\n\nWait, but when I calculated 4's in the tens place, I had 50, and 8's in the tens place as 49. So, 50 vs 49. Hmm, that seems correct because in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 pages, but the tens digit 8 appears only up to 488, which is 9 pages (480-488). So, that's why 4's in tens place are 50, and 8's are 49.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check again the 4's in the tens place. From 1-400, it's 4*10=40. From 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 40 +10=50. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: 40 from 1-400, and 9 from 401-488, so 49. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 89.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488 pages, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) do not include a 4 in the units place.\n   - **Total in units place:** 48.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - For every 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - From 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, contributing 40 occurrences.\n   - From 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 pages.\n   - **Total in tens place:** 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all pages from 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488 pages, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) include an 8 at 488.\n   - **Total in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - For every 100 numbers, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - From 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, contributing 40 occurrences.\n   - From 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages.\n   - **Total in tens place:** 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at page 488.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **89**.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10 and a partial group of 8. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times from the full groups and once more in the partial group (484), totaling 49 times.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of 100 numbers, specifically from 40 to 49. Each of these 10 numbers has a 4 in the tens place, so that's 10 times. Additionally, this block occurs in each hundred. So, from 1-100, 10 times; 101-200, another 10 times; 201-300, another 10; 301-400, another 10; and 401-488, another 10. Wait, but 401-488 is only 88 numbers, but the tens place 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 times again. So, in total, the tens place has 10 times for each hundred, and there are 4 hundreds in 400, but since we go up to 488, that's 5 times 10, so 50 times. Wait, no, actually, from 1-400, there are four blocks of 100, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens place 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10 times. So, total for tens place is 50 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers, but each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, inclusive. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought each group of 100 contributes 10 times in the tens place, but actually, for the hundreds place, it's 89 times. So, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places for the digit 4:\n\nUnits: 49\nTens: 50\nHundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of 10, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full groups of 10 are there? 48 full groups (since 48*10=480) and a partial group of 8 (481-488). So, in the units place, 8 appears 48 times from the full groups and once more in the partial group (488), totaling 49 times.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for an entire block of 100 numbers, specifically from 80 to 89. Each of these 10 numbers has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 10 times. This occurs in each hundred block. So, from 1-100, 10 times; 101-200, another 10; 201-300, another 10; 301-400, another 10; and 401-488, another 10. Wait, but 401-488 includes 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, from 401-488, it's 9 times, not 10. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (from 1-400) and 9 in the last partial block, so 4*10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, no, let me think again. From 1-100: 10 times (80-89)\n101-200: 10 times (180-189)\n201-300: 10 times (280-289)\n301-400: 10 times (380-389)\n401-488: The tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, that's 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0 times.\n\nSo, total 8's: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 98 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place 8's were 49, but let me check that again. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, how many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 49th term because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 times. So, units place 8's: 49.\n\nTens place: As above, 49 times.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: From 1-488, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. The number of such occurrences is floor(488/10) = 48, plus if the last number is >= (48*10 +4), which is 484, so yes, 484 is included, so 48 +1 =49.\n\nTens place: For each hundred block, 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each block contributes 10 times. How many such blocks are there? From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10 times. So, total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nUnits place: Same as above, 49 times.\n\nTens place: From 1-400, each hundred block has 10 times (80-89, etc.), so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, how many numbers is that? 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers, so that's 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place of 4's, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nI think the counts are accurate. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times. That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place of 8's, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 4 blocks of 10 in the tens place for 8's, totaling 40, plus 9, so 49.\n\nI think I'm confident with these numbers. So, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, how many sets of 10 are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets and then 8 more numbers. Each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit is 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear again. So, units place gives me 48 fours.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Let me see how many hundreds are there. From 1 to 488, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488). Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 1-400, that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40 fours. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8, so 4 doesn't appear in the tens place again. So, tens place gives me 40 fours.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for 100 consecutive numbers, from 400-499. But since the book ends at 488, it's from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up: Units (48) + Tens (40) + Hundreds (89) = 48 + 40 = 88, plus 89 is 177. So, total 4's are 177.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many full sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1-8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total units place eights are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let's check each hundred. From 1-100: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. From 101-200: 180-189, another 10. From 201-300: 280-289, another 10. From 301-400: 380-389, another 10. Now, from 401-488: the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, in each of the first four hundreds, we have 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40. Then, in the last partial hundred, we have 9 eights. So, total tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nAdding them up: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 177 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 79. So, there are 79 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (once every 10 numbers, 488/10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets).\n- **Tens place:** 40 occurrences (10 per hundred, 4 hundreds).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (from 400-488, 89 numbers).\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 40 + 89 = 177.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (48 full sets of 10, plus one in 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (10 per hundred for the first four hundreds, plus 9 in 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 177 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 79.\n\n\\boxed{79}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place from 1 to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last group is 480-488. In that group, 484 is included, which is another 4 in the units place. So, actually, it's 49 times in the units place. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 times because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, when we get to 484, that's the 48th occurrence. So, maybe it's 48 times. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The nth term can be found by 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, 4 + 10(n-1) = 484 => 10(n-1) = 480 => n-1 = 48 => n=49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. So, I think the correct count is 49. Because 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 times.\n\nNext, the tens place. For the tens place, 4 appears in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, each number has a 4 in the tens place, so that's 10 times. Similarly, from 140-149, another 10 times, and so on. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. Wait, but 488 is beyond 449, so the next block would be 440-449, but 488 is beyond that. So, how many complete blocks are there? Let's calculate how many hundreds fit into 488. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500). Wait, but 488 is within 401-500, so up to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see:\n\n- 40-49: 10 times\n- 140-149:10\n- 240-249:10\n- 340-349:10\n- 440-449:10\n\nSo, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 times, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 1-488, so yes, that's included. So, the tens place has 50 occurrences of 4.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place: How many times does 8 appear in the units place from 1 to 488? For every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. But wait, let's check: the last number is 488, which ends with 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 times.\n\nTens place: 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488. So, how many blocks? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 times\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 times (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488-480+1=9)\n\nWait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but each has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 times.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units: 49, tens:49, so total 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units was 49 and tens was 49, so 98 total 8's. Now, the number of 4's was 188, so the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49 (from 4,14,...484)\n- Tens place: 50 (from 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449)\n- Hundreds place: 89 (from 400-488)\nTotal: 49+50+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49 (from 8,18,...488)\n- Tens place: 49 (from 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488)\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused about the tens place for 8's. Let me recount that. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, we have 5 blocks: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. That's correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other digits. For example, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, but 8 never appears there because the book ends at 488. So, that's correct.\n\nI think that's the right approach. So, the final answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149).\n   - There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 occurrences.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - There are 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189).\n   - There are 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 occurrences.\n   - The last block is 480-488, contributing 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = **49**.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. In the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the 4 in the units place appears once more. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, in every block of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. How many such blocks are there? Since the book goes up to 488, we have four blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. Wait, actually, each hundred block is 100 numbers, so from 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. So, the first four blocks are complete, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. That's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the last partial block is 401-488. In this block, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the pages 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, every block of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, 48 full blocks (488 / 10 = 48.8) give 48 8's. The last partial block, 481-488, includes 8 in the units place once (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: In each block of 100 numbers, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are four full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the last partial block is 401-488. In this block, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The 8 in the tens place occurs in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's here.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total.\n\nNow, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 full blocks (1-480) give 48 4's, and 484 is in the last 8 pages (481-488), so +1, total 49. That seems right.\n\n- Tens: Each 100 block has 10 4's in the tens place. 4 blocks (1-400) give 40, and 440-449 in 401-488 adds 10, so 50 total. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 full blocks (1-480) give 48 8's, and 488 adds 1, so 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens: Each 100 block has 10 8's in the tens place. 4 blocks give 40, and in 401-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. Total 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: None, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 pages. So, in each of the 48 full blocks, there's one 4 in the units place, giving 48 fours. But wait, in the last partial block (pages 481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once in the units place here as well (page 484). So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for every 100 numbers, the digit in the tens place cycles from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. Now, how many full hundreds are there in 488 pages? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then the last partial hundred is 401-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. But wait, 488 is less than 500, so 401-488 includes 440-449. So, that's another 10 fours in the tens place. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nSo, total number of 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach.\n\nStarting with the units place: As before, in each block of 10, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, 48 full blocks give 48 eights, and the last partial block (481-488) includes page 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place: For every 100 numbers, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, in the first four hundreds (1-400), that's 4 * 10 = 40 eights. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full tens + 1 in the last 8 pages = 49\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in 440-449 = 50\n- Hundreds: 89 (from 400-488)\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full tens + 1 in the last 8 pages (488) = 49\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 9 in 480-488 = 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nYes, that seems correct.

    "text": " \n\nFirst, the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. How many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 complete sets of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each complete set, the 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the extra numbers from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once more in the units place here (484). So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each full hundred, the 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 x 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. The 4 appears in the tens place from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10 times. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. Just like with 4's, every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, so that's 48 times. In the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so the digit 8 appears once in the units place (488). So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. Similar to the 4's, in each hundred, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 80-89. There are 4 full hundreds, so 4 x 10 = 40 times. In the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes up to 8. So, the 8's in the tens place occur from 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. But wait, 480-488 includes 480, 481, ..., 488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. For the tens place of 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, but actually, 480 is included, so from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). So, that's correct, 9 times. So, 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49. That seems right.\n\nWait, but when I calculated the 4's in the tens place, I had 4 full hundreds giving 40, and then in 401-488, I considered 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's in tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place, I had 40 + 9 = 49. So, total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. 4's are 188. So, 188 - 98 = 90. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again for 8's. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last partial set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. Here, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total 48 +1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in units place, it's the same logic: 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, and then in 481-488, 484 has a 4 in the units place, so 48 +1 =49. Correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place, 4's appear from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's in hundreds place, since the book ends at 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nSo, adding up: 4's are 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds) =188. 8's are 49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once. There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 484, adding 1 more.\n   - **Total in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In each hundred, 40-49 contributes 10 occurrences. With 4 full hundreds, this is 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - The last partial hundred (401-488) includes 440-449, adding another 10.\n   - **Total in tens place:** 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, totaling 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers contribute one 8. With 48 complete sets, this is 48 occurrences.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, adding 1 more.\n   - **Total in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In each hundred, 80-89 contributes 10 occurrences. With 4 full hundreds, this is 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - The last partial hundred (401-488) includes 480-488, which is 9 occurrences.\n   - **Total in tens place:** 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers reach 800, so no 8's here.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place. For every set of ten pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 full sets of ten, and then 8 extra pages (481-488). In each full set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so no 4's there. So, total 4's in the units place: 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all ten numbers. Similarly, in 140-149, 240-249, etc. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see. The first occurrence is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, 140-149, another 10, and so on. Since the book goes up to 488, the last occurrence would be 440-449, which is another 10. Let me count how many such sets there are. From 0-488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. But when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can only go up to 8, because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, the tens digit cycles regardless of the hundreds digit, but in the hundreds place, we have to be careful not to exceed 488. So, for the tens digit being 4, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. But when hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can only go up to 8, because 488 is the last page. So, how many full sets of 100 are there? Well, 488 is less than 500, so we have 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), and then 400-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each. So that's 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is another 10 times. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 +10=50.\n\nWait, but hold on, 400-488 is 89 pages, right? So, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 pages, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the pages 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages, so each of these 89 pages has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400-488 is 89 pages because 488-400+1=89. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4's, in each set of ten pages, the units digit 8 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many sets of ten are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so one 8 in the units place (page 488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 +1=49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit 8 appears in sets like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 pages, right? Because 480-488 is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, let's see. For each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place, except possibly in the last hundred. So, from 0-488, the hundreds digits are 0,1,2,3,4. So, for hundreds 0,1,2,3, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times each. For hundreds 4, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, number of 8's in tens place: 4*10=40, plus 9=49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 pages. From 100-199: 180-189 is another 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is 10. From 400-488: 480-488 is 9 pages. So, total 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nWait, so total 4's are 187, and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48+50=98; 98+89=187.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 187-98=89.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me check the tens place for 4's again. I had 4's in the tens place as 50. Let me recount that.\n\nFor the tens digit 4, the pages are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, each of these is 10 pages, so 5 sets of 10, which would be 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's correct. So, 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's, so 50. That seems right.\n\nFor the units digit 4's: 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48. Plus, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit doesn't reach 4 again, so no additional 4's. So, 48.\n\nFor the hundreds digit 4's: 400-488 is 89 pages, each contributing one 4, so 89.\n\nSo, 48+50+89=187.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\nUnits digit: 49. Because 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus page 488, which is an extra 8, so 49.\n\nTens digit: 49. Because 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four contributes 10, and the last contributes 9, so 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds digit: 0, as 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, 49+49=98.\n\nThus, 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the units digit for 4's, I considered 48 full sets, but the last page is 488, so the units digits go up to 8. So, in the last partial set, the units digits are 1-8, so no 4's, which is correct. So, 48 units 4's.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens digit 4's, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct.\n\nWait, another thought: when counting the units digit 8's, I included page 488, which is correct because its units digit is 8. So, 49 units 8's.\n\nI think my counts are accurate. So, the difference is 89.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I miscounted the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, yes, 89.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{89}."

How many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, there are 48 complete sets of 10. Each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 fours. But wait, the last set would be from 480 to 488, which is only 9 numbers, but 484 is still within that range, so actually, there are 49 fours in the units place because 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, but since 484 is the 48th multiple plus 4, I think it's 49. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. Let me calculate it as 488 divided by 10, which is 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours, and then check if the remaining 8 pages (481-488) include a 4 in the units place. 484 is in there, so that's one more, making it 49 fours in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a block of 10 numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: the first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), the next is 140-149, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 fours, so 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nAdding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) include 488, which has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more, making it 49 eights in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is a partial block because it's only 9 numbers. Let's count each block: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, that's 4 full blocks (each contributing 10 eights) and one partial block. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 eights from 480-488, but wait, in the tens place, each number in 480-488 has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the hundreds place with 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I thought the units place had 49 and the tens place had 49, but let me double-check the tens place. When I was counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so that's 4 x 10 = 40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 more, totaling 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I count the units place for 8's, I got 49, and the tens place also 49, making 98. Let me check the units place again. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. Then, the last partial set is 481-488, which includes 488, so that's one more 8 in the units place, making it 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, total fours were 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the counting for fours and eights because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units place: 49 (as calculated)\n- Tens place: 50 (from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449, which is 5 blocks of 10, so 5 x 10 = 50)\n- Hundreds place: 89 (from 400-488, which is 89 numbers)\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, in each set of ten, there's one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 times 1, which is 48. But wait, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit cycles from 1 to 8. So, does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, 484 is within 481-488, so that's another 4. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: For the tens digit, the 4 appears in a block of ten numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes ten 4's in the tens place. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: the first block is 40-49 (that's 10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's five blocks in total. Each block gives ten 4's in the tens place, so 5 x 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nAdding up the 4's: Units (49) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, for every ten numbers, the units digit is 8 once. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of ten and an extra 8 numbers. So, 48 times 1 is 48. In the last partial set (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included, which adds another 8. So, units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count the blocks. Starting from 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (another 10), 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five blocks, but the last one has only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers). So, each of the first four blocks contributes ten 8's in the tens place, and the last block contributes nine 8's. So, that's 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's are 0.\n\nAdding up the 8's: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counting, especially for the tens place in 8's. I thought there were five blocks, but actually, from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five blocks, but the first four are complete, each with ten 8's, and the last one has nine. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, I had five blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is ten numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. That's correct.\n\nAnd for hundreds place, 4's go up to 488, so 89 numbers, each contributing a 4. So, 89 is correct.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 188, and 8's are 98. The difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). Each complete block contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, page 484 has a 4 in the units place. That adds one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a block of 10 numbers.

But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. But let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, and so on up to 440-449. That's five blocks, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 488 is beyond 449, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, 49 in units, 50 in tens, 89 in hundreds. So, 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but that seems correct because in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct. So, total 4's are 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, every block of 10 has one 8 in the units place. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are in 488? As before, 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the partial block is 481-488, which has units digits 1-8. So, page 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last partial block. Each full block (80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's see how many full blocks there are. From 80-89: that's one, 180-189: another, 280-289: another, 380-389: another. So, four full blocks, each contributing 10 8's: 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the partial block is 480-488. How many numbers are there? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the tens place, all these numbers have an 8, so that's 9 more 8's. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to miscount.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 complete blocks (1-480) each contributing 1, so 48, plus in 481-488, page 484 adds 1, total 49.\n- Tens: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 4's, so 5*10=50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in hundreds place, so 89.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 complete blocks (1-480) each contributing 1, so 48, plus in 481-488, page 488 adds 1, total 49.\n- Tens: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in tens place, so 9. Total 40+9=49.\n- Hundreds: 0, as before.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. From 40-49, that's 10 numbers, each with 4 in tens place. Similarly, 140-149, etc. Up to 440-449. That's five blocks, each with 10, so 50. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, that's five blocks, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so 4 full blocks and one partial. So, 4*10=40, plus 9, so 49. That seems right.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** Every block of 10 numbers contributes one '4'. There are 48 complete blocks (1-480), contributing 48 '4's. The partial block (481-488) adds one more (484), totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** Each block of 100 numbers has a '4' in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). There are five such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), contributing 5\u00d710=50 '4's.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** Numbers 400-488 contribute 89 '4's in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to '4's, there are 48 complete blocks (1-480), contributing 48 '8's. The partial block (481-488) adds one more (488), totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** Each block of 100 numbers has an '8' in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89). There are four complete blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), contributing 4\u00d710=40 '8's. The partial block (480-488) adds 9 more, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No '8's appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of ten, which is 48 full groups (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups). But wait, each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so in the 48th group, which is 480-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 484 is included, so yes, 48 times. \n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for every group of 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these groups contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such groups are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five groups. But wait, the last group, 440-449, is within 488, so that's valid. So, each group gives 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 groups \u00d7 10 = 50 times. \n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 4's. \n\nAdding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, every group of ten has an 8 in the units place. So, from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? Again, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so in the 48th group (480-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included. So, that's 48 times.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in groups like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each group contributes 10 8's in the tens place. How many such groups are there? Let's see: 80-89 is the first, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four groups. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 380-389 is included, but 480-489 isn't because the book ends at 488. So, the last group would be 380-389, which is valid. So, 4 groups \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding them up: units (48) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 40 = 88. So, the digit 8 appears 88 times.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 88 (8's) = 99. \n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 5 groups \u00d7 10 = 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 4 groups \u00d7 10 = 40\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 48 + 40 = 88. That also seems correct.\n\nSubtracting: 187 - 88 = 99. So, there are 99 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full groups of ten (1-480), so 48 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each of the following decades: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 groups \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each of the following decades: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 groups \u00d7 10 = 40 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 48 + 40 = 88.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 88 (8's) = 99.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{99}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 pages, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive pages, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, it's page 4; 11-20, it's page 14; and so on. Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and a partial set of 8 pages (481-488). In each complete set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial set from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, it does. So that's one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 in the tens place occurs in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, each page has a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 times. Similarly, in the next hundred, 140-149, another 10 times, and so on. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred from 401-488. \n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (like 40-49). So, 4 complete hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The 4 in the tens place would be from 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So, that's another 10 pages where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 10 more. Therefore, total 4's in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 in the hundreds place occurs from page 400 to 488. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, total 4's in the hundreds place is 89.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours printed.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place. Similar to the 4's, in each set of 10 pages, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. From 1-488, there are 48 complete sets of 10 and a partial set of 8 pages. So, 48 times in the units place. In the partial set 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so page 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block has 10 pages with 8 in the tens place. How many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). So, 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the partial hundred 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so from 480-488, that's 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 in the hundreds place would occur from page 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights printed.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus the partial set where 484 adds one more, so 49.\n- Tens: 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Plus the partial hundred where 440-449 is 10 pages, so 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 complete sets, 48, plus 488 adding one more, so 49.\n- Tens: 4 complete hundreds, 40, plus 480-488 being 9 pages, so 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSubtracting: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the logic or calculations.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4. There are 48 complete blocks (480 pages) and a partial block of 8 pages (481-488). The partial block includes 484, adding one more 4. Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n- **Tens place:** Each hundred contributes 10 4's (e.g., 40-49). There are 4 complete hundreds and a partial hundred (401-488) which includes 440-449, adding 10 more. Total: 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, totaling 89 pages. Total: 89.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** Similar to 4's, each block of 10 contributes one 8.

So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such groups are there from 1 to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of ten and a partial group of 8 numbers (481-488). In each full group, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the partial group (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the digit in the tens place cycles every 100 numbers. For each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? From 1-488, there are four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds go up to 400, and then 401-488 is another 88 numbers. So, in each hundred block (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, four hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 4's in the tens place. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 4's. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding all these up: Units place (49) + Tens place (50) + Hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's printed is 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again.\n\nStarting with the units place: As before, in each group of ten, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of ten and a partial group of 8 numbers (481-488). So, 48 times in the units place, plus once in the partial group (488), totaling 49 8's in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 in the tens place appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Each full block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five blocks. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480-488), so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, contributing 9 8's. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding these up: Units place (49) + Tens place (49) + Hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's printed is 98.\n\nFinally, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** In each group of ten (e.g., 1-10, 11-20), 4 appears once. There are 48 full groups (1-480) and one partial group (481-488). Thus, 48 + 1 = 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** In each hundred, 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). There are four full hundreds (1-400) and one partial hundred (401-488). Thus, 4*10 + 10 = 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, contributing 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears once in each group of ten. There are 48 full groups and one partial group, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** In each hundred, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89). There are five blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488). The first four contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let's count the 4's in the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many such blocks are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each of the 48 full blocks, there's one 4 in the units place, totaling 48. But wait, in the last partial block (481-488), do we have a 4 in the units place? Yes, 484. So that's one more. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the 4's in the tens place. Similarly, in every block of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 40-49, each number has a 4 in the tens place. So, how many full hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). Each full hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), how many 4's are in the tens place? From 401-410, the tens digit is 0, so no 4's. From 411-420, the tens digit is 1, no 4's. Wait, actually, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, 2 for 421-430, 3 for 431-440, and 4 for 441-450. Wait, but 441-450 is within 401-488, so from 441-450, the tens digit is 4. That's 10 numbers, so 10 more 4's. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from the full hundreds) + 10 (from the partial hundred) = 50.\n\nWait, hold on, let me double-check that. From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 441-450, which is 10 numbers. So yes, that's 10. So total is 50.\n\nNow, the 4's in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-499. But since our book only goes up to 488, it's 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but actually, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place. Again, for every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full blocks of 10 are there? 48 full blocks (1-480) and then 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each full block, one 8, so 48. In the last partial block (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 is present once (488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the 8's in the tens place. In every block of 100 numbers, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place, specifically in the 80-89 range. So, for each full hundred, that's 10 8's. We have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but our book stops at 488. So, 480-488: the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but in the tens place, each number from 480-488 has an 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the tens place. So, 9 more 8's. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me think again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488. So, that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the 8's in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's there.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For the units place, 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in 481-488, units digit 8 is at 488, so that's one more. So, 49 total. For the tens place, in each full hundred, 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 480-488, which is 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 40+9=49. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place was 49 and tens place was 49, so 98 total. So, now, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full tens (1-480) contribute 48 4's. Then, 484 is in 481-488, so one more. Total 49.\n- Tens place: Each hundred has 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, 40+10=50.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full tens (1-480) contribute 48 8's. Then, 488 is in 481-488, so one more. Total 49.\n- Tens place: Each hundred has 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more. So, 40+9=49.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's there.\n\nFor 8's, hundreds place: none, since the book ends at 488, which is less than 800.\n\nSo, yes, the calculations seem correct. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 full decades (1-480) contributing 48 4's. In 481-488, 484 adds one more, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** In each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Four full hundreds contribute 40. In 401-488, 440-449 adds 10 more, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place, totaling 89.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** For every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. There are 48 full decades contributing 48 8's. In 481-488, 488 adds one more, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** In each hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. Four full hundreds contribute 40. In 401-488, 480-488 adds 9 more, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's appear in the hundreds place.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: In the range 1-488, every 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, for every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. How many complete groups of 10 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. So, in each group of 10, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so there's one more 4 (at 484). So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For every 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). How many complete hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 times 10 is 40. Now, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 in the tens place. So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (440-449), but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488? Let me check: 440 is 400 + 40, so yes, 440-449 is part of 401-488. So, that's another 10. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nAdding up the 4's: Units place (49) + Tens place (50) + Hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so there's one more 8 (at 488). So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For the tens digit, 8 appears in every block of 100 numbers, specifically in the range x80-x89, where x is the hundreds digit. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's see. For each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.), the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 full hundreds in 400, so 4 times 10 is 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, 9 occurrences. Therefore, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never is 8. Therefore, 0 occurrences.\n\nAdding up the 8's: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's list them:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers\n\nSo, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. That matches what I had before. So, 49 in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: From 1-488, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place, so 48 times for the full groups, plus one more at 488, making 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting, especially with the hundreds place. For 4's, the hundreds place was 89, right? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. \n\nWait, but when I was counting the 4's in the tens place, I thought that in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 10 = 50. That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, in the tens place, the last partial hundred is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 in tens, 49 in units, total 98.\n\nSo, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly for the hundreds place. For 4's, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's, the hundreds place never comes into play because the book only goes up to 488, so hundreds digit 8 doesn't occur. So, 0.\n\nAnother way to think about it: Let's consider each digit place separately.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 488 // 10 = 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, plus the remainder 8 includes 484, so 49.\n- Tens: 488 // 100 = 4 full groups, each contributing 10 4's, so 40, plus the remainder 88, which includes 440-449, contributing 10, so total 50.\n- Hundreds: 488 // 1000 = 0, but since the hundreds digit can be 4, from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 488 // 10 = 48 full groups, 48 eights, plus the remainder includes 488, so 49.\n- Tens: 488 // 100 = 4 full groups, each contributing 10 eights, so 40, plus the remainder 88, which includes 480-488, contributing 9 eights, so total 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full groups, contributing 48 fours.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 484, adding 1 more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - 488 \u00f7 100 = 4 full groups, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 fours.\n   - The remaining 88 numbers (401-488) include 440-449, adding 10.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full groups, contributing 48 eights.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, adding 1 more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - 488 \u00f7 100 = 4 full groups, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights.\n   - The remaining 88 numbers (401-488) include 480-488, adding 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4); from 11-20, it appears once (page 14), and so on. Since the book has 488 pages, the number of complete groups of ten is 48 (because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups). Therefore, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times. But wait, I think I might have gone too far. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490) but since the book ends at 488, the last group is only up to 488. So, actually, the number of full decades is 48, and the remaining pages are 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, in the units place, 4 appears once every 10 pages, so 48 times from the full decades, and then in the remaining pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 would have a 4 in the units place. So that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The total number of units digits is 488, so the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of times 4 is in the units digit from 1 to 488. This can be calculated as floor(488/10) = 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus if the last partial cycle has a 4 in the units place. The last page is 488, so the units digit is 8, so no extra 4. So total units place 4's: 48.\n\nWait, but wait, 488/10 is 48.8, so floor(488/10) = 48, so 48 times 4 appears in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, how many hundreds are there in 488? That's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages left (401-488). So, in each of the 4 full hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4*10=40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. The tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so that's another 10. So total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50.\n\nWait, but wait, 401-488 is 88 pages, which is 4 full decades (400-409, 410-419, etc.) up to 480-488. Wait, no, 401-488 is 88 pages, which is 8 full decades (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-489) but since we stop at 488, the last decade is 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? It appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So yes, 10 more in the tens place. So total tens place 4's: 4*10 +10=50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nWait, but wait, 400-488 is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: How many times does 8 appear in the units digit from 1 to 488? It's similar to the 4's. Each 10 pages, 8 appears once. So, floor(488/10)=48 full cycles, so 48 times. Then, check the last partial cycle: 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once more. So total units place 8's:48+1=49.\n\nTens place: How many times does 8 appear in the tens digit? Each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for 4 full hundreds (1-400), that's 4*10=40. Now, the remaining pages are 401-488. The tens digit in this range goes up to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 times. So total tens place 8's:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's:0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nWait, so 4's are 187 and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 187-98=89 seems correct, but I might have made a mistake in counting the 4's or 8's.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 488/10=48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48. The last partial cycle is 481-488, which doesn't include a 4 in the units place, so units 4's=48.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, 10 times. 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10. So, 40+10=50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's:48+50+89=187.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48. The last partial cycle, 481-488, includes 488, which has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more, making units 8's=49.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:187-98=89.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. From 1-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 sets. Each of the first four sets (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last set, 480-488, has 9 numbers, so 9. So, total tens place 8's:40+9=49, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's in the tens place, it's 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers except the last one, which is within 401-488. Wait, 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, 4*10=40 from the first four hundreds, plus 10 from 440-449, totaling 50. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"how many more 4's are printed than 8's.\" So, if 4's are 187 and 8's are 98, then 187-98=89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the answer might be 89, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 there.\n\nSo, yes, the final answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - For every 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - Number of complete groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n   - Thus, 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - For every 100 pages, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).\n   - Number of complete groups of 100 in 488 pages: 4 (since 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.88).\n   - Thus, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 occurrences.\n   - In the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n   - Thus, 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - For every 10 pages, the digit 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - Number of complete groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48.\n   - Thus, 48 occurrences.\n   - In the last partial group (481-488), the digit 8 appears once (page 488).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - For every 100 pages, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89).\n   - Number of complete groups of 100 in 488 pages: 4.\n   - Thus, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 occurrences.\n   - In the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, which is beyond the book's range.\n   - Thus, 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many such blocks are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks and a partial block of 8 pages. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times, plus one more time in the 484th page, making it 49 times. Wait, no, actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so the last block ends at 488, but the units digit 4 would occur at 484, which is within the 480-488 range. So, yes, 48 full blocks give 48 fours, and the last partial block (481-488) includes 484, which is another 4. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for every block of 100 pages, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, from 1 to 488, how many hundreds are there? 488 is less than 500, so we have four full hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and then 400-488. Wait, actually, 488 is in the 400-488 range, which is part of the fifth hundred block but only up to 488. So, each full hundred (0-99, 100-199, etc.) has 10 fours in the tens place. So, for four full hundreds (0-399), that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for the pages 440-449. That's another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 488 is less than 500, so does the 400-488 block include all the tens fours? Yes, because 440-449 is entirely within 400-488, so that's 10 fours. So, total tens fours: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. That's 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these 89 pages, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but 488 - 400 + 1 = 89, right? Because 488 - 400 is 88, plus 1 is 89. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with units place: For every block of 10 pages, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full blocks of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, the partial block from 481-488 includes 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For every block of 100 pages, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, from 1 to 488, how many full hundreds? Four full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for each of those, so that's 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 pages: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, yes, 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0.\n\nSo, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, for fours, I got 188, and for eights, 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place. In the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 eights. So, that's correct. So, total tens eights: 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 9 = 49. Units eights: 49, so total eights: 98.\n\nWait, but let me check the fours again. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems right.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** For every 10 pages, '4' appears once. There are 48 full decades (1-480) and 8 extra pages (481-488). Each decade contributes 1 '4' in the units place, totaling 48. The last partial decade (481-488) includes 484, adding 1 more '4'. Total units place '4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** For every 100 pages, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). There are four full centuries (1-400), each contributing 10 '4's, totaling 40. The 400-488 range includes 440-449, adding 10 more '4's. Total tens place '4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** Pages 400-488 have '4' in the hundreds place, totaling 89 pages. Thus, 89 '4's.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to '4', '8' appears once every 10 pages. With 48 full decades and the last 8 pages, total units place '8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** For every 100 pages, '8' appears 10 times in the tens place. Four full centuries contribute 40 '8's. The 400-488 range includes 480-488, adding 9 '8's. Total tens place '8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No '8's appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488. Total hundreds place '8's: 0.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."
