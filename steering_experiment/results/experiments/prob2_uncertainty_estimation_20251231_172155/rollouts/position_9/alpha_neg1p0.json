    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, from 1-10, the 4 is in 4; from 11-20, it's in 14, and so on. Now, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and an extra 8 numbers. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times. But wait, I should check the last partial block. From 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear there. So, units place contributes 48 times.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for the tens digit, every block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place for each 100 numbers. Now, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 times 4 in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Then, we have the partial hundred from 401-488. In this range, the tens digit goes from 0 (401) to 8 (488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? It would be from 440-449, which is 10 times. So, adding that, the tens place contributes 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is only relevant for three-digit numbers, which start from 100. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. That's 89 numbers (400-488 inclusive). So, 89 times. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. But the hundreds digit is only the first digit, so each of those numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Wait, let me check: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds place contributes 89 times. \n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. \n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4, every block of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. The last partial block is 481-488, where the units digit is 8 in 488. So, that's one more. So, units place contributes 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nTens place: For the tens digit, every block of 100 has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for each 100 numbers, 10 times 8 in the tens place. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-400), so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, the partial hundred from 401-488: the tens digit cycles from 0 (401) to 8 (488). So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place here? It would be from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480 is part of 401-488, so the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times. So, total tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never is 8. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** In each block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. With 48 complete blocks (480 numbers) and a partial block of 8, 4 appears 48 times.\n- **Tens place:** In each block of 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For 400-488, it appears an additional 10 times, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** In each block of 10 numbers, 8 appears once. With 48 complete blocks and a partial block, 8 appears 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** In each block of 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times. For 401-488, it appears 9 times, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, for the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. Now, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, the total number of units digits cycles is 488 divided by 10, which is 48 full cycles and 8 extra numbers (since 48*10=480, and then 481-488). So, in each full cycle, there's one 4 in the units place. That gives me 48 fours from the units place. But wait, in the partial cycle from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once in the units place here as well (484). So, total units place fours are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for numbers 40-49, which is 10 times. So, in each hundred, there are 10 fours in the tens place. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? That's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). So, for each hundred, 10 fours in the tens place. That's 4*10 = 40 fours. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 only once in this partial hundred, which is in 440-449. Wait, actually, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 488 is less than 490, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, right? So that's another 10 fours in the tens place. So, total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of fours is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nUnits place: Similar to fours, in each group of ten, the units digit is 8 once. So, in 488 pages, there are 48 full groups of ten and 8 extra numbers. So, in each full group, 1 eight in the units place: 48 eights. In the partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total units place eights are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For the tens digit, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, in each hundred, 10 eights in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds, so 4*10 = 40 eights. In the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, total tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights here.\n\nSo, total number of eights is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFor fours:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor eights:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** In every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. There are 48 full decades (1-480) and 8 extra numbers (481-488). Each decade contributes 1 four, totaling 48. The extra 8 numbers include 484, adding 1 more. Total units place fours: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** In every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). There are 4 full centuries (1-400), contributing 4*10 = 40 fours. The last partial century (401-488) includes 440-449, adding 10 fours. Total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Total hundreds place fours: 89.\n   - **Total Fours:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. Total units place eights: 48 (full decades) + 1 (488) = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** In every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. There are 4 full centuries, contributing 4*10 = 40 eights. The last partial century (401-488) includes 480-488, adding 9 eights. Total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place. Total hundreds place eights: 0.\n   - **Total Eights:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of fours: 188\n   - Number of eights: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, etc. To find how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, and then check the remaining 8 numbers (481-488). Each full group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. In the remaining 8 numbers, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So, total 4's in units place: 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each ten. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in each 100 numbers (40-49, 140-149, etc.). From 1 to 488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. That's 4*10=40. Then, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 0-8. So, from 400-409, the tens digit is 0, then 410-419, tens digit is 1, and so on up to 480-488, where the tens digit is 8. Wait, but in 401-488, the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit being 4 occurs only once in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (440-449). Therefore, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from the first 400) + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nAdding them up: Units (48) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total 4's printed: 187.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, in every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so 8 appears 10 times in each 100. From 1-400, that's 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place: 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. The tens digit is 8 in the range 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, that's 9 8's in the tens place. Therefore, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's here.\n\nAdding them up: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's printed: 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such sets are there? Since the book has 488 pages, the units digit cycles 48 times (because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles and then 8 extra numbers). Wait, actually, each cycle is 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, there are 48 full tens (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, maybe it's better to think differently). Let me correct that. The number of times the units digit is 4 is equal to the number of complete tens plus any extra in the last partial ten. So, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 times (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles). Each cycle contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last page is 488, which ends with an 8, so the units digit doesn't get an extra 4. So, units place: 48 times.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all ten numbers. Then, this repeats every hundred. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? Well, in each hundred, like 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears exactly 10 times (e.g., 40-49). So, how many hundreds are there? Let's see: 1-99: tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, so 10 times. 100-199: same, 140-149, another 10. 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. 400-488: 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 4 sets of 10, so 4 x 10 = 40 times. But wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 40 times in total for the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, that's 89 times.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 40 = 88, plus 89 is 177. So, 177 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, in each set of ten numbers, the units digit is 8 once. From 1 to 488, how many full tens are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, the last page is 488, which ends with an 8, so that's included in the 48th set (480-488). So, units place: 48 times.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, so the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no, actually, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears in 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (another 10), 280-289 (another 10), 380-389 (another 10), and 480-488 (9 numbers because 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total for tens place: 4 x 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check. From 1 to 488, how many times does the tens digit 8 appear? Each hundred has a set where the tens digit is 8. So, 0-99: 80-89 (10 times). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480 is the start, and 488 is the end, so 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, so 4x10 +9=49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97 times.\n\nWait, but wait a second, let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, total 49 times.\n\nSo, number of 4's is 177, number of 8's is 97. So, the difference is 177 - 97 = 80.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nFirst, number of 4's:\n\nUnits place: From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in units? Every 10 numbers, so 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Correct.\n\nTens place: In each hundred, 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10. Plus, in 1-99: 40-49 (10), 100-199:140-149 (10), 200-299:240-249 (10), 300-399:340-349 (10), and 400-488:440-449 (10). Wait, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5x10=50. Wait, earlier I thought it was 4 sets, but actually, from 0-99 (40-49), 100-199 (140-149), 200-299 (240-249), 300-399 (340-349), and 400-488 (440-449). So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50 times. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 40. Hmm, that's a mistake. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, so in the tens place, for 4's, it's 10 times per hundred, and there are 5 hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, in each of these, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, except for the last one, 400-488, which includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50. So, the tens place for 4's is 50, not 40 as I previously thought. So, that's a correction.\n\nSimilarly, the hundreds place for 4's is from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. So, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, plus 89 is 187.\n\nWait, that's different from before. So, earlier I thought 48+40+89=177, but now I'm getting 187. So, I must have miscalculated earlier.\n\nWait, let me recast this. The tens place for 4's: in each hundred, the tens digit cycles, so in 0-99, the tens digit 4 is in 40-49 (10 numbers). Similarly, in 100-199, it's 140-149 (10), 200-299:240-249 (10), 300-399:340-349 (10), and 400-488:440-449 (10). So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. So, tens place:50.\n\nUnits place: 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 times.\n\nHundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 +50 +89 = 187.\n\nNow, let's check the 8's again.\n\nUnits place: same as before, 48 times.\n\nTens place: in each hundred, the tens digit 8 is in 80-89 (10 numbers). So, in 0-99:10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, and 400-488:480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place:4x10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, since we don't reach 800.\n\nSo, total 8's:48+49=97.\n\nThus, the difference is 187 -97=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 177-97=80, but after correcting the tens place for 4's, it's 187-97=90.\n\nWait, let me confirm again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the tens place for 4's.\n\nWait, in the tens place, for 4's, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 is in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, from 1-99:10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, and 400-488:440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 50. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is the fifth hundred, so yes, 50.\n\nUnits place:488/10=48.8, so 48 full cycles, so 48.\n\nHundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nSo, 48+50+89=187.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, units place:48, tens place:49, hundreds:0, total 97.\n\nSo, difference is 187-97=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 177-97=80, but that was due to a miscalculation in the tens place for 4's.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check that again.\n\nFrom 400-488, how many numbers are there? 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, so that's 89 times. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:48 (units)+50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=187.\n\n8's:48 (units)+49 (tens)=97.\n\nDifference:187-97=90.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is equal to:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(N/10), each contributing one d, plus if the last partial group has a units digit >=d, add 1 if d is in the units place.\n\nBut in our case, for d=4 and d=8, since they are less than 10, it's straightforward.\n\nSo, for units digit 4:\n\nNumber of times = floor(488/10)=48, as each group of 10 contributes one 4.\n\nSimilarly, for units digit 8: floor(488/10)=48.\n\nNow, for the tens digit:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the tens place is calculated by considering each hundred. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so each digit appears 10 times per hundred.\n\nSo, for d=4 in tens place:\n\nNumber of hundreds = floor(488/100)=4 (since 488/100=4.88). So, 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 4x10=40.\n\nBut wait, in the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10. So, total is 5x10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8 in tens place:\n\nNumber of full hundreds=4, each contributing 10, so 4x10=40.\n\nIn the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so total is 40+9=49.\n\nFor the hundreds digit:\n\nd=4: appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nd=8: since 488 <800, hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: units(48)+tens(50)+hundreds(89)=187.\n\nTotal 8's: units(48)+tens(49)+hundreds(0)=97.\n\nDifference:187-97=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I want to make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me check with a smaller example to see if my method works.\n\nSuppose we have a book with 28 pages. How many more 4's than 8's?\n\nPage numbers 1-28.\n\nCount of 4's:\n\nUnits:4,14,24 \u2192 3 times.\n\nTens:40-49, but since we only go up to 28, tens digit 4 doesn't appear.\n\nHundreds: none.\n\nTotal 4's:3.\n\nCount of 8's:\n\nUnits:8,18,28 \u21923 times.\n\nTens:80-89, but we only go up to 28, so tens digit 8 doesn't appear.\n\nHundreds: none.\n\nTotal 8's:3.\n\nDifference:3-3=0.\n\nWait, but according to my method:\n\nUnits for 4: floor(28/10)=2, but in reality, it's 3 (4,14,24). Wait, so my formula might be off.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula should be floor((N + 1)/10) for the units digit. Let me check.\n\nFor N=28, units digit 4: (28 +1)/10=29/10=2.9\u2192floor=2, but actual count is 3.\n\nWait, so maybe the formula is floor((N)/10) +1 if the units digit of N is >=4.\n\nWait, let me think. For units digit 4, the count is the number of complete decades plus 1 if the last number's units digit is >=4.\n\nIn 1-28, the last number is 28, units digit 8 >=4, so units digit 4 appears floor(28/10)=2 +1=3 times. Similarly, units digit 8 appears floor(28/10)=2 +1=3 times (since 28 has units digit 8).\n\nSo, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nFor units digit d, the count is floor(N/10) + (1 if N %10 >=d else 0).\n\nSimilarly, for tens digit d, it's a bit more involved.\n\nWait, perhaps I should adjust my earlier approach.\n\nBut in the case of 488, since 488 ends with 8, which is greater than 4 and 8, so for units digit 4, it's floor(488/10)=48 +1 if 8 >=4, which it is, so 49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, now I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units digit count.\n\nWait, let's clarify. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is:\n\nNumber of complete decades: floor(N/10).\n\nIf the units digit of N is >=d, add 1.\n\nBut if d=0, it's a bit different because 0 doesn't appear in the units place for numbers 1 to N.\n\nWait, so for d=4:\n\nNumber of times = floor(N/10) + (1 if N %10 >=4 else 0).\n\nSimilarly, for d=8:\n\nNumber of times = floor(N/10) + (1 if N %10 >=8 else 0).\n\nIn our case, N=488.\n\nSo, for units digit 4:\n\nfloor(488/10)=48, and 488%10=8 >=4, so add 1. So, 48+1=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48. So, that's a mistake.\n\nSimilarly, for units digit 8:\n\nfloor(488/10)=48, and 488%10=8 >=8, so add 1. So, 48+1=49.\n\nWait, so that changes things.\n\nSo, units digit 4 appears 49 times, not 48.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8 appears 49 times.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial calculation.\n\nWait, let me test this with N=28.\n\nFor d=4:\n\nfloor(28/10)=2, 28%10=8 >=4, so 2+1=3. Correct.\n\nFor d=8:\n\nfloor(28/10)=2, 28%10=8 >=8, so 2+1=3. Correct.\n\nSo, the correct formula is floor(N/10) +1 if N%10 >=d, else 0.\n\nThus, in our problem, N=488.\n\nUnits digit 4: floor(488/10)=48, 488%10=8 >=4 \u2192 48+1=49.\n\nUnits digit 8: floor(488/10)=48, 488%10=8 >=8 \u219248+1=49.\n\nSo, earlier I had mistakenly used floor(N/10) without considering the remainder, leading to an undercount by 1 for both 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\nSo, correcting that, units digit 4 appears 49 times, units digit 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens digit.\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to N can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor each hundred, the digit d appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49 for d=4).\n\nThe number of complete hundreds is floor(N/100).\n\nIf the tens digit of N is greater than or equal to d, we need to add 10 for each additional ten.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in tens place = (number of complete hundreds) *10 + (if the tens digit of N is >=d, add the excess over the last complete hundred).\n\nWait, let me try to formalize it.\n\nLet me denote N as ABC, where A is hundreds, B is tens, C is units.\n\nFor digit d in tens place:\n\nNumber of times = (A) *10 + min(B, d)*10? Wait, not exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as:\n\nFor each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so digit d appears 10 times per hundred.\n\nThe number of complete hundreds is floor(N/100). So, for N=488, floor(488/100)=4 (hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399).\n\nEach of these contributes 10 times for digit d in the tens place.\n\nNow, in the incomplete hundred (400-488), we need to check how many times d appears in the tens place.\n\nThe tens digit in this range goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last number). So, for digit d=4:\n\nIn the incomplete hundred (400-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, add 10.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8:\n\nIn the incomplete hundred, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, add 9.\n\nThus, total for tens digit:\n\nFor d=4:\n\nNumber of times = 4*10 +10=50.\n\nFor d=8:\n\nNumber of times =4*10 +9=49.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier correction.\n\nNow, hundreds digit:\n\nFor digit d=4:\n\nIt appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nFor d=8:\n\nIt doesn't appear in the hundreds place since N=488 <800, so 0 times.\n\nSo, total counts:\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:50\n\nHundreds:89\n\nTotal=49+50+89=188.\n\nWait, earlier I thought 187, but now it's 188. Wait, let me add again: 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 49+50+89=188, but earlier I thought 187, so perhaps I miscalculated.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n49 (units) +50 (tens)=99, plus 89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:49\n\nHundreds:0\n\nTotal=49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference=188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 187-97=90, but now it's 188-98=90. So, same difference.\n\nWait, but in the units place, I corrected from 48 to 49 for both 4 and 8, which added 1 each, so total 4's increased by 1, 8's increased by 1, so the difference remains the same: 90.\n\nWait, let me confirm with the smaller example again.\n\nN=28.\n\nUnits digit 4: floor(28/10)=2, 28%10=8 >=4 \u21922+1=3.\n\nTens digit 4: floor(28/100)=0, so 0*10=0, and in the incomplete hundred (0-28), tens digit 4 appears in 4-9 (but wait, in tens place, 40-49, but we only go up to 28, so tens digit 4 doesn't appear. Wait, that contradicts earlier. Wait, no, in 1-28, the tens digit 4 would appear in 40-49, but since we only go up to 28, it doesn't appear. So, tens digit 4 appears 0 times.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8: floor(28/10)=2, 28%10=8 >=8 \u21922+1=3.\n\nTens digit 8: floor(28/100)=0, so 0*10=0, and in incomplete hundred, tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, but we only go up to 28, so 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:3 (units)+0 (tens)+0 (hundreds)=3.\n\nTotal 8's:3 (units)+0 (tens)+0=3.\n\nDifference:0, which matches.\n\nBut according to the formula I used earlier, for tens digit 4 in N=28:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds=0, so 0*10=0.\n\nIn the incomplete hundred (0-28), the tens digit 4 would appear in 40-49, but since 28<40, it doesn't appear. So, 0.\n\nSimilarly, for tens digit 8, same thing.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nSo, going back to N=488.\n\nUnits digit 4:49\n\nTens digit 4:50\n\nHundreds digit 4:89\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nUnits digit 8:49\n\nTens digit 8:49\n\nHundreds digit 8:0\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's correct now.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - Total units place 4's: \\( \\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\rfloor = 48 \\) full groups, plus 1 because the last number (488) ends with 8 \u2265 4.\n   - Total: \\( 48 + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - In each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49).\n   - There are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), contributing \\( 4 \\times 10 = 40 \\).\n   - In the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, adding 10.\n   - Total: \\( 40 + 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - Total units place 8's: \\( \\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\rfloor = 48 \\) full groups, plus 1 because the last number ends with 8.\n   - Total: \\( 48 + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - In each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89).\n   - There are 4 full hundreds, contributing \\( 4 \\times 10 = 40 \\).\n   - In the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n   - Total: \\( 40 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n\\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in the units place, each digit, including 4, appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and a partial group of 8 numbers (since 488 = 48*10 + 8). In each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, that's 48 times. Now, in the partial group from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once more in the units place (484). So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers. Now, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial hundred from 401-488. Each complete hundred contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place, so 4*10 = 40. Now, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each hundred. From 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490). But since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in the 401-410 range, which is 10 times (401-410). But wait, 401-410 is part of the 401-488 range. So, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (401-410). Therefore, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but hold on, when I'm considering the 401-488 range, does that include 401-410? Yes, so the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times there. So, 4 complete hundreds give 40, and the partial hundred gives 10, so total 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188? Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake here because when I add 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds), that's 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 = 188. But wait, I think I might have overcounted because in the hundreds place, the 4's are only from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, but in the tens and units places, we've already counted those 4's. So, actually, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Hmm, but let me think again. Wait, no, that's correct because each digit place is independent. So, the total number of 4's is 188.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. Starting with the units place: Each 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8), so 48 times. Plus, in the partial group from 481-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears once more (488). So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: For the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 occurrences, so 4*10 = 40. Now, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-9. So, the tens digit 8 occurs in the range 480-489. But since we're only going up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in this partial hundred. Therefore, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but hold on, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 40 from the complete hundreds plus 9 from the partial hundred gives 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0, so total 98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's and 8's. Let me go through each digit place again.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit 4 occurs once (484). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n- Tens place: Each complete hundred contributes 10, so 4*10 = 40. In the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 401-410, which is 10 times. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nAdding up: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit 8 occurs once (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n- Tens place: Each complete hundred contributes 10, so 4*10 = 40. In the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n- Hundreds place: No 8's, so 0.\n\nAdding up: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** \n   - Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u21d2 48 complete groups, each contributing 1 \u21d2 48.\n   - Partial group (481-488): 484 \u21d2 1 more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** \n   - Every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - 4 complete hundreds \u21d2 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Partial group (401-488): Tens digit 4 occurs in 401-410 \u21d2 10.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** \n   - From 400-488, 4 appears in the hundreds place for 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** \n   - 48 complete groups \u21d2 48.\n   - Partial group (481-488): 488 \u21d2 1 more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** \n   - 4 complete hundreds \u21d2 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Partial group (401-488): Tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488 \u21d2 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** \n   - No 8's in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, I'll consider 48 full sets, which cover up to page 480. Each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, from 481 to 488, that's 8 more pages. In these, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so no additional 4's in the units place here. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each full hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so that's 4 x 10 = 40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 440-449. That's another 10 times. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: Units (48) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll follow the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the units place: As before, in each set of 10 numbers, the units digit is 8 exactly once. So, from 1 to 488, how many sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place, totaling 48. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so there's one more 8 in 488. So, total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers in each hundred, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full hundreds in 488 pages, so that's 4 x 10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480-488. Wait, no, actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800 to 899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's here.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because when I counted the units place, I had 48 full sets giving 48 8's, and then 488 adds one more, making it 49. For the tens place, in each hundred, it's 10, so 4 x 10 = 40, and in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, 40 + 9 = 49. So, total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Wait, but that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the tens place, for each hundred, it's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more. So, 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nBut wait, when I counted the 4's, I got 187, and 8's as 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, that seems like a lot. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's, in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9, total 49 in the tens place. Units place: 48 full sets (1-480), each contributing one 8, so 48, plus one more in 488, so 49. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 4's are 187, 8's are 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Maybe I should recount the 8's in the tens place. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? It's 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 sets. Each of the first four sets contributes 10 numbers, and the last set contributes 9 numbers (480-488). So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. That's correct. So, 49 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, units place: 8 appears once every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times, plus one more in 488, making it 49. So, units place: 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n4's: Units place: 48, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 = 187.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct. So, 89.\n\nI think that's right. So, the final answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full sets of 10 in 480 pages, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - Pages 481-488 do not add any more 4's in the units place.\n   - Total: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - For every 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).\n   - There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 occurrences.\n   - Pages 401-488 add another 10 occurrences (440-449).\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full sets of 10 in 480 pages, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - Page 488 adds one more occurrence.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - For every 100 numbers, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89).\n   - There are 4 full hundreds, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 occurrences.\n   - Pages 401-488 add another 9 occurrences (480-488).\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **89**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. How many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Dividing 488 by 10 gives me 48 full groups of ten and a remainder of 8. So, in each of these 48 groups, the units digit 4 appears once, giving me 48 times. But wait, there's a remainder of 8, so the last group goes from 481 to 488. In the units place, 484 has a 4, so that's one more. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). How many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred from 401-488. So, in each full hundred, we have 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. From 1-100, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, 101-200: 140-149, another 10. 201-300: 240-249, 10. 301-400: 340-349, 10. So that's 4*10=40. Then, 401-488: the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 times. \n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 89 4's.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with units place: As before, each group of ten has exactly one 8 in the units place. From 1-488, there are 48 full groups of ten and a remainder of 8. So, 48 groups contribute 48 8's. The last group is 481-488, which includes 488. The units digit 8 appears once in this group (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, tens place: The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears in the range 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, that's 10 8's in the tens place. How many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4*10=40. Now, in the partial hundred 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check: 401-488. The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 8's.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me recount the tens place for 8's. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more. So, 40+9=49. Units place was 49, so total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when counting 4's, I had 188 4's, and 98 8's. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full groups of ten, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in 481-488, 484 has a 4, so +1. Total: 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, 440-449 is 10, so +10. Total: 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so +89.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, 488 has an 8, so +1. Total: 49.\n\n- Tens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, 480-488 is 9, so +9. Total: 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the hundreds place for 4's? The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems right.\n\nFor the 8's, in the hundreds place, since the book ends at 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for 8's, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nAnd in the units place, 48 full groups plus 1 in 488, so 49. So, 49 + 49 = 98 8's.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. Now, how many such sets are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then a partial set of 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each full set, there's one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 times. Now, in the partial set from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (page 484). So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, how many full hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred (401-488). In each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449, which is 10 pages. Wait, but 488 is less than 449, so actually, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but since 488 is beyond that, we have all 10 pages. So, that's another 10. So total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488. How many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: Units (49) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nUnits place: As before, in each set of 10, the digit 8 appears once. There are 48 full sets of 10 and a partial set of 8. So, 48 * 1 = 48. In the partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (page 488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For the tens digit, in each block of 100, the tens digit is 8 for exactly 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 full hundreds. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, so that's 9 numbers. So, adding 9 to the previous 40 gives 49. Wait, but let me check: 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me double-check the tens place for 8's. In the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? So, 480, 481, ..., 488: that's 9 pages, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated 4's, I had 188, and 8's as 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me check the units place for 8's again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 pages, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the partial set from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nFor the tens place, in each hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens digit, so 4 full hundreds give 40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, total 49. So, 49 in units and 49 in tens, totaling 98. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was counting 4's in the hundreds place, I had 89, which seems correct because from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Then, units and tens added up to 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. That seems right.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when counting the last partial set, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me verify the units place for 4's: up to 488, how many 4's in units? Each 10 pages, so 48 full sets (480) plus the last 8 pages (481-488). In the last 8, 484 has a 4 in units. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in units, same logic: 48 full sets, plus 488, so 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nFor tens place of 4's: Each hundred has 10, so 4 hundreds give 40, and in the last partial hundred, 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 more, total 50. Correct.\n\nFor tens place of 8's: Each hundred has 10, so 4 hundreds give 40, and in the last partial hundred, 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 more, total 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 89 pages from 400-488. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 8's: 0, since the book ends at 488. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be 90, but I want to make sure I didn't miss any digits. Let me recount the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: For each digit position, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a formula to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position.\n\nFor the units place, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n is calculated as follows:\n\nLet q = n // 10, r = n % 10.\n\nIf d < r, then count = (q + 1) * 10^(k-1), where k is the position (units is position 1).\n\nWait, maybe it's better to stick with my initial approach since it's straightforward.\n\nWait, but let me try to apply a formula to confirm.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488 / 10) = 48 full cycles, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, check the remainder: 488 % 10 = 8. Since 4 <= 8, add 1 more. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in units: floor(488 / 10) = 48, and since 8 <= 8, add 1. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488 / 100) = 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. The remainder is 488 % 100 = 88. Now, the tens digit is 4, so we look at the higher digits (4) and the current digit (8). Since 4*10 + 4 = 44 <= 88, we add 10 more. So, total 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNumber of 8's in tens: floor(488 / 100) = 4, so 4*10=40. Remainder is 88. The tens digit is 8, so we look at higher digits (4) and current digit (8). Since 4*10 + 8 = 48 <= 88, we add 10 more. Wait, but in the tens place, the formula is a bit different. Wait, actually, the formula for the tens digit is:\n\ncount = higher * 10^(k-1) + min(current_digit, d) * 10^(k-2) + 1 if current_digit > d.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me stick with my initial counting.\n\nSo, for 8's in tens place, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nFor hundreds digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488 / 1000) = 0, but since 488 >= 400, the hundreds digit is 4 for 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages.\n\nNumber of 8's: 0, since 488 < 800.\n\nSo, yes, the counts are correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. Now, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10 and then a partial group of 8 pages (481-488). So, in the units place, the number of 4's is 48 (from the full groups) plus 1 (since 484 is in the partial group). Wait, no, the partial group is 481-488, which includes 484, so that's one more 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for the tens digit, each group of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, for each hundred, we have 10 4's in the tens place. That's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 400-488, the tens digit is 0 in 401-410, 1 in 411-420, and so on up to 8 in 481-490. Wait, but we only go up to 488, so the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. But since we're only going up to 488, does that affect it? Wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, it's fully included. So that's another 10 4's in the tens place. Therefore, total tens place 4's: 40 (from the full hundreds) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but let me check: 400 is included, so from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: Units (49) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again.\n\nStarting with the units place: As before, in each group of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, with 48 full groups of 10 and a partial group of 8 pages, the units place 8's would be 48 (from the full groups) plus 0 (since the partial group is 481-488, and the units digits are 1-8, so 8 is included once. Wait, 488 is the last page, so in the units place, 8 appears once in the partial group. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: In each group of 100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 10 times per 100 numbers. For the first 400 pages, that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place here? It's in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 in each of these, so that's 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 (from the first 400) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, there are 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full groups (1-480) give 48 4's. Then, 481-488 includes 484, so +1, total 49.\n- Tens: Each hundred has 10 4's in tens place. 4 hundreds (1-400) give 40. Then, 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10, so total 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full groups (1-480) give 48 8's. Then, 481-488 includes 488, so +1, total 49.\n- Tens: Each hundred has 10 8's in tens place. 4 hundreds give 40. Then, 401-488 includes 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so +9, total 49.\n- Hundreds: 0, as before.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** Each group of 10 numbers contributes 1 occurrence. There are 48 full groups (1-480) and one partial group (481-488) with 484, so 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences. Four full hundreds (1-400) give 40, and 440-449 in 401-488 adds 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 has 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** Each group of 10 contributes 1. With 48 full groups and 488, there are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** Each hundred contributes 10. Four full hundreds give 40, and 480-488 adds 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, for the units place: In every set of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. So, from 1 to 488, how many full sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 full sets. Each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, the last set is 481-490, but our book ends at 488, so we have to check if 488 includes a 4 in the units place. 488 ends with 8, so the units place 4's go up to 484, which is within the 480-489 range. So, actually, the number of 4's in the units place is 48. \n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in every block of 100 numbers, 10 times. For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all ten numbers. So, how many full hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, we also have the 400-488 range, which is part of the fifth hundred. In this range, the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 400-409, 410-419, etc., but since we're only going up to 488, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? From 400-488, the tens digit cycles every 100, but since we're only going up to 488, which is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, and 480-488. Wait, no, that's not right. Actually, the tens digit cycles every 100, so in the 400-499 range, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 times. But since our book ends at 488, we have to check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. Therefore, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times in the 400-488 range. So, total tens digit 4's are 4 full hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the incomplete hundred, totaling 50. Wait, but earlier I thought 4 full hundreds give 40, and then 10 more in the fifth hundred, so 50. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct because the fifth hundred is only up to 488, but the tens digit 4 in that hundred occurs only once from 440-449. So, maybe it's 40 + 10 = 50. \n\nWait, no, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me clarify. The hundreds place: For the hundreds digit, the digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, contributing 89 4's. \n\nWait, but I'm supposed to count the number of times the digit 4 appears, not the number of numbers. So, in the hundreds place, every number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. \n\nWait, but earlier I was considering the tens and units places separately. Let me make sure I'm not confusing the counts. So, to summarize, the total number of 4's is the sum of 4's in the units, tens, and hundreds places. \n\nSo, units place: 48 times (as calculated earlier). \n\nTens place: In each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, in 0-99, it's 40-49; in 100-199, it's 140-149; and so on. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 400-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. So, total tens digit 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. \n\nHundreds place: As calculated, 89 times. \n\nSo, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total. \n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. \n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, in every set of ten numbers, the units digit 8 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many full sets of ten are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. But again, we have to check if the last partial set includes an 8. The last number is 488, which ends with 8, so that's an additional 8 in the units place. So, total units digit 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. \n\nTens place: Similarly, in each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times. For example, in 0-99, it's 80-89; in 100-199, 180-189; and so on. So, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399). Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. Therefore, total tens digit 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. \n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the 800-899 range, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds digit 8's: 0. \n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and the last number is 488, which adds one more 8, so 49. Tens: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 8's, so 40, plus in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more, totaling 49. So, yes, 49 + 49 = 98. \n\nNow, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. \n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFirst, 4's: \n\nUnits place: From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48. But since 488 ends with 8, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, so yes, 48 times. \n\nTens place: In each hundred, 10 times. So, 4 hundreds (0-399) contribute 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, 40 + 10 = 50. \n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. \n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. \n\nNow, 8's: \n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Plus the last number 488, which adds one more, so 49. \n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 8's, so 40. Plus in 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more. Total 40 + 9 = 49. \n\nHundreds place: None, so 0. \n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. \n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89. \n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 89 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** Every 10 numbers contribute one 4. With 48 full sets of ten, that's 48 occurrences. \n- **Tens place:** Every 100 numbers contribute 10 occurrences. With 4 full hundreds and an additional 10 in the 400-488 range, that's 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** Every 10 numbers contribute one 8, totaling 48. The last number 488 adds one more, making it 49.\n- **Tens place:** Every 100 numbers contribute 10 occurrences. With 4 full hundreds and an additional 9 in the 400-488 range, that's 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

How many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times. But wait, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for every block of 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each hundred.

Wait, but we only go up to 488, so the tens digit goes up to 8, but only up to 488. So, in the 400s, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10 times. So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, no, that might be double-counting. Let me think again. From 1-400, we have 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 numbers, right? So, the tens digit cycles 0-8, each digit appearing 10 times except maybe the last one. Wait, 88 divided by 10 is 8.8, so each digit from 0-8 appears 9 times except for 8, which appears 8 times? Hmm, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it differently. The hundreds place: For 4's in the hundreds place, it's only in the 400-488 range. The hundreds digit is 4, so that's 88 numbers (400-488), but the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so that's 89 times? Wait, no, 400 is the first page with hundreds digit 4, and 488 is the last. So, from 400-488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 times. So, hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the 400-488 range, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nNow, for the tens place, from 1-400, we have 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nUnits place: From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, so 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial cycle (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 4 appears once more (484). So, units place 4's: 48 +1=49.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial cycle (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So, units place 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place: For the tens digit 8, it appears in numbers like x8y, where x is the hundreds digit and y is the units digit. Let's break it down.\n\nFrom 1-400: The tens digit cycles 0-9 for each hundred. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40.\n\nNow, in 401-488: The tens digit can be 0-8. So, 8 appears in 480-488. From 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all numbers from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, tens place 8's: 40 (from 1-400) +9=49.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's 9 times the tens digit 8. So, total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the 800-899 range, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98.\n\nNow, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal: 49+50=99+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 4's. Let me recount that.\n\nTens place for 4's: From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 times 4 in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40+10=50. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, tens place: From 1-400, 4*10=40. In 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place for both 4 and 8: 48 full cycles, plus 1 in the last partial cycle, so 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: For 4's, it's 89 times (400-488 inclusive). For 8's, it's 0. Correct.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 188, 8's are 98, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a hundreds digit of 4. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, yeah, I think 90 is the correct difference.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra numbers. Each set contributes one 4, so that's 48 fours. But wait, in the incomplete set from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, in this last partial set, the units digit is 4 once (at 484). So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for every block of 100 numbers. Specifically, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9, so for each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, there are four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the fourth hundred. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, that's 4 times 10, which is 40. But wait, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10. Wait, but 401-488 includes 400-488, so maybe I should think of it as 400-488. So, the tens digit 4 in 400-488 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total tens place 4's are 40 (from 1-400) plus 10 (from 400-488), totaling 50. Hmm, but wait, let me check that again. From 1-100: 40-49, that's 10. From 101-200: 140-149, another 10. 201-300: 240-249, 10. 301-400: 340-349, 10. Then 401-488: 440-449, 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. So, tens place 4's are 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but that doesn't sound right because, for example, 400 has a 4 in the hundreds place, 401 also, up to 488. So, yes, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since our book only goes up to 488, it's 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but wait a second: 400 to 488 inclusive is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with units place: For every set of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last partial set is 481-488, which includes 488. So, in the units place, 8 appears once in the last partial set (at 488). So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for every block of 100 numbers. Specifically, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, so 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? Four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. In each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times. So, that's 4 times 10 = 40. Now, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since our book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in this partial hundred. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1-100: 80-89, 10 numbers. 101-200: 180-189, 10. 201-300: 280-289, 10. 301-400: 380-389, 10. Then 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10=40 plus 9=49. So, tens place 8's are 49.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's are 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nCounting 4's:\n- Units: 48 full tens (each contributing 1) = 48, plus 1 in the last partial set (484), so 49.\n- Tens: 5 sets of 10 (from 1-400, each hundred contributing 10, and 400-488 contributing another 10), totaling 50.\n- Hundreds: 89 numbers from 400-488, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nCounting 8's:\n- Units: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, plus 1 in the last partial set (488), so 49.\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds contributing 10 each, totaling 40, plus 9 in the last partial hundred (480-488), so 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 fours in the tens place for that range. So, adding up, 40 from the first four hundreds and 10 from 400-488, making 50. That seems right.\n\nFor the 8's, in the tens place, the last partial hundred is 401-488, where the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 tens place 8's there. So, 40 from the first four hundreds plus 9 gives 49. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place for both 4 and 8 are 49 each, so that's consistent.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - For every set of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of ten (1-480), contributing 48 fours.\n   - The last partial set (481-488) includes 484, adding 1 more.\n   - Total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49).\n   - There are four full hundreds (1-400), contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 fours.\n   - The range 401-488 includes 440-449, adding another 10.\n   - Total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, 8 appears once in every set of ten.\n   - 48 complete sets contribute 48, with 488 adding 1 more.\n   - Total units place 8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - In each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89).\n   - Four full hundreds contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - The range 401-488 includes 480-488, contributing 9.\n   - Total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and a partial set of 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each of the 48 complete sets, there's one 4 in the units place, giving 48 occurrences. Now, in the partial set from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 has a 4 in the units place, which is one more occurrence. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For each hundred, the tens digit goes through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, each complete hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place. There are four complete hundreds (1-400), so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, for the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, adding that, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 401-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. So, yes, that's correct. So, 40 from the first four hundreds plus 10 from the last partial hundred gives 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, in every 10 numbers, the units digit 8 appears once. So, how many complete sets of 10 are in 488? As before, 48 complete sets and a partial set of 8. So, 48 occurrences from the complete sets. In the partial set 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total 8's in units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For the tens digit, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. There are four complete hundreds (1-400), so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the partial hundred 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but actually, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, but wait, 480 is part of the 401-488 range. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place here? From 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, but 480 is part of the 401-488 range, so that's 9 occurrences. So, total 8's in the tens place are 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The tens digit cycles every 100, so in 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 480 is included. So, that's 9 occurrences. So, total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 occurrences.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me double-check. From 1-488, in the tens place, how many times does 8 appear?\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times: e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, in 1-400, there are four hundreds, each contributing 10 occurrences, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488), so 9 occurrences. So, total 40 + 9 = 49. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4's, I had 188. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this because I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's there. Then, in the tens place, I had 50, and units place 49, totaling 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 49, tens place: 49, so 98 total. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for 8's again. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the partial set 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is included, which adds one more 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, 49 occurrences. So, 49 + 49 = 98 8's.\n\nSo, 4's: 188, 8's: 98. Difference: 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Let me check that again. For the tens digit 4, in each hundred, it's 10 occurrences. So, from 1-400, that's four hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That's correct.\n\nSo, yes, 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I remember sometimes when counting digits, especially in higher places, there might be overlaps or something, but I think I accounted for each digit place separately, so it should be okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each place.\n\nFor a digit d in the units place up to N, it's floor(N/10) + min(max(N%10 - d +1, 0), 10).\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, it's floor(N/100) * 10 + something.\n\nWait, maybe I can use a more systematic approach.\n\nLet me try calculating the number of 4's again using a formula.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of 4's = (488 // 10) + (1 if (488 % 10) >= 4 else 0). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, for units digit, the number of times 4 appears is (N // 10) + (1 if (N % 10) >= 4 else 0). So, 488 // 10 is 48, and 488 % 10 is 8, which is >=4, so 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's = (488 // 100) * 10 + (min(488 % 100, 10) if (488 // 100) > 0 else 0). Wait, maybe better to think as:\n\nThe number of times 4 appears in the tens place is:\n\nFor each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, for each complete hundred, it's 10 times. The number of complete hundreds is 4 (since 488 is less than 500). So, 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes up to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 more, making total 50.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's is the number of times the hundreds digit is 4, which is from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: (488 // 10) + (1 if (488 % 10) >=8 else 0). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: (488 // 100) * 10 + (min(488 % 100, 10) if (488 // 100) > 0 else 0). Wait, better to think as:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds is 4, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes up to 8, so from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 more, making total 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 occurrences. The partial set (481-488) adds one more 4, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens place:** For every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. There are 4 complete hundreds, contributing 40 occurrences. The partial hundred (401-488) adds another 10, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 complete sets, contributing 48 occurrences. The partial set adds one more, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens place:** For every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times.

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let's count the number of times 4 appears in the units place. For every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks of 10, and then an additional 8 pages (481-488). In each of these 48 blocks, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 would be the only page with a 4 in the units place here. So, that's one more 4. Therefore, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, let's count the number of times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, in 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10 times, and so on. So, for every 100 numbers, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, beyond 400, we have 401-488. The tens digit here is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit for 481-488 is 8. Wait, but I'm looking for 4's in the tens place. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449. That's another 10 pages. So, total 4's in the tens place would be 40 (from the first 400 pages) plus 10 (from 440-449), totaling 50.\n\nWait, but hold on, 488 is less than 500, so after 400, the next hundred would be 400-499, but we only go up to 488. So, in 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 only once in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, adding 10 more 4's in the tens place, making it 50 in total.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is the sum of 4's in units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. We'll count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4's, in each block of 10, the units digit cycles 0-9, so 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, that's 48 full blocks of 10 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8), so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is included, which is an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. For 8's in the tens place, similar to 4's, in each block of 100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, beyond 400, we have 401-488. The tens digit here is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., up to 8 for 481-490, but we only go up to 488. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, that's 8 more 8's in the tens place. Therefore, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only when the number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place: 48, hundreds place: 0. So, 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 48 full blocks (1-480), each contributing 1, so 48. Then, 481-488 has 484, so +1. Total 49.\n- Tens place: 4 full hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10, so 40. Then, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 48 full blocks (1-480), each contributing 1, so 48. Then, 481-488 includes 488, so +1. Total 49.\n- Tens place: 4 full hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10, so 40. Then, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 481-488, which is 8 numbers (481-488), so +8. Total 48.\n- Hundreds place: 0, as 800-899 isn't included.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. From 401-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? The tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488. That's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. Wait, but 480 is included in 401-488? No, 480 is actually in 401-488, right? Because 401-488 includes 480. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, I think I made a mistake here. Earlier, I thought it was 8 numbers, but it's actually 9. So, the tens place for 8's beyond 400 is 9, not 8.\n\nWait, let me recount. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 8's in the tens place beyond the first 400. So, the total 8's in the tens place would be 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8, but actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, that changes the count.\n\nSo, correcting that:\n\nFor 8's in the tens place:\n- 1-400: 4 * 10 = 40\n- 401-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8\nSo, total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nTherefore, total 8's would be:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 480-488 is 9 numbers, but 480 is included in 401-488, so it's correct. So, 49 in tens place. So, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place was 49, and the tens place was 48, making 97. Now, with the correction, the tens place is 49, making total 8's 98.\n\nWait, let me check again. Units place for 8's: 48 full blocks (1-480), each contributing 1, so 48. Then, 481-488 includes 488, so +1. So, units place is 49.\n\nTens place: 1-400: 4 * 10 = 40. Then, 401-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so +9. So, tens place is 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nBut wait, that would make the total 8's 98, and 4's are 188, so the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the tens place was 48, but now it's 49. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 more 8's in the tens place beyond the first 400. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 91, but now it's 90. So, which one is correct?\n\nLet me recount the 8's in the tens place beyond 400. From 401-488, the numbers where the tens digit is 8 are 480-488. That's 9 numbers: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, 9 numbers, hence 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, 40 (from 1-400) + 9 = 49 in tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 97 8's, but now it's 98. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units place for 8's. Let's see: from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nIn each block of 10, 8 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once (at 488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 91, but now it's 90. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial count.\n\nWait, let me check the 4's again. Did I count correctly?\n\n4's in units place: 48 full blocks (1-480), each contributing 1, so 48. Then, 481-488 includes 484, so +1. Total 49.\n\n4's in tens place: 4 full hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10, so 40. Then, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n4's in hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nTens place: 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I initially thought it was 91, but after correcting the tens place count, it's 90. So, I think 90 is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me check once more to be sure.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: floor(488/10) + min(488%10 >=4 ? 1 : 0). Wait, but actually, it's better to think in terms of full cycles and partial cycles.\n\nWait, perhaps using a formula would help.\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor(N/10) + (1 if the units digit of N is >= d else 0).\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place: floor(N/100) * 10 + max(0, min(N%100 - (d*10), 9)) + 1 if N%100 >= d*10 else 0.\n\nWait, maybe that's overcomplicating. Let me try applying it.\n\nFor 4's in units place:\n\nN = 488.\n\nNumber of full decades: floor(488/10) = 48.\n\nIf the units digit of N is >=4, add 1. Since 488's units digit is 8 >=4, so units place 4's: 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in tens place:\n\nNumber of full centuries: floor(488/100)=4.\n\nEach contributes 10 4's in the tens place: 4*10=40.\n\nNow, the remaining part is 488 - 400 = 88.\n\nIn the tens place, the current digit is 8, so how many times does 4 appear in the tens place beyond 400?\n\nFrom 400 to 488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8.\n\nSo, the number of times 4 appears in the tens place is when the tens digit is 4, which is 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10.\n\nThus, total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nFrom 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 numbers (488-400+1=89).\n\nSo, 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place:\n\nfloor(488/10)=48.\n\nUnits digit of 488 is 8 >=8, so add 1: 48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nfloor(488/100)=4.\n\nEach contributes 10 8's in the tens place: 4*10=40.\n\nRemaining part: 488-400=88.\n\nIn the tens place beyond 400, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8.\n\nSo, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nThus, 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 800-899, but N=488 <800, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nThus, difference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is calculated by considering each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately. Similarly, the number of times the digit 8 appears is calculated. Subtracting the count of 8's from the count of 4's gives the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** In every block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 full blocks (1-480), contributing 48. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 484, adding 1. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** In every block of 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For 1-400, that's 40. From 401-488, 440-449 adds 10. Total: 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. 48 full blocks (1-480) contribute 48. The remaining 8 numbers include 488, adding 1. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** In every block of 100, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. For 1-400, that's 40. From 401-488, 480-488 adds 9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers). Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No numbers in 1-488 have 8 in the hundreds place. Total: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90. \n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That would be 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so after 480, we have 481-488. In that last partial set, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, in each hundred, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many hundreds do we have? From 1-488, we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. Each full hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 times 10 is 40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit is 8 for 481-488. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 doesn't appear in the last partial hundred. Therefore, total 4's in the tens place are 40.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Therefore, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 40 + 89. Let me calculate that: 48 + 40 is 88, plus 89 is 177. So, there are 177 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, looking at units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: As before, in every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of 10 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8). So, 48 times. But again, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more in the units place (at 488). Therefore, total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: For the tens digit, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place. From 1-488, we have 4 full hundreds and a partial hundred. So, 4 full hundreds contribute 4 * 10 = 40 8's. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers, contributing 9 more 8's. Therefore, total 8's in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's in the hundreds place are 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 177 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 79.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFor the 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 40\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 40 = 88; 88 + 89 = 177. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's:\n- Units: 48 + 1 = 49\n- Tens: 40 + 9 = 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, 177 - 98 = 79. Therefore, there are 79 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** In every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. With 48 complete sets of 10 (480 numbers), there are 48 occurrences. The last 8 numbers (481-488) don't add a 4 in the units place. Total: 48.\n- **Tens place:** In each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). With 4 full hundreds, that's 40 occurrences. The last partial hundred (401-488) doesn't add a 4 in the tens place. Total: 40.\n- **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times. Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 40 + 89 = 177.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. With 48 complete sets, that's 48 occurrences. The last partial set adds one more (488). Total: 49.\n- **Tens place:** In each hundred, 8 appears 10 times. With 4 full hundreds, that's 40. The last partial hundred (401-488) adds 9 more (480-488). Total: 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488. Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 177 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 79.\n\n\\boxed{79}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, for the units place: in every set of ten numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. So, how many such groups are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of ten and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times from the full groups, and then in the extra 8 pages, the units digit is 1-8, so no 4 there. So, units place gives us 48 fours.\n\nNext, the tens place: similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each of these 4 hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is another 10 pages. So, that's 10 more fours. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 fours.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding it all up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place: same as before, in every set of ten, the units digit is 8 once. So, up to 488, how many groups of ten? 48 full groups, each contributing 1 eight, so 48 eights. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so that's 1 more eight (page 488). So, units place gives 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\nTens place: similar to fours, but let's check. In each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, in 4 full hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 eights. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 pages (480-488). So, 9 eights in the tens place. So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 eights.\n\nHundreds place: the hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding it up: units (49) + tens (49) = 98 eights.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 48 full groups (480) plus the last 8 pages, which includes 488, so that's 1 more, making 49. Tens place: 4 full hundreds give 40, and in the last 88 pages, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, 40 + 9 = 49. So, total eights are 49 + 49 = 98? Wait, no, units and tens are separate. So, units is 49, tens is 49, so total eights are 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but that can't be right because 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. But let me think again: units place is 49, tens place is 49, so total eights are 98. But wait, the hundreds place is zero, so total eights are 98.\n\nWait, but when I counted fours, I got 187, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me recount the fours:\n\nUnits place: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1 four, so 48 fours. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so no fours. So, units: 48.\n\nTens place: each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nNow, eights:\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1 eight, so 48. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), units digit 8 is on 488, so 1 more. Total units: 49.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nTotal eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when counting, it's easy to miscount the last partial group. For example, in the units place for fours, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so units digits 1-8, no fours. So, correct, units place fours are 48.\n\nFor eights, units place in the last group: 481-488 includes 488, which is units digit 8, so that's correct, 1 more eight.\n\nIn the tens place for eights, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480, 481, ..., 488: that's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nThus, the number of fours is 187, eights are 98, so 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about page 488, it's the last page, so it's included in both the units and tens counts. Let me make sure I didn't double-count or miss anything.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a formula or a more systematic approach. Let's consider each digit position separately.\n\nFor any digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated by considering higher, current, and lower digits.\n\nBut maybe for simplicity, since the number isn't too large, my initial approach is okay.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to calculate the number of fours and eights using a more formulaic approach.\n\nFirst, for the number of fours:\n\n- Units place: For each complete set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. The number of complete sets is floor(488 / 10) = 48. So, 48 fours. The remainder is 488 % 10 = 8, so in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so no additional fours. So, units: 48.\n\n- Tens place: For each complete set of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49, etc.). The number of complete sets is floor(488 / 100) = 4. So, 4 * 10 = 40 fours. The remainder is 488 % 100 = 88. In the last partial set (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 440-449. So, 10 fours. So, tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: For numbers 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. The count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, hundreds place: 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nSimilarly, for eights:\n\n- Units place: floor(488 / 10) = 48 complete sets, each contributing 1 eight. Remainder 8, so in 481-488, units digit 8 is present once (488). So, units: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: floor(488 / 100) = 4 complete sets, each contributing 10 eights. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Remainder 88. In the last partial set (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers: 480-488. So, 9 eights. So, tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: floor(488 / 1000) = 0, so no eights in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because when I think about the last partial set for eights in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but 480 is included in 401-488, right? So, 480 is the first number where the tens digit is 8 in that partial hundred. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. That seems correct.\n\nYes, so I think my calculation is correct. So, the number of fours is 187, and the number of eights is 98. Therefore, there are 89 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). In each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial block from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 is in this range, which adds another 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for the tens digit, every block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 times. So, in each 100-number block, there are 10 4's in the tens place. Now, how many full 100-number blocks are there in 488? There are four full blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the remaining pages are 401-488. In this range, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490. But since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. Starting with the units place: Each block of 10 has one 8 in the units place, just like with 4's. So, 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the partial block 481-488 has units digits from 1 to 8, so 488 is included, which adds another 8. So, units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For the tens digit, each 100-number block has 10 8's in the tens place. So, four full blocks (1-100, 101-200, etc.) each contribute 10, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is within 401-488, right? So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit is 8 for each of these 9 numbers. So, that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's here.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full blocks (1-480) each contributing 1, so 48, plus 484 in the last partial block (481-488), so 49.\n- Tens: Each 100 block contributes 10, so 4 blocks = 40, plus 440-449 in the last partial block, which is 10, so 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48, plus 488 in the last partial block, so 49.\n- Tens: Each 100 block contributes 10, so 4 blocks = 40, plus 480-488 in the last partial block, which is 9 numbers, so 9.\n- Hundreds: 0, as before.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. To find how many times this happens, I can divide the total number of pages by 10. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full set, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, 484 is within this range, and that's one more occurrence. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for the tens digit, every 100 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 times. So, in each block of 100, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many full hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, for each of the 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 occurrences. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 occurrences. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's 10 more. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there here? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. \n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, meaning 48 full sets and 8 extra numbers (481-488). Each full set contributes 1, so 48 times. In the extra 8 numbers, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which is one more 8. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For the tens digit, 8 appears in each block of 100 numbers. For example, in 0-99, it's 80-89, which is 10 times. So, each 100 numbers contribute 10 occurrences. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 occurrences. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 occurrences.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let's count the 4's in the units place. For every group of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. How many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, we'll consider 48 full groups and then the remaining 8 numbers. So, in each of the 48 full groups, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8, so there's no 4 in the units place here. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, the 4's in the tens place. Similarly, for every group of 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each hundred. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). How many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then the remaining 88 numbers (401-488). In each of the 4 full hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so that's 4 times 10, which is 40. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. Therefore, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the 4's in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 occurrences of the digit 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them all up: units place 48, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. So, total 4's are 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that: 48 + 50 is 98, and 98 + 89 is 187. So, there are 187 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll count the 8's in units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\nStarting with the units place. As before, in every group of 10, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so there's exactly one 8 in the units place every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, that's 48 full groups of 10 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups) and then 8 extra numbers. In each group, one 8, so 48 times. In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so there's one 8 in the units place (488). So, total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the 8's in the tens place. For every group of 100 numbers, the tens digit is 8 for exactly 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 full hundreds in 488, so that's 4 groups, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, totaling 4*10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 8 for the numbers 480-489, but wait, our book ends at 488, so it's 480-488. That's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 occurrences. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480, 481,...,488. So, 9 times the tens digit is 8. So, that's 9. Therefore, total 8's in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the 8's in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nAdding them up: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. So, total 8's are 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. For the tens place in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times the tens digit is 8, correct. So, 40 from the full hundreds plus 9 gives 49 in the tens place. Units place: 48 full groups (each contributing 1) and 1 more in 488, so 49. So, yes, 49 + 49 = 98 total 8's.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98. Let me calculate that: 187 - 98. Hmm, 187 - 100 would be 87, but since I subtracted 2 more, I need to add 2 back, so 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct. In the tens place, 50, units 48, total 187. For 8's, units 49, tens 49, total 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nI think that's it. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** In every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 full groups of 10 in 488, contributing 48 fours. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) don't add any 4's in the units place. Total: 48.\n- **Tens place:** In every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds, contributing 40 fours. The remaining 88 numbers (401-488) include 440-449, adding 10 fours. Total: 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, 4 appears in the hundreds place for 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** In every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. There are 48 full groups, contributing 48 eights. The remaining 8 numbers include 488, adding one more. Total: 49.\n- **Tens place:** In every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds, contributing 40 eights. The remaining 88 numbers include 480-488, adding 9 eights. Total: 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place. Total: 0.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, for the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, the 4 is in 4; in 11-20, it's in 14, and so on. Now, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then an extra 8 pages. In each complete set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digit cycles from 1 to 8, so the 4 appears once more in 484. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten numbers. For example, 40-49 have 4 in the tens place for each of those ten numbers. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? The hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, actually, since we're dealing with three-digit numbers, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for numbers 1-99) or 1, 2, 3, or 4 (for 100-488). But for the tens place, the 4 can appear in each hundred block. Let me think: For each hundred, like 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 every ten numbers. So, in each hundred block, the tens digit is 4 exactly ten times. \n\nBut wait, the last hundred block is 400-488, which is only 88 pages. So, does that affect the count? Let me check. In the 400-488 range, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is ten numbers. So, that's ten 4's in the tens place. Therefore, for each hundred block, there are ten 4's in the tens place. \n\nHow many hundred blocks are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. That's five blocks. So, in each of the first four blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit is 4 ten times each. So, that's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, in the last block, 400-488, as I thought, it's another ten 4's. So, total 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, that can't be right because 4 blocks \u00d7 10 is 40, plus the last block's 10, making 50. Hmm, but wait, 0-99 is the first block, which is 100 numbers, right? So, yes, each hundred block has ten 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit still cycles through 0-9 in each ten, so 440-449 is ten numbers, so that's correct. So, total 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). So, in each of these, the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, let me check that: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Yes, correct. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, in every set of ten numbers, the units digit is 8 exactly once. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers in each hundred block. For example, in 0-99, it's 80-89; in 100-199, it's 180-189, and so on. So, in each hundred block, there are ten 8's in the tens place.\n\nHow many hundred blocks are there? Five, as before: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nIn each of the first four blocks, the tens digit 8 appears ten times. So, 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the last block, 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so the numbers 480-488 have 8 in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is nine numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? So, that's nine 8's in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought each hundred block contributes ten 8's in the tens place, but in this case, the last block only goes up to 488, so the tens digit 8 only appears nine times. Hmm, that's a mistake. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is nine numbers. So, that's nine 8's in the tens place, not ten. Therefore, the total tens place 8's would be 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus nine from the last block, totaling 49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: From 400 to 488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's nine numbers, so nine 8's. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place count because I might have made a mistake. Let's go through each hundred block:\n\n- 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 8's in tens place.\n- 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 8's.\n- 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 8's.\n- 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 8's.\n- 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 8's.\n\nSo, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place had 49, tens place 49, so total 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 188, and the number of 8's was 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me go through each digit place again for 4's.\n\nUnits place: 48 complete sets of ten, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in 481-488, the units digit 4 appears once in 484. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred block contributes ten 4's in the tens place. There are five hundred blocks, each contributing ten 4's, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. Wait, but earlier I thought that in the 400-488 block, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is ten numbers, so that's correct. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in 481-488, 488 has an 8 in units place, so 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: Each of the first four hundred blocks contributes ten 8's, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. The last block, 400-488, contributes nine 8's in the tens place, so 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: None, since the book doesn't reach 800. So, 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the hundreds place for 4's, I included all numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. But in those numbers, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's correct. Similarly, for the tens and units places, I think I accounted for all possibilities correctly.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for 8's again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Well, in every ten numbers, it's once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times, plus the 8 in 488, making it 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, as I did before, it's 49. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again: Is there a possibility that I double-counted any digits? For example, in the number 448, the digit 4 appears three times, but I counted each occurrence separately in units, tens, and hundreds places. Similarly, in 88, the digit 8 appears twice, but I counted each occurrence in units and tens. So, I think my method is correct because each digit position is considered separately, and overlapping digits are accounted for correctly.\n\nAnother way to approach this problem is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position across all page numbers. Since each position (units, tens, hundreds) is independent, we can calculate them separately and then sum them up.\n\nSo, for the digit 4:\n\n- Units place: As calculated, 49 times.\n- Tens place: 50 times.\n- Hundreds place: 89 times.\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times.\n- Tens place: 49 times.\n- Hundreds place: 0 times.\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book, then finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** In every block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. There are 48 complete blocks (1-480), contributing 48 occurrences. The last 8 pages (481-488) add 1 more (484). Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** In every block of 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). There are 5 blocks (0-99, 100-199, ..., 400-488). Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last block (400-488) contributes 10 (440-449). Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. 48 complete blocks contribute 48, and the last 8 pages add 1 (488). Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** In each block of 100, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. The first four blocks contribute 40. The last block (400-488) contributes 9 (480-488). Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place. Total: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14; and so on. Now, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. So, in each of the 48 full sets, we get one 4 in the units place, which is 48 times. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial set, the units digit 4 appears once (page 484). Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each set of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, how many full hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds. Each of these contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, we have the remaining 88 pages (401-488). In this partial hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 in the 400s, which is 10 numbers (401-410). So, that's another 10. Therefore, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only for page numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nWait, let me check that. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, and adding 1 gives 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll follow the same approach, checking each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: As before, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. There are 48 full sets of 10 in 488, giving 48 occurrences. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (page 488). So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The tens digit is 8 for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, etc. In each set of 100, this happens 10 times. There are 4 full hundreds in 488, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 occurrences. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. From 401 to 488, the tens digit being 8 occurs in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 8's in the tens place. Therefore, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only for page numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. In the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 8's in the tens place. So, 40 from the full hundreds and 9 from the partial, totaling 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place had 49 and the tens place had 49, so total 98 8's.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full sets of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus the last 8 pages (481-488), where the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers (401-410). So, 10. Total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full sets of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus the last 8 pages (481-488), where the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9. Total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, as there are no page numbers from 800-899.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 8's in the tens place. So, 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49. So, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 full sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 occurrences. The last 8 numbers (481-488) add 1 more 4 (484). Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** In each 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. With 4 full hundreds, that's 40. The last 88 numbers (401-488) add another 10 (40-49 in the tens place). Total: 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, totaling 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears 48 times in full sets and once in the last 8 numbers. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears 10 times in each 100. With 4 full hundreds, that's 40. The last 88 numbers add 9 (480-488). Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No 8's as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of ten numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many such groups are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups and an extra 8 pages (481-488). So, in each of the 48 full groups, the units place has a 4 once, so that's 48 times. Plus, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit is 4 in 484, so that's one more. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, in the tens place, 4 appears in a block of ten numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1 to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, actually, since page numbers start at 1, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, for the tens place, 4 can appear in the tens position in each hundred block. So, from 1-99: 40-49 (10 times). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 times). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 times). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 times). Now, from 400-488: 440-449 would be 10 times, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, total number of 4's in the tens place: 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. Wait, but let me check. From 1-99: 40-49 is 10. Then 100-199: 140-149 is 10. 200-299: 240-249 is 10. 300-399: 340-349 is 10. 400-488: 440-449 is 10, but 449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: Units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of ten, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many full groups of ten are there? 48 full groups (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8), so 48 times. Plus, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit is 8 in 488, so that's one more. So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers, since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, each block contributes 10 8's except the last one, which contributes 9. So, let's count:\n\nFrom 1-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nFrom 100-199: 180-189 is 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\nFrom 200-299: 280-289 is 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\nFrom 300-399: 380-389 is 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\nFrom 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, that's 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only from page 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: Units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, total 4's are 188 and total 8's are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 full groups (1-480) give 48 4's, plus 484 in 481-488, so 49.\n- Tens: 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, etc.) each giving 10, so 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 full groups (1-480) give 48 8's, plus 488, so 49.\n- Tens: 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, etc.) each giving 10, except the last one (480-488) giving 9, so 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10 and an additional 8 numbers. Thus, 48 \u00d7 1 + 1 (from 484) = 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks, each contributing 10 4's: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers: 89.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups and an additional 8 numbers, with 8 appearing once in the last group (488): 48 + 1 = 49.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full blocks and a partial block (480-488) contributing 9 8's: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488: 0.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, etc. Now, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, there are 48 complete groups and a partial group of 8 pages (481-488). In each complete group, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once here as well (484). So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for the tens digit, each group of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, in 0-99, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, in each block of 100, there are 10 4's in the tens place. Now, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? That's 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). So, 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 4's in the tens place. Now, the remaining pages are 401-488. The tens digit here can be 0-8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 4's. Wait, but 488 is only up to 488, so 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 more. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, contributing 89 4's.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers, so each of these contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, actually, when I calculated the tens place, I think I made a mistake. Let me go back. So, in the tens place, each block of 100 has 10 4's in the tens place. So, for 4 blocks (1-400), that's 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 more. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: From 1-488, each 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit 4 occurs once (484). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Hmm, that seems high, but let's go with it for now.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, counting each digit place separately.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place (8, 18, 28, etc.). So, in 488 pages, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: For the tens digit, each group of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 8 (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, in each block of 100, that's 10 8's in the tens place. There are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, the tens digit is 8 in 9 numbers here. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 (from the first 400) + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 4's were 188 and 8's are 98, so the difference would be 90. But let me double-check my counts because 188 seems high for 4's.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's more carefully. Maybe I overcounted.\n\nStarting with the units place: For each 10 numbers, one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. So, how many terms are there? The last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, 10(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times in the units place. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place: For each 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, in each 100, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, for 400 pages, that's 4 times 10, which is 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, for the 8's, let me check again.\n\nUnits place: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, the last term is 488, which is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, 10(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\nTens place: In each 100, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for 400 pages, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 more. So, total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: As before, no 8's in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Maybe I overcounted in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me think: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. That's correct.\n\nWait, but when I count the tens place for 4's, from 401-488, I included 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 50 in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: 49, correct.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds: 0. So, 98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I feel like 188 4's might be too high. Let me think again. Maybe I'm counting the hundreds place incorrectly. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately using a formula.\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n can be calculated as floor(n/10) + (1 if the units digit of n is >= d else 0). Similarly, for the tens place, it's floor(n/100)*10 + something, and for the hundreds place, it's similar.\n\nBut perhaps I should use a more systematic approach.\n\nLet me try to calculate the number of 4's:\n\nUnits place:\nNumber of 4's = floor(488/10) + (1 if 488%10 >=4 else 0)\n= 48 + (8 >=4 ? 1 : 0)\n= 48 +1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\nNumber of 4's = floor(488/100)*10 + (min(488%100, 99) - 40 +1) if 488%100 >=40 else 0\nWait, maybe it's better to think as:\nNumber of complete hundreds = floor(488/100) = 4\nEach contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\nThen, in the remaining part (488%100 = 88), the tens digit is 8, so the number of 4's in the tens place in 400-488 is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 +10=50.\n\nHundreds place:\nNumber of 4's = floor((488 - 400 +1)/1000) *100 + (if 400 <=488, then 488 -400 +1 else 0)\nWait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place:\nNumber of 8's = floor(488/10) + (1 if 488%10 >=8 else 0)\n=48 + (8 >=8 ?1 :0)\n=48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\nNumber of 8's = floor(488/100)*10 + (if 488%100 >=80, then 488%100 -80 +1 else 0)\n=4*10=40 + (88 >=80? 88-80+1=9 :0)\n=40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\nNumber of 8's = floor((488 -800 +1)/1000)*100 + (if 800 <=488, then 488-800 +1 else 0)\nBut since 800 >488, it's 0.\n\nSo, total 8's:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units place:** \n     - For every 10 numbers, '4' appears once in the units place.\n     - Total groups of 10 in 488: 48 complete groups (480 numbers) and a partial group (481-488).\n     - '4' appears once in each complete group: 48 times.\n     - In the partial group (481-488), '4' appears once (484).\n     - Total '4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   \n   - **Tens place:**\n     - For every 100 numbers, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).\n     - Total complete hundreds in 488: 4 (1-400).\n     - '4's in tens place: 4 * 10 = 40.\n     - In 401-488, '4' appears in the tens place from 440-449: 10 times.\n     - Total '4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   \n   - **Hundreds place:**\n     - '4' appears in the hundreds place from 400-488: 89 numbers.\n     - Total '4's in hundreds place: 89.\n   \n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of '8's:**\n   - **Units place:** \n     - For every 10 numbers, '8' appears once in the units place.\n     - Total groups of 10 in 488: 48 complete groups and a partial group (481-488).\n     - '8' appears once in each complete group: 48 times.\n     - In the partial group (481-488), '8' appears once (488).\n     - Total '8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   \n   - **Tens place:**\n     - For every 100 numbers, '8' appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89).\n     - Total complete hundreds in 488: 4.\n     - '8's in tens place: 4 * 10 = 40.\n     - In 401-488, '8' appears in the tens place from 480-488: 9 numbers.\n     - Total '8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   \n   - **Hundreds place:**\n     - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n     - Total '8's in hundreds place: 0.\n   \n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 times more than the digit '8'. \n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of ten numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears once (at page 4). Similarly, in 11-20, 4 appears once (at page 14), and so on. Now, how many such groups are there in 1-488? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers, which is 48 full groups of ten (since 48*10=480) and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times (once in each group of ten) plus one more time in the extra 8 numbers (at page 484). Wait, no, 481-488: the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once at 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Here, the digit 4 appears in the tens position for an entire block of ten numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all ten numbers. Similarly, this happens in the 140-149, 240-249, and 340-349 ranges. Each of these blocks contributes 10 instances of the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and then 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block gives 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is part of the 400-488 range, so it's valid. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, total 50. But wait, does 440-449 count as a full block? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 instances. \n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, looking at units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, in each group of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full groups of ten are there? 48 full groups (1-480) and 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, 8 appears 48 times (once per group) plus once in the extra numbers (at 488). So, 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens position for an entire block of ten numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four blocks. Each gives 10 8's, so 4*10 = 40. Now, is there another block beyond 389? The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488. That's 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 instances (480-488). Wait, but I'm counting the tens place, so in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, right? So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me think again. The blocks before 400 are 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), each contributing 10. That's 4 blocks, 40. Then, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, and there are 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, 9 more. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only for numbers from 800 to 899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 8's.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems off because I thought the 8's might be more. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the units place, from 1-488, each group of ten has one 8 in the units place, so 48 full groups (1-480) and 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, the blocks are 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, yes, 49 in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but I thought maybe the hundreds place would have some, but no, since 488 is less than 800, so no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 188, and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's and 8's.\n\nWait, for the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full groups (1-480) plus 484, so 49.\n\nTens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full groups (1-480) plus 488, so 49.\n\nTens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the 8's would be more, but no, 90 seems correct.\n\nWait, let me check another way. Maybe I can write a small program or use another method to verify, but since I can't do that right now, I'll just make sure my counting is accurate.\n\nAnother way to count the number of times a digit appears in each position is to use the formula for each digit place.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor(N/10) + (1 if the remainder is >= d else 0).\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, it's floor(N/100) * 10 + max(0, (N % 100) - d*10 + 1).\n\nWait, maybe that's a better way to calculate it.\n\nLet me try that for 4's and 8's.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\nUnits place:\n\nN = 488.\n\nNumber of 4's in units place: floor(488/10) = 48. Then, check if the remainder (488 % 10 = 8) is >= 4. Yes, so add 1. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That matches.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor tens place, the formula is:\n\nNumber of 4's in tens place = floor(488/100) * 10 + max(0, (488 % 100) - 4*10 + 1).\n\nfloor(488/100) = 4. So, 4*10=40.\n\nNow, 488 % 100 = 88.\n\nSo, 88 - 40 +1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because 40 is the lower bound. Wait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nThe number of times digit d appears in the tens place is:\n\ncount = 0\n\nFor each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9. So, for each complete hundred, the digit d appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, for 488, the hundreds are 0-4. So, 5 hundreds (0,1,2,3,4). For each, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 5*10=50.\n\nBut wait, 488 is in the 400s, so the last hundred is 400-488. The tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 times. So, yes, 5 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 50. That matches.\n\nSimilarly, for the hundreds place, the number of 4's is the number of times 4 appears in the hundreds digit. That's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\nUnits place: floor(488/10) = 48, and 488%10=8 >=8, so 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place: Let's use the formula.\n\nNumber of 8's in tens place = floor(488/100) * 10 + max(0, (488 % 100) - 8*10 +1).\n\nfloor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40.\n\n488%100=88.\n\n88 - 80 +1=9.\n\nSo, total 40 +9=49.\n\nSo, 49 in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but since 488 <800, there are 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's:49 +49=98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 488 -480 +1=9. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place beyond the four complete blocks of 10. So, 4*10=40 plus 9=49, which is correct.\n\nSo, yes, I think 90 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is calculated by examining each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately. Similarly, the number of times the digit 8 appears is counted. \n\n- **4's Count**:\n  - **Units place**: 49 times.\n  - **Tens place**: 50 times.\n  - **Hundreds place**: 89 times.\n  - **Total**: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n- **8's Count**:\n  - **Units place**: 49 times.\n  - **Tens place**: 49 times.\n  - **Hundreds place**: 0 times.\n  - **Total**: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, we'll consider 48 full blocks and then the remaining 8 pages (481-488). So, in each of the 48 full blocks, there's one 4 in the units place, which gives 48 instances. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so there's no additional 4 in the units place here. So, total 4's in the units place: 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for every 100 numbers, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for numbers 40-49, which is 10 times. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then the remaining 88 pages (401-488). In each of these 4 full hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 instances. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), let's see how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit in 401-488 is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490. But since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears from 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, the tens digit 4 would have appeared in 401-410 (tens digit 0), 411-420 (tens digit 1), ..., up to 471-480 (tens digit 7). Wait, actually, in the range 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? It would be from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, so that's 10 instances. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so 440-449 is within 401-488. So, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from the full hundreds) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 instances of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. Wait, 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187? Wait, 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187? Let me add again: 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many full blocks of 10 are there in 488? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 instances. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: For every 100 numbers, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, similar to 4's, in each full hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so that's 4 * 10 = 40 instances. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8, so the numbers are 480-489, but we only have up to 488. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 instances of 8 in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 instances of 8.\n\nSo, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. Units place: 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (488), so total 49. Tens place: In each full hundred, 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40, plus in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4's, I had 187, and for 8's, 98. So, the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. Then, in the tens place, I had 50, and units place 48, totaling 187. For 8's, units place 49, tens place 49, so 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's every 100 numbers, 10 times, so 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) contribute 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. So, total 50. That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: in each full hundred, 10 times, so 4*10=40, plus in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 49. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for units place, 4's: 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48, and in the last 8 pages, no 4, so total 48. For 8's, 48 full blocks plus one in the last 8 pages, so 49.\n\nSo, yes, 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I feel like that might be high. Let me check with a smaller example to see if my method is correct.\n\nSuppose I have a book with 20 pages. How many 1's and 2's are there?\n\nUnits place: For 1's, in 1-20, each 10 numbers contribute one 1 in units place: 1-10 has one, 11-20 has one (11). So, 2 instances. For 2's, similarly, 2 and 12, so 2 instances.\n\nTens place: For 1's, in 10-19, the tens digit is 1 for 10 numbers, so 10 instances. For 2's, in 20, the tens digit is 2 once.\n\nSo, total 1's: units (2) + tens (10) = 12.\n\nTotal 2's: units (2) + tens (1) = 3.\n\nDifference: 12 - 3 = 9.\n\nWait, but if I count manually:\n\nNumbers 1-20:\n\n1: 1\n\n2: 2\n\n3:3\n\n4:4\n\n5:5\n\n6:6\n\n7:7\n\n8:8\n\n9:9\n\n10:1,0\n\n11:1,1\n\n12:1,2\n\n13:1,3\n\n14:1,4\n\n15:1,5\n\n16:1,6\n\n17:1,7\n\n18:1,8\n\n19:1,9\n\n20:2,0\n\nSo, count of 1's:\n\nUnits: 1,11,21? Wait, no, up to 20.\n\nWait, in 1-20, units digit 1 appears at 1,11: that's two times.\n\nTens digit 1 appears at 10-19: 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nTotal 1's: 12.\n\nSimilarly, 2's:\n\nUnits: 2,12: two times.\n\nTens: 20: one time.\n\nTotal 2's: 3.\n\nSo, difference is 12 - 3 = 9, which matches my earlier calculation. So, the method works for this smaller example.\n\nTherefore, I think my method is correct, and the difference is indeed 89.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of ten and then 8 more numbers (481-488). In each complete group, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once in 484. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each complete hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10 times. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: Units place (49) + Tens place (50) + Hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place.\n\nUnits place: For every group of ten, the units digit is 8 once. So, similar to 4's, there are 48 complete groups of ten and 8 more numbers in the last group. So, 48 * 1 = 48, and in the last group (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers in each hundred: 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 480-489, but since the book stops at 488, that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, let's calculate. For each complete hundred (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers each, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in each hundred, it's 10 numbers, so 4 * 10 = 40, and then in the last hundred, it's 9 numbers, so 40 + 9 = 49. But actually, in the last hundred, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since the book stops at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: Units place (49) + Tens place (49) + Hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's list them:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 (since 489 is beyond 488)\n\nSo, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's, the hundreds place is 0, so that's correct.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so 188 - 98 = 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** Every group of ten numbers contributes one 4. There are 48 complete groups (1-480) and one partial group (481-488). Each complete group has 1 occurrence, totaling 48. The partial group adds 1 more, making it 49.\n- **Tens place:** For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for ten numbers (e.g., 40-49). With four complete hundreds and one partial (400-488), this gives 4\u00d710 + 10 = 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** Similar to 4's, there are 48 complete groups and one partial, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** For each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for ten numbers. With four complete hundreds and one partial (480-488), this gives 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). In each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is in this range, which adds one more 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers. For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, how many full hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial hundred from 401-488. In each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place from 401-410, but wait, 401-410 is actually 10 numbers where the tens digit is 0, right? Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. The tens digit in 401-488 is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 is only present in 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 401-410, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 401-410 would have the tens digit as 0, right? Wait, no, I think I'm confusing units and tens. Let me think again. The tens digit is the second digit from the right. So, in 401, the tens digit is 0, in 402 it's 0, ..., up to 409 it's 0, and 410 it's 1. Wait, that's not right. Wait, 401 is 4 0 1, so tens digit is 0; 402 is 4 0 2, etc., up to 409: 4 0 9. Then 410 is 4 1 0, so tens digit is 1. So, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The digit 4 appears in the tens place when the tens digit is 4, which would be from 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 10 more 4's in the tens place. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is the third digit from the right. In 1-99, there's no hundreds digit, so no 4's there. From 100-488, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, which means 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that: 400 is included, so 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's are units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's.\n\nIn the tens place, in each full hundred (1-100, etc.), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40. Then in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nIn the units place, each block of 10 has one 4, so 48 full blocks (1-480) give 48 4's, and then 481-488 has one more 4 in 484, so 49 total.\n\nSo, 89 + 50 + 49 = 188 4's. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: In each block of 10, the units digit cycles 0-9, so 8 appears once per block. So, 48 full blocks (1-480) give 48 8's, and then in 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: In each block of 100, the tens digit 8 appears in 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, in each full hundred, that's 10 8's in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4*10=40 8's. Now, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in 480-488. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's here.\n\nSo, total 8's are units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, that seems off because when I counted 8's in the tens place, I considered 480-488 as having 9 numbers with tens digit 8. Let me check that again. 480 is 4 8 0, so tens digit is 8. 481 is 4 8 1, and so on up to 488, which is 4 8 8. So, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, yes, 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, 40 + 9 = 49 in tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 8's in the units place were 49 and tens place 49, so total 98. But when I counted 4's, I had 188. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But that seems like a lot. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me go through it again.\n\nUnits place for 4's: Each block of 10 has one 4, so 48 blocks (1-480) give 48, plus 484 in 481-488, so 49 total. That seems correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: Each full hundred has 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40. Then in 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, totaling 50. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. So, 89 + 50 + 49 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 blocks of 10 (1-480) give 48, plus 488 in 481-488, so 49.\n\nTens place: Each full hundred has 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. In 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, difference is 188 - 98 = 90. But that seems high. Let me check if I overcounted somewhere.\n\nWait, maybe I overcounted in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the 4's in the hundreds place: 400-488. So, every number from 400 onwards up to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Let me recount that. In each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is in the last partial hundred, so maybe I should adjust that. Wait, in the full hundreds (1-400), the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and then in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449 (10). So, that's 5 sets of 10, but wait, no, because 440-449 is within 401-488, so maybe I should count it as part of the partial hundred. Wait, but in the full hundreds, up to 400, so 400 is included in the hundreds place. So, in the full hundreds, 1-400, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 400-409? Wait, no, 400-409 would have the tens digit as 0. Wait, no, 400 is 4 0 0, so tens digit is 0. So, in 1-400, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, which is 4 sets of 10, so 4*10=40. Then in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is another 10, so total 50. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is in 401-488, so yes, that's 10 more, making it 50 in the tens place.\n\nSo, 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 50 (tens) + 49 (units) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me check if I made a mistake in counting the 8's in the tens place. In 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, 4 full hundreds give 40, plus 9, so 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about another approach. Maybe I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) = 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, plus if the remainder is >=4, add one more. 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly for 8's: floor(488/10)=48, and 488 mod10=8>=8, so 48 +1=49.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)=4 full cycles, each contributing 10 4's, so 4*10=40. Then, the remainder is 88, so how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in 0-88? It appears in 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so add 10. So, total 50.\n\nSimilarly for 8's: floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. The remainder is 88, so how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? It appears in 80-88, which is 9 numbers, so add 9. So, total 49.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/1000)=0, but since 488 >=400, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488. So, 488 - 400 +1=89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nNumber of 8's: Since 488 <800, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot, but maybe that's correct. Let me try a smaller example to check if my method works.\n\nSuppose the book has 20 pages. How many 1's and 2's are there?\n\nPage numbers:1-20.\n\nCounting 1's:\n\nUnits place:1,11,21 (but 21 is beyond 20). So, 1,11: 2 times.\n\nTens place:10-19: 10 times.\n\nHundreds place: none.\n\nTotal 1's:2+10=12.\n\nCounting 2's:\n\nUnits place:2,12,22 (22 is beyond). So, 2,12:2 times.\n\nTens place:20:1 time.\n\nHundreds place: none.\n\nTotal 2's:2+1=3.\n\nDifference:12-3=9.\n\nWait, but let's count manually:\n\nNumbers:1,2,3,...,20.\n\n1's: 1,10-19, so 1 (units), 10-19 (10 numbers, each contributing a 1 in tens place), plus 11 which has two 1's. Wait, but in my earlier method, I didn't count the extra 1's in 11. Hmm, so maybe my method is wrong because it doesn't account for multiple digits in a single number.\n\nWait, this is a problem. Because in my earlier approach, I counted each digit position separately, but in reality, numbers like 11 have two 1's, so I might be undercounting or overcounting depending on the digit.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, I think the approach is correct because each digit is considered separately. For example, in 11, the units digit is 1 and the tens digit is 1, so each contributes to their respective counts. So, in the case of 20 pages, using my method:\n\n1's in units place: floor(20/10)=2, and since 20 mod10=0, which is >=1? Wait, no, the condition is if the remainder is >= the digit. Wait, no, the formula is floor(n/10) + (1 if remainder >=d else 0). Wait, maybe I should think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps my method is correct because for each digit, it's counting how many times it appears in each position. So, for 1's in units place in 1-20: 1,11,21 (but 21 is beyond), so 2 times. Similarly, in tens place, 10-19: 10 times. So, total 12 1's.\n\nSimilarly, 2's in units place:2,12,22 (22 beyond), so 2 times. In tens place:20:1 time. So, total 3 2's.\n\nSo, the method works for 1's and 2's. So, perhaps in the original problem, the method is correct, and the difference is indeed 90.\n\nWait, but let me check another small example to be sure.\n\nTake a 30-page book.\n\nCounting 1's:\n\nUnits place:1,11,21:3 times.\n\nTens place:10-19:10 times.\n\nTotal:13.\n\nCounting 2's:\n\nUnits place:2,12,22:3 times.\n\nTens place:20-29:10 times, but since the book is 30 pages, only up to 29. So, 10 times.\n\nTotal 2's:3+10=13.\n\nDifference:13-13=0.\n\nWait, but in reality, in 1-30:\n\n1's:1,10-19,21,31 (but 31 is beyond), so 1,10-19,21: total 13.\n\n2's:2,12,20-29: 2,12,20-29 (10 numbers), so 12 times. Wait, that's 12, not 13. So, my method gave 13, but actual count is 12.\n\nWait, so maybe my method is slightly off.\n\nWait, in the units place for 2's: numbers 2,12,22: 3 times.\n\nIn the tens place:20-29:10 numbers, but since the book ends at 30, 20-29 is fully included, so 10 times.\n\nSo, total 13 2's, but actual count is 12 because 29 is included, but 30 doesn't add another 2 in the tens place. Wait, no, 30's tens digit is 3, so 20-29 is 10 numbers, each contributing a 2 in the tens place. So, 10 times. So, total 3+10=13, but in reality, in 1-30, the 2's are:\n\nUnits:2,12,22:3.\n\nTens:20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29:10.\n\nSo, total 13. So, my method is correct.\n\nWait, but in 30, the 2's in tens place are 20-29, which is 10 numbers, so 10 2's. So, total 3+10=13.\n\nSo, the method works.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, I think my count is correct, and the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check once more.\n\n4's:188.\n\n8's:98.\n\nDifference:90.\n\nYes, that seems to be the case.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let's count the 4's in the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then an additional 8 pages. So, in each of the 48 blocks, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more in the units place (page 484). So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, let's count the 4's in the tens place. Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers (from x40 to x49, where x is the hundreds digit). So, how many full hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages in the 400s. Wait, actually, 488 is 4 full hundreds plus 88 pages. But wait, the 400s go up to 499, but our book stops at 488. So, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 from 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, we still have those 10 pages because 440-449 is within 488. So, each hundred block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. There are 4 such blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the 400s beyond 400, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is another 10, but wait, that's already included in the 400s block. So, I think I don't need to add more here. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89, plus 89 is 178. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 40 is 89, plus 89 is 178. Hmm, but that seems high. Let me double-check. Wait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. In the tens place, each hundred has 10 4's, so 4 hundreds give 40. In the units place, 48 full tens blocks give 48, plus one more in the last 8 pages, totaling 49. So, 49 + 40 + 89 = 178. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with units place: similar to 4's, in each block of 10, the units digit is 8 once. So, 48 full blocks of 10, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears once more (page 488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, tens place: in each block of 100, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (x80 to x89). So, 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the 400s, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: the hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check again. For the tens place in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49 in the tens place. Units place is 49, so total 49 + 49 = 98. \n\nSo, number of 4's is 178, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 178 - 98 = 80. Wait, that can't be right because 178 - 98 is 80. But let me double-check the counts again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. Let me recount. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those 89 numbers, so 89 4's. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 4's in the tens place: each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 blocks * 10 = 40. That's correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So, 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 + 40 + 89 = 178.\n\nFor 8's: units place: 48 full tens blocks, each with one 8, so 48, plus in the last 8 pages, 488 has an 8, so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: in each hundred block, 10 8's, so 4 blocks * 10 = 40. Then, in the 400s, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 more 8's in the tens place, totaling 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, 178 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 80. So, there are 80 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly? Let me check another way. Maybe I can write a small program or use a formula, but since I'm doing it manually, let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for digit counting. For each digit position, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated based on higher digits, current digit, and lower digits.\n\nBut maybe I should recount for 4's and 8's again to ensure accuracy.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place:\n- From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n- Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48.\n- Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484).\n- Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n- For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9. So, in each hundred, 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (x40-x49).\n- There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40.\n- Now, in the 400s, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10.\n- Wait, but I think I already counted the 400s as part of the hundreds place. No, wait, the tens place is separate. So, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's an additional 10 4's in the tens place beyond the 40 I had earlier.\n- Wait, but earlier I had 40 from the four hundreds, but in the 400s, the tens digit being 4 is part of the 400s, which is the fourth hundred. So, perhaps I double-counted. Wait, no, because the 400s are included in the four hundreds. Wait, no, the four hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, etc., so the 400s are the fourth hundred, and in that, the tens digit being 4 is 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's included in the 40 count. So, I think my initial count of 40 is correct, including the 440-449.\n\nWait, but in the 400s, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's included in the 40. So, total 40 in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place:\n- From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n- So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 178.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nUnits place:\n- Same as 4's: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48.\n- In the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digit is 8 on page 488, so +1.\n- Total: 49.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds * 10 = 40.\n- Now, in the 400s, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488).\n- So, 9 more 8's in the tens place, making it 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n- No 8's, as the book ends at 488, so hundreds digit is 4 or less.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, difference: 178 - 98 = 80.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting the 8's in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. But 480 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, total 8's: 49.\n\nSo, 4's:178, 8's:98, difference 80.\n\nWait, but let me check the 4's in the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's there. That seems correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the answer should be 80 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 178, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 178 - 98 = 80.\n\n$\\boxed{80}$"

So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. Now, how many such groups are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of ten and then an extra 8 pages. So, in each of the 48 full groups, there's one 4 in the units place, giving 48 instances. Now, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so there's another 4 in 484. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, let's count the 4's in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0 to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for each hundred, there's a block where the tens digit is 4. That's 5 blocks in total (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but the last block (400-488) doesn't go up to 499, so I need to check if the tens digit 4 in 440-449 is fully included. Since 449 is within 488, yes, that's fine. So, each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 blocks would give 5*10 = 50. But wait, in the last block (400-488), the tens digit 4 goes up to 449, which is within 488, so it's fully included. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's count the 4's in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 4's. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up: units place 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. So total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll count the number of 8's in units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place: similar to the 4's, every group of ten has one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of ten and an extra 8 pages (481-488). Each full group contributes one 8, so 48. In the extra 8 pages, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so there's an 8 in 488. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place. How many blocks are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's 5 blocks. Wait, but in the last block (400-488), the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, etc.) each contribute 10 8's, so 4*10=40. The last block (480-488) contributes 9 8's. So total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: the hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. So total 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 +89=188. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 +49=98. That seems correct.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** Each group of ten numbers contributes one 4.

So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14; and so on. Now, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, I think it's 48 full groups and then an extra 8 pages. So, in each of the 48 full groups, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Now, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once more in 484. So, total units digit 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for a block of ten numbers. For example, 40-49 have 4 in the tens place. Each such block contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? The first block is 40-49, the next would be 140-149, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, but 540-549 would be beyond 488, so that's not applicable. So, how many blocks is that? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then each hundred block adds another. From 1-99, there's one block (40-49). From 100-199, another block (140-149). From 200-299, another (240-249). From 300-399, another (340-349). From 400-488, the block would be 440-449. So that's a total of 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but I need to check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, it's fine. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. So, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, let me check: from 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99, plus 89 (hundreds) = 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, in each group of ten, the units digit 8 appears once. So, for 488 pages, how many full groups of ten are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total units digit 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, let's see how many blocks we have. From 1-99, the block is 80-89, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199, 180-189, another 10. From 200-299, 280-289, another 10. From 300-399, 380-389, another 10. From 400-488, the block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, how many blocks is that? 4 full blocks (each with 10 8's) and one partial block with 9 8's. So, 4 * 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, tens digit 8's are 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds digit 8's are 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything in the tens place. For the 480-488 block, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers (480-488), so that's correct. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again because I might have made a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: For the hundreds digit, how many times does 4 appear? It's from 400 to 488, which is 89 times. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the hundreds place, since 800 is beyond 488, there are none. So, 0.\n\nWait, but let me check the 4's in the tens place again. I thought there were 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10 4's, so 5 * 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the tens place, I have 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial block (480-488). Each full block gives 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40, and the partial block gives 9 8's, so 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the units place, for 4's, I had 48 full groups of ten, each giving one 4, and then in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once in 484. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, it's 48 full groups, each giving one 8, and in the last 8 pages, 488 has an 8, so 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 4's would be 89, but let me check: from 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: for each digit position, how many times does each digit appear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nFor any digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated by:\n\nFor each position, the number of times d appears is determined by higher digits and lower digits.\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating it. Since the number is 488, which is a three-digit number, let me consider each digit position separately.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place: For each complete set of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, total number of complete sets of 10 in 488 is 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8). So, 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once. So, total 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: same logic, 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, and in the last 8 numbers, 8 appears once. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's in tens place: For each complete hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each ten. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49). Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. Wait, no, 400-488 is part of the fifth hundred, but let's see.\n\nWait, actually, the first hundred (1-100) has one block of 40-49, contributing 10 4's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, each subsequent hundred (101-200, 201-300, 301-400) also has a block of 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, each contributing 10 4's. Then, in 400-488, the block is 440-449, contributing another 10 4's. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5 * 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: Each hundred has a block where the tens digit is 8, e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc. Let's see:\n\nFirst hundred (1-100): 80-89, 10 numbers.\n\nSecond hundred (101-200): 180-189, 10.\n\nThird hundred (201-300): 280-289, 10.\n\nFourth hundred (301-400): 380-389, 10.\n\nFifth hundred (401-488): 480-488, which is 9 numbers, since 488 is the last page.\n\nSo, for the first four hundreds, each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. The fifth hundred contributes 9, so total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNumber of 8's: The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800 to 899, but since our book ends at 488, there are no such numbers. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't double-count any digits or miss any edge cases. For example, in the units place, when I counted 4's, I considered 48 full groups and the last partial group. Same for 8's. In the tens place, I considered each block correctly, including the partial block for 480-488. In the hundreds place, I correctly identified that 4's appear from 400-488, which is 89 times, and 8's don't appear at all.\n\nYes, I think that's accurate. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - For every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full groups of 10 in 488, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - In the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.\n   - This range includes 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - 48 full groups contribute 48 occurrences.\n   - In the remaining 8 pages, 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n   - There are 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 occurrences.\n   - The fifth block (480-488) contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of ten numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. Wait, but since the book goes up to 488, I need to make sure I don't go beyond that. Let me calculate how many full groups of ten there are. From 1 to 488, the number of complete tens is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8). So, in each of these 48 groups, there's one 4 in the units place, giving me 48 fours. But wait, I should check if the last group (481-490) is fully included. Since the book ends at 488, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the units place, the 4 appears in 484, which is within 481-488. So, the count remains 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many times that happens. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so 10 fours in the tens place per range. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 40-49: that's one range. Then 140-149: another, and so on up to 440-449. That's a total of five ranges. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me think again. Each range is 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, from 40-49: 10 fours. Then 140-149: another 10, making it 20. 240-249: 30, 340-349: 40, and 440-449: 50. So, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. Let's see, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? It's 89 numbers because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, but hold on. The hundreds digit is only 4 from 400 to 499, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up the fours from each place: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, there are 187 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, in each group of ten, the units digit 8 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many full groups of ten are there? 48 full groups (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8). So, 48 eights in the units place. But wait, the last partial group is 481-488, which includes 488. So, in that group, the units digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, the total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Each full group of ten contributes one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Let's count how many ranges that is. Each range is 10 numbers, contributing 10 eights in the tens place. So, 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9. So, total tens place eights: 4 ranges \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49.\n\nWait, no. Let me list them:\n\n- 80-89: 10 eights\n- 180-189: 10 eights\n- 280-289: 10 eights\n- 380-389: 10 eights\n- 480-488: 9 eights\n\nSo, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, hundreds place eights: 0.\n\nSo, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier, for fours, we had 187, and for eights, 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89 more fours than eights. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me recount the eights in the tens place. From 80-89: 10 eights. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 full groups (1-480) giving 48 eights, plus 488 which is in the next group, so 49 eights. Correct.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nFor fours, we had:\n\nUnits: 48\nTens: 50\nHundreds: 89\nTotal: 48+50=98+89=187.\n\nSo, 187 fours minus 98 eights equals 89 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place for fours. Let me check again.\n\nFor fours in the units place: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? The last term is 484, which is 480 + 4. So, 484 is the 48th term because 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, so 48 full terms. So, 48 fours in the units place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last 4 in the units place before that. So, yes, 48 fours in units.\n\nTens place for fours: from 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So, 5 ranges, each with 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal fours: 48+50+89=187.\n\nEights:\n\nUnits: 49\nTens: 49\nHundreds:0\nTotal:98.\n\nSo, 187-98=89. So, 89 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be different. Let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 ends with 8, and 488 >= 4, so 48 +1 if 488's units digit is >=4. Wait, no, actually, the formula is (n // 10) * 1 + (1 if n % 10 >= digit else 0). So, for 488 and digit 4:\n\nUnits place 4's: (488 // 10) = 48, and since 488 %10 =8 >=4, so 48 +1=49? Wait, that contradicts my earlier count.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm mixing up. The formula for counting digit d in position p is a bit more involved. Maybe I should use a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units place for fours. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in the units place. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, so which is correct?\n\nWait, when I considered 1-480, I thought it's 48 groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 fours. But 484 is within 481-488, so that's an additional 4 in the units place, making it 49. So, I think I was wrong earlier, and the correct count is 49 fours in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the units place: from 1-488, how many eights in the units place? 8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488, so the number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier when I counted units place fours as 48. It should actually be 49. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, units place fours:49\nTens place fours:50\nHundreds place fours:89\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 187. So, I think I need to recalculate.\n\nWait, let's be precise.\n\nUnits place fours: numbers ending with 4 from 1-488.\n\nThe first such number is 4, the last is 484. The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484.\n\nThe number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the units place:8,18,28,...,488. Last term is 488, so number of terms is ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49.\n\nSo, units place fours:49, eights:49.\n\nTens place fours: from 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449.\n\nEach of these ranges has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d710=50 fours in the tens place.\n\nTens place eights: from 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488.\n\nWait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place for that last range. So, total tens place eights:4 ranges \u00d710=40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place fours: from 400-488. That's 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nHundreds place eights: from 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are none. So, 0.\n\nSo, total fours:49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal eights:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier by miscounting the units place fours as 48 instead of 49. So, the correct total fours are 188, and eights are 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for fours. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 fours, so 50. Correct.\n\nAnd hundreds place fours:400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct.\n\nUnits place fours:49, as per the calculation.\n\nSimilarly, for eights, units place:49, tens place:49, so total 98.\n\nSo, 188 fours -98 eights=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89. So, I must have miscounted the units place fours initially.\n\nWait, let me confirm the units place fours again. The first four is at 4, then every 10 numbers. The last four in the units place is 484, which is within 481-488. So, how many terms? From 4 to 484, step 10.\n\nNumber of terms: ((484 -4)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, eights in units place:8,18,...,488. Last term is 488, so number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=49.\n\nSo, units place fours:49, eights:49.\n\nTens place fours:50, eights:49.\n\nHundreds place fours:89, eights:0.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal eights:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought initially it was 89, but now it's 90. Let me check once more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position.\n\nFor a given digit d and position p (units=1, tens=2, hundreds=3), the number of times d appears in position p up to number N can be calculated as follows:\n\nLet higher = N divided by (10^p)\nLet current = (N / (10^(p-1))) % 10\nLet lower = N % (10^(p-1))\n\nIf current > d: count += (higher + 1) * 10^(p-1)\nIf current == d: count += higher * 10^(p-1) + lower + 1\nIf current < d: count += higher * 10^(p-1)\n\nBut maybe this is overcomplicating. Alternatively, I can use this formula for each digit position.\n\nLet me try calculating the number of fours in each position.\n\nUnits place (p=1):\n\nhigher = 488 // 10 = 48\ncurrent = (488 // 1) % 10 =8\nlower = 488 % 10^0=0\n\nSince current (8) >4, the count is (higher +1)*1=49*1=49 fours.\n\nTens place (p=2):\n\nhigher =488 // 100=4\ncurrent=(488//10)%10=8\nlower=488%10=8\n\nSince current (8)>4, count=(higher +1)*10=5*10=50 fours.\n\nHundreds place (p=3):\n\nhigher=488//1000=0\ncurrent=(488//100)%10=4\nlower=488%100=88\n\nSince current=4, count=higher*100 + lower +1=0*100 +88 +1=89 fours.\n\nSo, total fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, for eights:\n\nUnits place (p=1):\n\nhigher=488//10=48\ncurrent=8\nlower=0\n\nSince current=8 >=8, count=(higher +1)*1=49.\n\nTens place (p=2):\n\nhigher=488//100=4\ncurrent=(488//10)%10=8\nlower=488%10=8\n\nSince current=8 >=8, count=(higher +1)*10=5*10=50.\n\nWait, but wait, the formula says if current >d, but d is 8 here. Wait, no, d is 8, so current=8.\n\nSo, the formula would be: count=higher*10 + lower +1 if current >=d.\n\nWait, actually, I think I need to adjust the formula for when d is the digit we're counting.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to use the formula as:\n\nFor each digit position, the count is:\n\ncount = higher * 10^(p-1)\n\nif current > d: count += 10^(p-1)\nif current ==d: count += lower +1\n\nSo, for units place (p=1), d=8:\n\nhigher=488//10=48\ncurrent=8\nlower=8\n\ncount=48*1=48\n\nsince current=8, which is equal to d=8, so count += lower +1=8+1=9\n\nTotal count=48+9=57? Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought it was 49.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula. Let me check.\n\nWait, no, the formula is:\n\nFor digit d in position p:\n\ncount = higher * 10^(p-1)\n\nif current > d: count += 10^(p-1)\nif current ==d: count += lower +1\n\nSo, for units place, p=1, d=8:\n\nhigher=488//10=48\ncurrent=(488//1)%10=8\nlower=488%1=0 (since 10^(p-1)=1)\n\ncount=48*1=48\n\nsince current=8 ==d=8, count += lower +1=0+1=1\n\nTotal count=48+1=49. That matches.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place, p=2, d=8:\n\nhigher=488//100=4\ncurrent=(488//10)%10=8\nlower=488%10=8\n\ncount=4*10=40\n\nsince current=8==d=8, count += lower +1=8+1=9\n\nTotal count=40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place, p=3, d=8:\n\nhigher=488//1000=0\ncurrent=(488//100)%10=4\nlower=488%100=88\n\nsince current=4 <8, count=0*100=0\n\nSo, total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nSimilarly, for fours, using the same formula:\n\nUnits place, p=1, d=4:\n\nhigher=488//10=48\ncurrent=8\nlower=8\n\ncount=48*1=48\n\nsince current=8>4, count +=1=49.\n\nTens place, p=2, d=4:\n\nhigher=488//100=4\ncurrent=(488//10)%10=8\nlower=488%10=8\n\ncount=4*10=40\n\nsince current=8>4, count +=10=50.\n\nHundreds place, p=3, d=4:\n\nhigher=488//1000=0\ncurrent=(488//100)%10=4\nlower=488%100=88\n\ncount=0*100=0\n\nsince current=4==4, count += lower +1=88+1=89.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nSo, using the formula, I get 188 fours and 98 eights, so the difference is 90.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of ten, each contributing one '4', and an additional '4' in 484. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** '4' appears in the tens place for numbers 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 5 ranges with 10 numbers each. Total: 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** '4' appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n   - **Total Fours:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to '4', '8' appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** '8' appears in the tens place for numbers 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last range being 480-488, contributing 9. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No page numbers in the 800s, so 0.\n   - **Total Eights:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**\nThere are 90 more '4's printed than '8's. \n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of ten numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. Now, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of ten and an extra 8 pages. In each full group, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, page 484 has a 4 in the units place. That's one more. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for the tens digit, each group of 100 pages has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in pages 40-49, which is 10 times. Then, this repeats every 100 pages. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so it's four full hundreds and then 88 pages more. Let me correct that: 488 pages mean 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so that's 4 hundreds * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the remaining pages from 401-488, the tens digit cycles again. The tens digit here goes from 0 to 8 in 401-488. The tens digit is 4 in pages 440-449. That's another 10 pages. Wait, but 488 is only up to 488, so 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's: 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 10 = 50. Wait, but 401-488 is 88 pages, so does that include 440-449? Let me check: 440 is 440, which is within 401-488, and 449 is 449, which is also within. So yes, that's another 10. So total 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the pages 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these 89 pages, so that's 89 times.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the hundreds place, so each page from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 pages, so 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 pages, the units digit is 8 once. So, how many full groups of 10 are there in 488? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, that's 48. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8. So, page 488 has an 8 in the units place. That's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, tens place: For the tens digit, each group of 100 pages has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 8. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, in each hundred, that's 10 times. There are four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the remaining pages 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in pages 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 from 480 to 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place here? Let's see: 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 times. Wait, but in the tens place, each occurrence is a separate digit, so 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me double-check: From 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 8, it's from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, yes, 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds place contributes 0 to the count of 8's.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 full groups (1-480) with one 4 each, so 48. Then, 481-488: 484 has a 4 in units, so +1. Total units: 49.\n\n- Tens: Each hundred has 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so +10. Total tens: 50.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 pages, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, +89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units: 48 full groups, each with one 8, so 48. Then, 488 adds one more, so +1. Total units: 49.\n\n- Tens: Each hundred has 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so +9. Total tens: 49.\n\n- Hundreds: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the tens place for 8's, I counted 9 pages in 401-488, but actually, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, that's correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, totaling 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check that again. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89. So, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. That's correct.\n\nYes, I think that's accurate. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** In every group of 10 pages, 4 appears once. There are 48 full groups (1-480) and one additional group (481-488) where 4 appears once in the units place. Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n- **Tens place:** In every group of 100 pages, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. With four full hundreds (1-400), that's 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. In 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449). Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, 4 appears in the hundreds place for 89 pages. Total: 89.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** In every group of 10 pages, 8 appears once. With 48 full groups (1-480) and one additional group (481-488) where 8 appears once. Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n- **Tens place:** In every group of 100 pages, 8 appears 10 times. With four full hundreds (1-400), that's 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. In 401-488, 8 appears 9 times (480-488). Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488. Total: 0.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. Now, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 complete sets and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). So, in each of the 48 complete sets, there's one 4 in the units place, giving 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is within this range. So, that's one more 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the digit 4 can appear in the tens place. Each time, it's for a block of 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Then, this pattern repeats every 100 numbers. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each of the 4 complete hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers. So that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 440-449, which is another 10 times. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for the numbers 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 times.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: Units (49) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 would be 188? Hmm, that seems high. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so yes, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. So, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 4's: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, okay, maybe that's correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: As before, in each set of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many complete sets of ten are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is included. So, that's one more 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds. In each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89 in the first hundred, 180-189 in the second, etc.), so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for the numbers 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, for the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 4's in the tens place, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 times, so 5*10=50. That's correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4, plus one more in 484, so 49. Correct.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 48 sets plus one in 488, so 49. Tens place: 4 full hundreds contributing 10 each, and in the last partial hundred, 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nSo, 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** In every 10 consecutive numbers, 4 appears once.

    "text": " \n\nFirst, for the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. Now, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of ten and then an extra 8 pages. So, in each of the 48 full sets, there's one 4 in the units place, which gives 48 fours. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 will have a 4 in the units place. So that's one more 4, making the total for units place 48 + 1 = 49 fours.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the digit in the tens place cycles every 100 numbers. Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, there are 10 fours in the tens place. Now, how many hundreds do we have in 488 pages? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, for each of the first four hundreds, we have 10 fours in the tens place. That's 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Now, in the remaining pages from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488. So, the tens digit is 8 only in 481-488, which is 8 numbers. Wait, but I'm counting the tens digit as 4. So, in 401-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, the tens digit is 4 when the number is between 440-449. So, from 440 to 449, that's 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's another 10 fours in the tens place. So, adding that to the previous 40, we get 40 + 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because in the first four hundreds, each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So, total fours in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). In each of these, the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400-488 is indeed 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the fours: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place. Because in the hundreds place, only numbers from 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds digit. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers, so 89 fours. That seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the number of 8's. I'll use a similar approach, counting in units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nUnits place: Just like with 4's, in each set of ten, the units digit cycles 0-9, so 8 appears once in each set of ten. So, how many full sets of ten are there in 488? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 eights. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more 8, making the total for units place 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\nTens place: Similarly, in the tens digit, each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for each hundred, 10 eights in the tens place. How many hundreds? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40 eights. Then, in the remaining 401-488, the tens digit can be 8 in the range 480-488. So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). But wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place would be 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. In the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, adding to the previous 40, we get 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nNow, adding up all the eights: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights.\n\nWait, but let me check again. For the tens place, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 eights. So, 4*10=40 + 9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total fours are 188, and total eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me go through this again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, counting fours:\n\nUnits place: 48 full sets of ten, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), 484 has a 4 in the units place, so 1 more. Total units: 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds contribute 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 more, making 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nEights:\n\nUnits place: 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in 481-488, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so 1 more. Total units: 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. Total tens: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, as the book doesn't go beyond 488.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of ten numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. Now, how many such groups are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, there are 48 complete groups of ten, and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). So, in each of these 48 groups, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Now, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once in 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Here, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten numbers. For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all ten numbers. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, the first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, the next block would be 140-149, and so on. Let me figure out how many such blocks there are. The hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. But wait, since we're starting from page 1, the hundreds digit starts at 0 (for pages 1-99), then 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). So, for each hundreds digit, the tens digit 4 appears once in a block of ten. \n\nFor hundreds digit 0: The tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, which is one block, giving 10 occurrences. \n\nFor hundreds digit 1: The tens digit 4 appears in 140-149, another block, adding another 10.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digits 2, 3, and 4, each contributes a block of ten where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 5 blocks in total (0-4). Each block contributes 10, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, the last block is 400-488. Wait, 400-488 is not a full block of ten because 488 is less than 499. So, the tens digit 4 in the hundreds digit 4 block is only from 400-409, right? Because after that, the tens digit becomes 10, which is actually 1 in the tens place and 0 in the units. Wait, no, 400-409 is the first ten in the 400s, then 410-419, etc. So, actually, in the 400s, the tens digit 4 occurs only once, from 400-409. So, the number of blocks where the tens digit is 4 is 5: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 400-409. Each of these contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which is only up to 409. Wait, no, 400-409 is still a full block of ten, so it's 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 400-409 is within 488, so that's fine. So, the tens place contributes 50 times the digit 4.\n\nWait, but let me check: 40-49: 10 numbers, 4 in tens place. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: 10. 340-349: 10. 400-409: 10. So that's 5 blocks, each with 10, so 50. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place: Similar to 4's, in each group of ten, the units digit 8 appears once. So, up to 488, how many complete groups of ten are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: hundreds digits can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for each hundreds digit, there's a block where the tens digit is 8. \n\nFor hundreds digit 0: 80-89, which is 10 numbers.\n\nFor hundreds digit 1: 180-189, another 10.\n\nFor hundreds digit 2: 280-289, another 10.\n\nFor hundreds digit 3: 380-389, another 10.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so this block is only from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, in this case, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times.\n\nSo, the number of times 8 appears in the tens place is 4 blocks of 10 (from 0-3 hundreds) plus 9 from the last partial block. So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me confirm: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds place contributes 0 times for the digit 8.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems off because 49 + 49 is 98, but let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So, 98 total 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier, for 4's, I had 188. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recheck the tens place for 8's. The blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, so 4*10=40, and the last block contributes 9, so total 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's, units place was 49, tens place 50, hundreds 89, totaling 188.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nSo, 4's: 188, 8's:98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Let me check again. The tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 400-409. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks *10=50. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, the tens digit occurs 49 times. So, 50 (4's) vs 49 (8's) in the tens place, which is correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when counting the hundreds place for 8's, since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so that's 0. So, 8's total is 49+49=98.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for 8's again. Up to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Each group of ten contributes one 8, so 48 groups (1-480) contribute 48, and then in 481-488, the units digit 8 appears once in 488. So, 48+1=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's, units place: 48 groups (1-480) contribute 48, and in 481-488, 484 has a 4 in the units place, so 48+1=49.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place for 4's, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. So, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188.\n\nSo, 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digit occurrences, it's easy to miscount, especially with the last partial group. Let me try a different approach to verify.\n\nAnother way to count digit occurrences is to consider each digit position separately and calculate how many times each digit appears in that position up to a certain number. So, for the units digit, it's straightforward: for each digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor((n +1)/10) + (if the units digit of n+1 is > d, then 1 else 0). Wait, maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, for any digit d, the count in the units place is (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0).\n\nWait, let's test this with n=488.\n\nFor units digit 4:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in units place: (488 //10) + (1 if (488 %10 >=4) else 0). 488//10=48, 488%10=8, which is >=4, so 48 +1=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in units place: (488//10)=48, and 488%10=8, so 48 +1=49.\n\nNow, for the tens place:\n\nThe formula for the tens digit is a bit more involved. For each digit d, the count is (n // 100) * 10 + something. Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of higher digits.\n\nWait, for the tens digit, the count for digit d is:\n\n- For each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times. So, for each hundred, the digit d appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\n- Then, for the remaining part beyond the last complete hundred, we check how many times d appears in the tens place.\n\nSo, for example, for n=488, the number of hundreds is 4 (since 488 is in the 400s). So, for each hundred from 0 to 3, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, in the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit can be from 0 to 8 (since 488 is 4 8 8). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 400-409: 10 times, and from 410-488, the tens digit is 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear in the tens place beyond 409. So, in the last hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, total for tens digit 4: 4*10 +10=50. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in the tens place:\n\nFor each hundred from 0 to 3, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times each, so 4*10=40.\n\nIn the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit can go up to 8. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? From 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total for tens digit 8: 4*10 +9=49. That's correct.\n\nFor the hundreds digit:\n\nFor digit 4, it appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nFor digit 8, it never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) =188.\n\n8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =98.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the answer might be 90, but I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations. Let me try a smaller example to see if my method works.\n\nLet's say we have a book with 28 pages. How many more 1's are there than 2's?\n\nPage numbers:1-28.\n\nCounting 1's:\n\nUnits place:1,11,21 \u2192 3 times.\n\nTens place:10-19 \u2192 10 times.\n\nHundreds place: none.\n\nTotal 1's:3+10=13.\n\nCounting 2's:\n\nUnits place:2,12,22 \u21923 times.\n\nTens place:20-28 \u21929 times.\n\nHundreds place: none.\n\nTotal 2's:3+9=12.\n\nDifference:13-12=1.\n\nWait, but according to my method, let's see:\n\nUnits digit 1: (28//10)=2, and 28%10=8 >=1, so 2+1=3.\n\nTens digit 1: (28//100)=0, so 0*10 + (if tens digit >=1, which it is in 10-19, so 10 times.\n\nHundreds digit:0.\n\nSo, 3+10=13.\n\nUnits digit 2: (28//10)=2, 28%10=8 >=2, so 2+1=3.\n\nTens digit 2: (28//100)=0, so 0*10 + (tens digit in last partial hundred:20-28, which is 9 times.\n\nSo, 3+9=12.\n\nDifference:13-12=1. That's correct because in page 10-19, there are 10 1's in the tens place, and in 20-28, there are 9 2's in the tens place. So, the method works.\n\nTherefore, applying the same method to the original problem, I can be confident that the difference is 90.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** In every block of 10 numbers, '4' appears once in the units place. There are 48 complete blocks (1-480), contributing 48 '4's.

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. Now, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10 and then a partial group of 8 pages (481-488). So, in each of the 48 full groups, there's one 4 in the units place, giving 48*1=48 fours. In the partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once (page 484). So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for the tens digit, every group of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times. So, in each 100 numbers, there are 10 fours in the tens place. Now, how many full hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, we have four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40 fours. Then, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The fours in the tens place occur in 440-449, which is 10 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the pages 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, each page from 400 onwards has a hundreds digit of 4. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 pages. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the fours: Units (49) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is not that high. Let me check my math again. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is indeed 188, but that seems too high because in each position, the count should be lower. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so each of these contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but 488 is 488, so 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours are 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Hmm, that seems high, but let me check with a smaller number to see if my method is correct. Let's say a book with 100 pages. How many fours? Units: 10 (4,14,...,94), Tens: 10 (40-49), Hundreds: 0. So total 20 fours. Which is correct. So, applying the same method, 488 pages would have 188 fours. Okay, I'll go with that for now.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: Similar to fours, in each group of 10, the units digit is 8 once. So, in 488 pages, there are 48 full groups of 10 and a partial group of 8 pages. So, 48*1=48 eights in the units place. In the partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (page 488). So, total units place eights: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For the tens digit, in each group of 100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each 100 numbers, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, in 488 pages, we have four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40 eights. Then, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The eights in the tens place occur in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0.\n\nAdding up all the eights: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check with the 100-page example again. For 100 pages, units eights: 10 (8,18,...,98), tens eights: 10 (80-89), hundreds: 0. So, total 20 eights, which is correct. So, applying the same method, 488 pages would have 98 eights.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because 188 seems high. Let me recount the fours:\n\nUnits place: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing 1 four, so 48. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), units digit 4 appears once (484). So, 48 +1=49 fours in units.\n\nTens place: Each 100 has 10 fours in the tens place. Four full hundreds: 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 fours. So, 40 +10=50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, each contributing one four in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nTotal fours: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nEights:\n\nUnits place: 48 full groups, 48 eights. Last 8 pages: 488 has units digit 8, so 1 more. Total 49.\n\nTens place: Four full hundreds, 4*10=40. Last partial hundred: 480-488 is 9 pages with tens digit 8. So, 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal eights:49 +49=98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 488 is a three-digit number, and sometimes when counting digits, especially in the hundreds place, it's easy to overcount. Let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. Similarly, for eights, there are none in the hundreds place.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of digits and see if the counts make sense. But maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of each digit position separately and ensure that the counts are correct.\n\nWait, another way to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position is to use the formula where for each digit position, you calculate the higher digits, current digit, and lower digits. But maybe that's more advanced, but let me try it for verification.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: For each complete group of 10, there's one 4. So, floor(488/10)=48 groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the remainder is 8, so in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once. So, total 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: For each complete group of 100, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, floor(488/100)=4 complete groups, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, the remainder is 88 (since 488 - 400=88). So, in the last partial group, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The number of times the tens digit is 4 is when the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers (440-449). Since 440-449 is within 400-488, that's 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's:40 +10=50.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. The number of numbers here is 488 -400 +1=89. So, 89 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 +50 +89=188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of 8's: floor(488/10)=48 groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Remainder is 8, so in the last group, 488 has units digit 8, so 1 more. Total 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of 8's: floor(488/100)=4 complete groups, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Remainder is 88. In the last partial group, the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers). So, 9 eights in the tens place. Total tens place eights:40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNo 8's, as before.\n\nTotal eights:49 +49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit concerned because 188 seems high for 4's. Let me check with a smaller number, say, up to page 50.\n\nFor 50 pages, how many 4's?\n\nUnits place: 5 (4,14,24,34,44). Wait, no, up to 50, units digits go up to 50. So, 4 appears in units place at 4,14,24,34,44. That's 5 times.\n\nTens place: 10-19, 20-29, etc. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 fours in tens place.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal fours:5 +10=15.\n\nSimilarly, eights:\n\nUnits place: 5 (8,18,28,38,48).\n\nTens place: 40-49 is 10, but up to 50, it's 40-49, which is 10 eights in tens place.\n\nWait, but up to 50, the tens digit is 8 only in 40-49? No, wait, 40-49 is tens digit 4, not 8. Wait, no, 40-49 is tens digit 4, and 80-89 would be tens digit 8, but up to 50, the tens digit is 8 only in 80-89, which is beyond 50. So, up to 50, the tens digit is 8 only in 8,18,28,38,48, which are in the units place. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 only when the number is 80-89, but up to 50, that doesn't happen. So, in 1-50, the tens digit is 8 only in 80-89, which is beyond 50, so actually, up to 50, the tens digit is 8 zero times. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, in 1-50, the tens digit can be 0-4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the tens place up to 50. So, eights in tens place:0.\n\nSo, total eights: units place 5 (8,18,28,38,48) and tens place 0, so 5 eights.\n\nSo, fours:15, eights:5. Difference:10.\n\nUsing my earlier method, for 50 pages:\n\nUnits place fours: floor(50/10)=5, remainder 0, so 5.\n\nTens place fours: floor(50/100)=0, but wait, 50 is less than 100, so floor(50/100)=0, so 0*10=0, but in reality, 40-49 is within 1-50, so that's 10 fours in tens place. Wait, so my earlier method may not be accurate for numbers less than 100. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to consider that for each digit position, the count is:\n\nFor units digit: count = higher * 10^power + min(current, 10^power) if current > higher else higher.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to use a standard digit counting formula.\n\nThe formula for counting the number of times a digit d appears in the k-th position (units=0, tens=1, hundreds=2, etc.) in numbers from 1 to n is:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the current digit position as i, starting from 0 for units.\n\n1. higher = n / (10^(i+1))\n2. current = (n / 10^i) % 10\n3. lower = n % 10^i\n\nIf d < current:\ncount = (higher + 1) * 10^i\nelif d == current:\ncount = higher * 10^i + lower + 1\nelse:\ncount = higher * 10^i\n\nBut since we're counting digits from 0 to 9, and we want to count how many times each digit appears, but in this problem, we're only interested in 4 and 8, so d=4 and d=8.\n\nWait, but maybe this is getting too complicated, but let me try applying it for 4's in units place (i=0) for n=488.\n\nFor units digit (i=0), d=4:\n\nhigher = 488 / 10^(0+1) = 488 /10=48\ncurrent = (488 /10^0) %10=488%10=8\nlower =488%10^0=0\n\nSince d=4 < current=8, count = (higher +1)*10^0=49*1=49. Which matches my earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place (i=1), d=4:\n\nhigher =488 /10^(1+1)=488/100=4\ncurrent=(488 /10^1)%10=48%10=8\nlower=488%10^1=8\n\nSince d=4 < current=8, count=(higher +1)*10^1=5*10=50. Which matches.\n\nFor hundreds place (i=2), d=4:\n\nhigher=488 /10^(2+1)=488/1000=0\ncurrent=(488 /10^2)%10=4%10=4\nlower=488%10^2=88\n\nSince d=4 == current=4, count=higher*10^2 + lower +1=0*100 +88 +1=89. Which matches.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place (i=0):\n\nhigher=488/10=48\ncurrent=8\nlower=0\n\nd=8 == current=8, so count=higher*10^0 + lower +1=48*1 +0 +1=49.\n\nFor tens place (i=1), d=8:\n\nhigher=488/100=4\ncurrent=8\nlower=8\n\nd=8 == current=8, so count=4*10 +8 +1=40 +8 +1=49.\n\nFor hundreds place (i=2), d=8:\n\nhigher=0\ncurrent=0 (since 488 /1000=0)\nlower=88\n\nd=8 > current=0, so count=higher*100 + (if d > current, then 10^i else 0)=0*100 +0=0.\n\nSo, total eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, using this formula, I get the same counts as before, which makes me more confident that my initial counts were correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier when I checked with 50 pages, using this formula, for units digit 4, higher=5, current=0 (since 50%10=0), lower=0.\n\nWait, no, wait, for 50 pages, n=50, i=0 (units):\n\nhigher=50/10=5\ncurrent=(50/1)%10=0\nlower=50%1=0\n\nd=4 < current=0? No, because current is 0, and d=4 is greater than 0. So, according to the formula, if d > current, then count=higher*10^i + (if d > current, then 10^i else 0). Wait, maybe I'm misapplying the formula. Let me re-express it.\n\nWait, the formula is:\n\ncount = higher * 10^i\n\nif current > d:\n    count += 10^i\nelif current == d:\n    count += lower + 1\n\nSo, for units digit in 50, d=4:\n\nhigher=5\ncurrent=0\nlower=0\n\nSince current=0 < d=4, so count=higher*1 + (if current < d, then lower +1 if lower >=0 else 0). Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use the formula correctly.\n\nThe standard formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the i-th position (units=0, tens=1, etc.) from 1 to n is:\n\ncount = higher * 10^i\n\nif current > d:\n    count += 10^i\nelif current == d:\n    count += lower + 1\n\nSo, for 50, i=0 (units), d=4:\n\nhigher=50 // 10=5\ncurrent=(50 //1) %10=0\nlower=50 %1=0\n\nSince current=0 < d=4, we don't add anything beyond higher*10^i.\n\nSo, count=5*1=5, which matches the manual count (4,14,24,34,44).\n\nSimilarly, for tens digit in 50, i=1, d=4:\n\nhigher=50 //100=0\ncurrent=(50 //10)%10=5\nlower=50%10=0\n\nSince current=5 > d=4, count=0*10 +10=10, which matches the manual count (40-49).\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nSimilarly, for 50, d=8 in units place:\n\nhigher=5\ncurrent=0\nlower=0\n\ncurrent=0 < d=8, so count=5*1=5, which matches (8,18,28,38,48).\n\nFor tens place, d=8:\n\nhigher=0\ncurrent=5\nlower=0\n\ncurrent=5 > d=8? No, 5 <8, so count=0*10 + (if current <d, then 0). So, count=0.\n\nSo, total eights:5+0=5, which matches.\n\nSo, the formula works correctly.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, I can be confident that the counts are correct: 188 fours and 98 eights, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. When I was counting the hundreds place for fours, I considered all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. But in reality, the hundreds digit is 4 only in 400-488, which is correct. So, that's 89 fours.\n\nSimilarly, for eights, there are none in the hundreds place, so that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate, and the difference is indeed 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, for the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1 to 10, it's 4; from 11 to 20, it's 14; and so on. Now, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). So, in each of these 48 sets, there's one 4 in the units place, totaling 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, the digit 4 appears once more in the units place here. That makes a total of 48 + 1 = 49 times for the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the digit 4 can appear in the tens place. In each set of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4. So, how many complete sets of 100 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 numbers left (401-488). In each complete set of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each hundred. Wait, but 401-488 is part of the 400-499 range, so the tens digit here goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the end). So, the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 440-449. That's another 10 numbers, so 10 times. Therefore, the total for the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 times. So, yes, 40 from the complete hundreds plus 10 from the partial hundred makes 50. So, total 4's in the tens place: 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (400-488 inclusive). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these, so that's 89 times.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me count: 400 to 488 is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let's go through each digit place again.\n\nUnits place: Each 10 numbers contribute 1 four. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the last 8 numbers (481-488) have one more 4 in the units place (484). So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each 100 numbers contribute 10 fours in the tens place. 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, the remaining 88 numbers (401-488) include the 440-449 range, which is 10 fours. So, 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place: In each set of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, for 488 pages, as before, 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. The last 8 numbers (481-488) have one more 8 in the units place (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place: 49.\n\nTens place: In each set of 100 numbers, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place, e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, 4 full hundreds would contribute 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the remaining 88 numbers (401-488). Let's see, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but 480 is in the 400-499 range. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place in 401-488?\n\nWait, 480-488 is part of the 480-488 range, so the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 times. Therefore, the total for the tens place is 40 (from the full hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 10, but now I'm seeing 9. Let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but in the full hundreds, from 1-400, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each hundred contributes 10 times, so 4 hundreds contribute 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but 480 is included in 401-488, right? So, yes, 480 is part of that range. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, tens place: 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0.\n\nTherefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I missed something.\n\nUnits place: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the last 8 numbers (481-488) have one more 8 in the units place (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: Each 100 numbers contribute 10 eights in the tens place. 4 full hundreds contribute 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again about the tens place in 401-488. The numbers where the tens digit is 8 are 480-488, which is 9 numbers, correct? Because 480 is included, and 488 is the last page. So, 480, 481, ..., 488: that's 9 numbers. So, 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my counts again.\n\nWait, 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 49 + 50 = 99 + 89 = 188. Correct.\n\n8's: units 49, tens 49. Total 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again: in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, which is a significant number. That's because from 400-488, every page has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, the hundreds place doesn't contribute anything, so all 8's are in the units and tens places.\n\nWait, but let me think about the tens place again. In the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. But 480 is included, right? So, 480 is part of 401-488, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but wait, 480 is in the 400-499 range, so it's included in 401-488. So, yes, 9 numbers.\n\nWait, but let me check: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49 in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: 49, so total 98.\n\nSo, 4's: 188, 8's: 98. Difference: 90.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a lot. Let me try another approach to verify.\n\nAlternative approach: For each digit position, count the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- For 488 numbers, the number of times 4 appears in units place: floor(488/10) = 48, plus 1 if the remainder is >=4. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. Since 8 >=4, we add 1, so 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: floor(488/10) = 48, and since the remainder is 8 >=8, we add 1, so 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's in tens place: each 100 numbers contribute 10 fours. So, 488 / 100 = 4 full hundreds, contributing 4*10=40. Then, the remaining 88 numbers: the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The number of times 4 appears in the tens place in 401-488 is 10 (from 440-449). So, 40 +10=50.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: each 100 numbers contribute 10 eights. 4 full hundreds contribute 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4's: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nFor 8's: no numbers in the hundreds place are 8, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me think about the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother way: Let's calculate how many 4's and 8's appear in each position.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of 4's: For every 10 numbers, one 4. So, 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, check the last partial ten: 481-488. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once. So, total 49.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: same logic, 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial ten, 488 has an 8, so 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: Each 100 numbers contribute 10 fours in the tens place. So, 488 /100=4.88, so 4 full hundreds, contributing 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 +10=50.\n\nNumber of 8's: Each 100 numbers contribute 10 eights in the tens place. 4 full hundreds contribute 40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNumber of 8's: 0, since we don't reach 800.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in the units place. For every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, from page 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48 full blocks and 8 extra numbers (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8). So, in each of the 48 full blocks, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48*1=48 fours. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 would have a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, let's count the number of 4's in the tens place. Similarly, for every block of 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each hundred. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49 in the first hundred, 140-149 in the second, etc.). How many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, for each of the 4 full hundreds, there are 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40 fours. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each ten. Let's see how many times 4 appears in the tens place here. From 401 to 488, the tens digit is 0 in 401-410, 1 in 411-420, 2 in 421-430, 3 in 431-440, 4 in 441-450, 5 in 451-460, 6 in 461-470, 7 in 471-480, and 8 in 481-488. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the tens digit in 481-488 is 8. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 450 is included, but 451 is beyond 488? No, 450 is within 488. So, from 441 to 450, that's 10 numbers, so another 10 fours. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from the four full hundreds) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50 fours.\n\nWait, but wait a second, 401-488 is 88 numbers, which is 8 full tens (40-49, etc.) but actually, in the hundreds place, it's 4, so the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, right? So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). So, each of these tens digits occurs exactly 10 times, except the last one (481-488) only has 8 numbers. But since we're looking for the tens digit being 4, that occurs in 441-450, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, that's 10 fours. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 4's in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400 to 488. So, 400 is the first, 401, 402,... up to 488. So, that's 89 numbers. So, each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is the sum of 4's in units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. We'll count the number of 8's in units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place: Similar to the 4's, in each block of 10 numbers, the units digit is 8 exactly once. So, from 1 to 488, there are 48 full blocks of 10 (480 numbers) and 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each of the 48 blocks, 1 eight, so 48 eights. In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, 8's in the tens place. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for exactly 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so that's 4*10=40 eights. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Wait, but 480 is included? Wait, 480 is part of the hundreds place as 4, so in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488. But 480 is within 401-488, right? 480 is included. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place in the remaining 88 numbers. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. In 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-488. But 480 is within 401-488, so that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, yes, 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, 8's in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the tens place count. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. But 480 is included, so that's 9 numbers. So, 9 eights in the tens place. So, 40 (from the four hundreds) + 9 = 49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 480 is included in 401-488, so yes, that's correct. So, 9 eights in the tens place from 480-488.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. From 1-488, each block of 10 has one 8 in the units place. So, 48 full blocks give 48 eights, and the last 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, 48 +1=49 units place eights. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, 4 full hundreds give 40 eights, and the remaining 88 numbers (401-488) give 9 eights in the tens place, so 40 +9=49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 +49=98.\n\nNow, total 4's were 188, and total 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the 4's count. Units place:49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. 49+50=99, plus 89=188. That seems correct.\n\nAnd 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours.\n\nWait, but is 400 included? Yes, because page numbers start at 1, so 400 is page 400, which is included. So, 400 to 488 is 89 pages. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 488 -400 +1=89. So, yes, correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for 4's, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, 40 from the four hundreds plus 10=50.\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's, units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0. So, 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I thought about the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, but 480 is included in 401-488, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check: 480 is page 480, which is included in 401-488, so yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n\n- Tens:50\n\n- Hundreds:89\n\nTotal:188.\n\nCounting 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n\n- Tens:49\n\n- Hundreds:0\n\nTotal:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9, with '4' appearing once per cycle.\n     - There are 48 full cycles (480 numbers) and 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n     - In each full cycle: 1 occurrence of '4' in units place.\n     - In the last 8 numbers: '4' appears once (484).\n     - Total units place '4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - For every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each ten, with '4' appearing in 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49).\n     - There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), contributing 10 '4's each: 4 * 10 = 40.\n     - In the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), '4' appears in the tens place in 441-450, which is 10 numbers.\n     - Total tens place '4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - From page 400 to 488, each number has '4' in the hundreds place.\n     - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n     - Total hundreds place '4's: 89.\n\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Similar to '4's, in each block of 10 numbers, '8' appears once.\n     - 48 full cycles contribute 48 '8's.\n     - In the last 8 numbers (481-488), '8' appears once (488).\n     - Total units place '8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - For every 100 numbers, '8' appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 80-89).\n     - 4 full hundreds contribute 4 * 10 = 40 '8's.\n     - In the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), '8' appears in the tens place in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488).\n     - Total tens place '8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - No page numbers have '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n     - Total hundreds place '8's: 0.\n\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 times more than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, etc. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Since each block is 10 numbers, the number of complete blocks is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a block, we'll consider 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times 1 is 48. But wait, the last block isn't complete. From 481 to 488, that's 8 numbers. The units digit in this partial block goes from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once here as well (484). So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for the tens digit, each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in each 100-number block: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many complete 100-number blocks are there in 488? There are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each of the 4 complete blocks, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. That's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the partial block from 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). The tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is only relevant for three-digit numbers. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's see when it's 4. That's from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: Units (49) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours printed.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process, checking each digit place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing one 8. So, 48 times 1 is 48. Then, the last partial block from 481-488 includes 8 in the units place once (488). So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For the tens digit, each 100-number block has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place, such as 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, but 488 is the last page. So, actually, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all those numbers. So, that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for each, so 9 times. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no hundreds digits of 8 in this book. So, hundreds place 8's are 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights printed.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor the 4's:\n- Units: 48 complete blocks (1-480) each contribute 1, so 48. Then 484 is the 49th, so 49.\n- Tens: Each 100 has 10, so 4*10=40. Then in 401-488, the tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. Total 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor the 8's:\n- Units: 48 complete blocks (1-480) each contribute 1, so 48. Then 488 is the 49th, so 49.\n- Tens: Each 100 has 10, so 4*10=40. Then in 401-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for each, so 9. So, total tens 8's: 40+9=49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but when I thought about the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, but actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each of these 48 sets, there's one 4 in the units place, giving 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once more (484). So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for every 100 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for the digit 4, in each 100 numbers, it appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Now, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more numbers (401-488). In each of the 4 complete hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Specifically, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490. Wait, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Therefore, that's another 10 times. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: For the hundreds digit, each digit from 1 to 4 appears in the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (400-488 inclusive). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Hmm, let me check again. Wait, 49 + 50 is indeed 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me think again. Wait, no, actually, when I count the hundreds place, it's only from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. So, total 4's are 188.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9, so 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, in 488 numbers, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, in each 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. Now, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-8. The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, that's 9 times. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit goes from 1 to 4. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3, and 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, so 4's are 188 and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big difference.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's again. Units place: 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus in 481-488, 484 has a 4 in units, so 49. Tens place: Each hundred contributes 10, so 4 hundreds give 40, and in 401-488, 440-449 is 10 more, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4, so 89. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, 8's: Units place: 48 full decades, 48, plus 488, so 49. Tens place: 4 full hundreds give 40, and in 401-488, 480-488 is 9, so 49. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, that's correct. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about page numbers, the hundreds digit is only present from 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, there are no hundreds digits. So, in the 4's count, the hundreds digit starts at 400, which is correct. So, 89 4's there.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. In the remaining 88 numbers after 400, which is 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. But wait, 480 is included in 401-488, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's correct, 9 times. So, 40 from the first 400 pages, plus 9, totaling 49.\n\nWait, but in the first 400 pages, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each 10 numbers, so 4 times 10, which is 40. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up, 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98 8's.\n\nAnd for 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a large number. Let me think differently. Maybe I can write a small program or use another method to verify, but since I can't do that, I'll try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: As calculated, 49 times.\n- Tens place: 50 times.\n- Hundreds place: 89 times.\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49 times.\n- Tens place: 49 times.\n- Hundreds place: 0 times.\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, perhaps that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 times, so 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, 4 hundreds give 40, and in 401-488, 480-488 gives 9, so 49. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place.\n   - 488 / 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 full sets, each contributing 1 \u2192 48.\n   - Remaining 8 numbers (481-488): 484 has a 4 \u2192 1.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers contribute 10 4's in the tens place.\n   - 488 / 100 = 4.88 \u2192 4 full sets, each contributing 10 \u2192 40.\n   - Remaining 88 numbers (401-488): 440-449 contributes 10 \u2192 10.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400-488, 89 numbers have 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 8 in the units place.\n   - 488 / 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 full sets, each contributing 1 \u2192 48.\n   - Remaining 8 numbers (481-488): 488 has an 8 \u2192 1.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers contribute 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - 488 / 100 = 4.88 \u2192 4 full sets, each contributing 10 \u2192 40.\n   - Remaining 88 numbers (401-488): 480-488 contributes 9 \u2192 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"
