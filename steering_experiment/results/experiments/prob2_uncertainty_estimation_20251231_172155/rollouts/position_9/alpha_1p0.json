    "text": " Maybe I should also consider each position one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and a partial set of 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each complete set, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Then, in the partial set (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for the tens digit, every block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). So, each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 in each hundred. Wait, but 401-488 is part of the 400-499 block, right? So, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 in the 400s, which is 10 numbers (400-409). But since we're only going up to 488, it's 400-409 and then 410-488. Wait, no, 400-409 is 10 numbers, but 410-488 is another 79 numbers. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times in 400-409. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, total tens digit 4's would be 40 (from the first 400 pages) plus 10, totaling 50. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check again. Each complete hundred contributes 10 tens place 4's. So, 400-499 would be another 10, but since we only go up to 488, it's still 10 in 400-409, so 40 + 10 = 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's would be units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. Starting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets and a partial set of 8 numbers. So, 48 times in the units place, plus 1 in the partial set (488), so 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place.\n\nTens place: For the tens digit, each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, 4 complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the 400-488 range. So, total tens place 8's would be 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's would be units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. In the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, 40 (from 1-400) + 9 = 49. So, yes, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier, when calculating 4's in the tens place, I had 50. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 complete sets of 10 (1-480) gives 48 4's. Then, 481-488: 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: Each 100 numbers have 10 4's in the tens place. So, 1-100: 40-49: 10. 101-200: 140-149: 10. 201-300: 240-249: 10. 301-400: 340-349: 10. So, that's 4*10=40. Then, 401-488: the tens digit 4 is in 40-49 in the 400s, which is 400-409: 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488: that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 complete sets of 10 (1-480) gives 48 8's. Then, 481-488: 488 is the only one with an 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: Each 100 numbers have 10 8's in the tens place. So, 1-100: 80-89: 10. 101-200: 180-189: 10. 201-300: 280-289: 10. 301-400: 380-389: 10. So, 4*10=40. Then, 401-488: the tens digit 8 is in 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: No 8's, as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I can use a systematic approach for each digit place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such groups are there from 1 to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of ten, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 fours. But wait, the last group goes up to 488, so does that mean there's a 484, which is within the 480-488 range. So, yes, that's correct, 48 fours in the units place.\n\nNow, the tens place: Similarly, for every group of a hundred numbers, the digit 4 appears ten times in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these decades contributes ten 4's in the tens place. Let's see how many such groups there are. From 1-488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. Wait, but 0 would be for the first hundred, which is 1-99, but 0 isn't a hundreds digit. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of hundreds. So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, which is in the first hundred (1-100). Then in 140-149, which is the second hundred, and so on up to 440-449 in the fifth hundred. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the fifth hundred would be 400-488. So, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? Let's see: From 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 fours. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So that's 5 groups of ten, each contributing 10 fours. So 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Hmm, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's okay. So, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check that. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 499, but since our book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me add up the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89). So, 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total number of 4's is 187.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's. I'll go through each digit place again: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, similar to 4's, from 1 to 488, how many groups of ten are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. So, 48 eights in the units place. But wait, does the last group, 480-488, include an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 is the last page, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's correct, 48 eights in the units place.\n\nNow, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in groups like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 group. So, how many such groups are there? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five groups, each contributing ten 8's in the tens place. Wait, but the last group is only 480-488, which is nine numbers, so does that affect the count? Wait, no, because the tens digit is 8 for all numbers from 480-489, but since our book stops at 488, it's 480-488, which is nine numbers, but the tens digit is still 8 for all of them. So, each of these five groups contributes ten 8's in the tens place. Wait, no, because 480-488 is only nine numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for all nine, which is nine 8's, not ten. Hmm, so I think I made a mistake here. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, no, actually, in each group like 80-89, there are ten numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189 has ten numbers, etc. But in the case of 480-488, it's only nine numbers, so only nine 8's in the tens place. So, for the first four groups (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributes ten 8's, and the fifth group (480-488) contributes nine 8's. So, total eights in the tens place would be 4 x 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 80-89: 10 numbers, 8's in tens place: 10. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from page 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total eights: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 97.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Units place: 48, correct. Tens place: 49, correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, total eights: 48 + 49 = 97.\n\nWait, but earlier, when counting fours, I had 187 fours, and eights are 97. So, the difference would be 187 - 97 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFirst, for fours:\n\nUnits place: From 1 to 488, every ten numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times, each contributing one 4. So, 48 fours.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9, so every hundred has a decade where the tens digit is 4, contributing ten 4's. From 1-488, how many such hundreds are there? The hundreds digits can be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). So, that's five hundreds. Each of these contributes ten 4's in the tens place, except maybe the last one. Wait, in the hundreds group 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is ten numbers, so that's okay. So, five groups, each contributing ten 4's, so 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89), each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nNow, for eights:\n\nUnits place: Similar to fours, every ten numbers have one 8 in the units place. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times, each contributing one 8. So, 48 eights.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges has ten numbers, contributing ten 8's each, and the last range (480-488) has nine numbers, contributing nine 8's. So, 4 x 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: As before, no eights in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal eights: 48 + 49 = 97.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count the units place correctly for both 4's and 8's? For units place, both 4's and 8's have 48 each, right? Because from 1 to 488, every ten numbers have one 4 and one 8 in the units place, except maybe the last group if it's incomplete. But 488 is the last page, so the last group is 480-488, which is nine numbers, but since 488 is included, the units digit 8 is present in 488, so that's accounted for in the 48 count.\n\nWait, but 488 is the 48th group of ten, right? Because 48 x 10 = 480, so the 48th group is 480-489, but our book stops at 488, so the units digit 8 in 488 is included in the 48 counts. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, the 4's had five groups contributing ten each, but the 8's had four full groups of ten and one partial group of nine. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. For 4's, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. For 8's, the hundreds digit would be 8 from 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so no 8's in the hundreds place. So, correct.\n\nSo, the total counts are:\n\n4's: 187\n\n8's: 97\n\nDifference: 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems right. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers contribute one '4'. From 1 to 488, there are 48 such groups (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8). Thus, 48 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** Every 100 numbers have a decade (e.g., 40-49) where the tens digit is '4', contributing 10 '4's per decade. There are 5 such decades (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Thus, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400 to 488, there are 89 numbers, each contributing a '4' in the hundreds place. Thus, 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total '4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to '4's, every 10 numbers contribute one '8'. Thus, 48 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The tens digit '8' appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full decades contributing 10 '8's each and one partial decade (480-488) contributing 9 '8's. Thus, 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No '8's since the book ends at 488. Thus, 0 occurrences.\n   - **Total '8's:** 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's - Number of '8's = 187 - 97 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should consider each digit place one by one for both 4 and 8. Let me think about the units place first. For the units digit, how often does 4 appear? Well, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such sets are there in 488 pages? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so no 4 there. So, total 4's in the units place: 48. Now, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit is 4 when the number is between 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within that range. Let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has a decade where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers each. So, from 1-488, how many such blocks are there? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 when the number is between 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, number of 4's in the hundreds place: 89. Wait, but let me check: 400 is the first, then 401, 402,... up to 488. So yes, that's 89 numbers. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 48 + 50 is 98, and 98 + 89 is 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for 8's. Starting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many full sets of 10 are there in 488? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. So, 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Next, the tens place. The tens digit is 8 when the number is between 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the last partial hundred. Let me count each block. Each hundred has a block where the tens digit is 8, which is 10 numbers. So, in 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. Let's see, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 when the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, number of 8's in the hundreds place: 0. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place in the last partial hundred. From 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so each number from 480 to 489 would have an 8 in the tens place, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, that's correct. So, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of 4's was 187, and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place: 48, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. Total: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems right. For 8's: units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. Total: 49+49=98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, but I feel like maybe I missed something, especially in the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. And for 8's, the hundreds place doesn't contribute anything. So, yes, the difference is 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. There are 48 full sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 fours. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) don't add any more fours. Total: 48.\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 4 in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. With 4 full hundreds and an additional 10 in 440-449, total: 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place, totaling 89 fours.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48. The last number, 488, adds one more, making it 49.\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each hundred contributes 10 eights. With 4 full hundreds and 9 in 480-488, total: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have an 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think about each digit place separately because the count can vary based on the position.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, let's see. The total number of pages is 488, so the number of complete groups of 10 is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but we only count complete groups). So, 48 times 1, which is 48. But wait, does 488 have a units digit of 8, so the last group is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but the 4 in the units place would be at 484. So, actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit 4 appears 49 times? Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so the last complete group of 10 would be 480-489, but since we stop at 488, the units digit 4 appears once in each group of 10 up to 480, which is 48 times, and then in 484, which is within 480-488, so that's one more, making it 49 times. Wait, but 488 is page 488, so 480-488 is 9 pages, and 484 is one of them. So yes, 49 times for units digit 4.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10. Then 240-249, another 10. Then 340-349, another 10. Then 440-449, another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. Now, 540 would be beyond 488, so we stop at 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. So 5 times 10 is 50. But wait, does 440-449 include 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 50 times.\n\nWait, but let me check again. From 40-49: 10 numbers, tens digit 4. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place. The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers, so similar to the 4's, but let's confirm. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? The first occurrence is at 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is 488. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? It's an arithmetic sequence starting at 8, ending at 488, with a common difference of 10. The nth term is given by a_n = 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488. Subtract 8: 10(n-1)=480. Divide by 10: n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 8,18,...,488. So, 488 is the 49th term because (488-8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So yes, 49 times.\n\nNow, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them. So, let's count how many blocks there are. Each block is 10 numbers except possibly the last one.\n\nFirst block: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times the digit 8 in the tens place.\n\nSecond block: 180-189: another 10.\n\nThird block: 280-289: another 10.\n\nFourth block: 380-389: another 10.\n\nFifth block: 480-488: 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49 times.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me see: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is never 8. So, zero times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98.\n\nWait, but earlier, when counting 4's, I had 188. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my counting.\n\nLet me recheck the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49 times.\n\nTens place: 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nTotal:49+50+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49 times.\n\nTens place: 5 blocks, but the last block is only 9 numbers, so 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, so 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 full blocks and one partial block. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, yes, 49 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, units place:49.\n\nSo, total 8's:98.\n\nTherefore, 4's:188, 8's:98, difference:90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the hundreds place for 4's was 89, but let me confirm. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nWait, but in the 4's count, I added 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. That seems correct.\n\nIn the 8's count, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, total 98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. I had 5 blocks: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place for 4's, from 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484, which is 480+4. So, (484-4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place one by one for both 4 and 8. \n\nStarting with the units place for 4's: In the numbers 1 to 488, how often does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such sets are there? Since the book has 488 pages, the last set would be 481-490, but 488 is the last page, so actually, it's 481-488. Wait, maybe I should calculate it differently. The total number of units digits cycles can be found by dividing 488 by 10, which gives 48 full cycles (since 48*10=480) and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full cycle of 10, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484). So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place for 4's: Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 full blocks (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-499). Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so the last block is 400-488. So, in each of the first four blocks (100s, 200s, 300s, 400s), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each. So that's 4*10=40 times. Now, in the last partial block (400-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (440-449). So, total 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, total 4's in tens place: 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place for 4's: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: Units (49) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's printed are 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again.\n\nStarting with units place for 8's: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, total number of full cycles is 488 divided by 10, which is 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8. Then, the extra 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place for 8's: The tens digit is 8 in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Each full block of 100 contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, how many full blocks are there? Up to 400, there are four blocks: 100s, 200s, 300s, 400s. But wait, 480-488 is within the 400s block. So, in each of the first three blocks (100s, 200s, 300s), there's one block where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289. Each contributes 10 numbers, so that's 3*10=30. Then, in the 400s block, the tens digit is 8 from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 30 + 9 = 39. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. So, total 8's in tens place: 39.\n\nHundreds place for 8's: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 times.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: Units (49) + Tens (39) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 39 = 88.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 88 (number of 8's) = 100.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 full cycles (1-480) gives 48, plus 484, so 49. Correct.\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds (1-400) each have 10 numbers, so 4*10=40, plus 440-449 (10 numbers), so 50. Correct.\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89. Correct. Total 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 full cycles (1-480) gives 48, plus 488, so 49. Correct.\n- Tens: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289 each give 10, so 30, plus 480-488 gives 9, so 39. Correct.\n- Hundreds: 0. Correct. Total 8's: 49+39=88.\n\nDifference: 188-88=100. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 100 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 88. Subtracting, we find 188 - 88 = 100.\n\n$\\boxed{100}$"

How many such sets are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last set is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the units digit 4 appears in 484, which is within the range. So, 48 times in the units place. Now, for the tens place. Every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times. So, in each 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). How many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each of these 4 hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. That's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 0-8. So, does 4 appear in the tens place here? Yes, from 440-449. That's another 10 times. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 times. Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times. Therefore, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. Starting with the units place. Similar to 4, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. That's 48 times. But wait, the last page is 488, so the units digit 8 appears in 488, which is within the range. So, 48 times in the units place. Now, the tens place. Every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times. So, in each 100, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 full hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 0-8, so 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but actually, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more times. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 times. Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens: 48 + 49 = 97. Now, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 97 = 90.

Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each of those 48 sets, the units digit is 4 once, so that's 48 times.

Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. Now, 400-488: 440-449 is another set, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 numbers. So how many sets is that? Let's count: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, so that's fine. So total tens place 4's: 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 in the hundreds place occurs in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds place.\n\nUnits place: Similar to the 4's, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing 1 unit place 8, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is within 488, so let's see. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers except maybe the last one. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189 is another 10. 200-299: 280-289, another 10. 300-399: 380-389, another 10. 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, how many 8's? Each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, etc.) contribute 10 each, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 contributes 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (since 480 has 8 in tens, 481, etc., up to 488). So that's 9 more. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to miscount.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 sets of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 484 has a 4 in units, so +1, total 49.\n- Tens: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 sets of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus in the last 8 numbers, 488 has an 8 in units, so +1, total 49.\n- Tens: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each 10, so 4*10=40. Then 480-488 is 9 numbers, so +9, total 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90. So, the final answer is \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Maybe I should start with the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. Similarly, for the tens place, every block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, for the hundreds place, in a 1000-page book, each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) would have 100 occurrences of each digit in the hundreds place, but since we only go up to 488, I need to adjust that. Wait, maybe I should handle each place separately. Let me start with the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, there's one 4. So, how many tens are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full tens and then 8 extra numbers. So, in each of these 48 tens, there's one 4, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more in 484. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Now, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, 4 appears in blocks of 100. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many such blocks are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds and then 88 extra pages. So, in each of these 4 full hundreds, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (from 400-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. Now, for the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, so 89 occurrences. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, plus one more in 484, so 49. Tens: 4 full hundreds (1-400) each have 10 numbers with tens digit 4, so 4*10=40, plus in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 40 + 10=50. Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89. So, 49+50=99, plus 89=188. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. Units place: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, one 8. From 1 to 488, how many full tens? 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1=49. Tens place: In the tens digit, 8 appears in blocks of 100. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. How many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-400). Each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9=49. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: Units: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total 188. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total 98. Difference:90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check that again. From 400-488, how many numbers? 488-400+1=89. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these 89 numbers, so 89. That seems right. For the tens place, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. Units place: 48 full tens, each with one 4, plus one more in 484, so 49. For 8's: Units place: 48 full tens, each with one 8, plus one more in 488, so 49. Tens place: 4 full hundreds, each with 10 8's, so 40, plus in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, total 49. So, 49+49=98. So, yes, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 4 appears once (484).\n   - **Total in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).\n   - There are 4 full hundreds, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 occurrences.\n   - In the remaining 88 numbers (400-488), 4 appears in 440-449, contributing 10 occurrences.\n   - **Total in tens place:** 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full sets of 10, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 8 appears once (488).\n   - **Total in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89).\n   - There are 4 full hundreds, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 occurrences.\n   - In the remaining 88 numbers (400-488), 8 appears in 480-488, contributing 9 occurrences.\n   - **Total in tens place:** 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8 (since the book ends at 488).\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each place value one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives me 48 fours. But wait, the last group is 481-488, which has 488, so I need to check if there's an extra 4 in the units place beyond the 48 groups. The last number is 488, which ends with an 8, so no extra 4 in the units place. So, units place gives me 48 fours.\n\nNext, the tens place: Here, the digit 4 appears in a block of 10 numbers. For example, in 40-49, each number has a 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there in 488? Well, each block is 10 numbers, so from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 count? Since 488 is the last page, 440-449 is within 488, so yes. Let me count these blocks: 40-49 is one, 140-149 is two, 240-249 is three, 340-349 is four, and 440-449 is five. So, that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is from 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers, but 449 is within 488, so yes, it's valid. So, 50 fours from the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total fours are 187.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with units place: Similar to fours, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. So, 48 eights. But wait, the last group is 481-488, which includes 488. So, in the units place of this last group, 488 has an 8, so that's an extra 8. So, total units place eights are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Let me count how many such blocks there are. 80-89 is one, 180-189 is two, 280-289 is three, 380-389 is four, and 480-488 is five. So, five blocks. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, each block contributes 10 eights except the last one, which contributes 9. So, let's recalculate.\n\nFirst, 80-89: 10 eights in the tens place.\n180-189: another 10.\n280-289: another 10.\n380-389: another 10.\n480-488: 9 eights because it's only 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total eights in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought of it as five blocks, each contributing 10, but the last one only contributes 9. So, 4 blocks \u00d710 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because when I counted the fours, I had 187 fours, and eights as 98. So, the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89. But let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nWait, let me go back to the units place for eights. I had 488 divided by 10, which is 48 groups, each contributing one 8, and then the last group (481-488) has 488, which is an 8 in the units place. So, units place eights: 48 +1=49. That seems correct.\n\nFor the tens place, I had five blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last contributes 9. So, 4\u00d710=40 +9=49. So, total eights in tens place:49. So, total eights:49+49=98.\n\nWait, but when I counted fours, I had 187, so 187 fours and 98 eights, so the difference is 187-98=89. Hmm, but let me check if I counted correctly for fours.\n\nFor fours: units place:48, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. So, 48+50=98, plus 89=187. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for fours, I had five blocks:40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50 fours. Correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place for fours, from 400-488:488-400+1=89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Correct.\n\nSo, fours total:187.\n\nEights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0, total=98.\n\nSo, difference is 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for fours. When I count 440-449, that's within 488, so that's correct. And for eights, 480-488 is correct as well.\n\nWait, another way to check: maybe using a formula or another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10)=48, plus if the last digit is >=4, but since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is greater than 4, so we add 1 more if the units digit is >=4. Wait, no, actually, the formula is a bit different. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is:\n\nnumber = n // 10 * 1 + min(max(n % 10 - d + 1, 0), 10)\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think as:\n\nFor units digit, the number of 4's is the number of complete decades (each 10 numbers) times 1, plus 1 if the units digit of n is >=4.\n\nSo, 488//10=48, and 488%10=8 >=4, so 48+1=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Wait, no, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct this.\n\nWait, when counting the number of 4's in the units place, it's actually the number of times 4 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488.\n\nSo, for every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 488//10=48 complete decades, each contributing one 4, so 48\u00d71=48. Now, in the incomplete decade (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (at 484). So, total units place 4's:48+1=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place fours were 48, but now I'm seeing it's 49. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Let me check this again.\n\nWait, 1-10: 4 appears once (at 4).\n11-20: once (14).\n...\n481-488: once (484).\n\nSo, from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's 48 times for the complete decades (1-480), and one more in 481-488 (484), so total 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48. So, I must have made a mistake earlier. So, units place fours:49, not 48.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in units place: same calculation. 488//10=48, and 488%10=8 >=8, so 48+1=49. So, units place eights:49.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier in counting fours in the units place. It's actually 49, not 48.\n\nLet me correct that.\n\nSo, for fours:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place: Let's recalculate.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there?\n\nFrom 40-49:10 numbers\n140-149:10\n240-249:10\n340-349:10\n440-449:10\n\nWait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's five blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5\u00d710=50.\n\nBut wait, from 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 another 10, etc., up to 440-449. So, that's five blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours.\n\nSo, total fours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =49+50=99, plus 89=188.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 187, but now it's 188. So, I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nUnits place:49\nTens place:50\nHundreds place:89\nTotal fours:49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, for eights:\n\nUnits place:49\nTens place: Let's recalculate.\n\nIn the tens place, 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers:\n\n80-89:10\n180-189:10\n280-289:10\n380-389:10\n480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers)\n\nSo, 4 blocks of 10, and one block of 9.\n\nSo, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49.\n\nHundreds place:0, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) =98.\n\nSo, fours total:188, eights total:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, in the units place for fours, I corrected it to 49, which was a mistake earlier. So, fours total is now 188, eights total is 98, so difference is 90.\n\nWait, let me check again.\n\nUnits place fours:49\n\nTens place fours:50\n\nHundreds place fours:89\n\nTotal fours:49+50=99+89=188.\n\nUnits place eights:49\n\nTens place eights:49\n\nHundreds place eights:0\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, so the correct answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for fours again. From 40-49:10 numbers, so 10 fours in tens place.\n\nSimilarly, 140-149:10 fours.\n\n240-249:10 fours.\n\n340-349:10 fours.\n\n440-449:10 fours.\n\nThat's five blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 50.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in tens place, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 49.\n\nSo, I think the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89, but that was because I had miscalculated the units place fours as 48 instead of 49. So, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when counting units place fours, from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units digit?\n\nIt's once every 10 numbers, so 488//10=48, and since the last digit is 8 >=4, we add 1 more, so 48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units place.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in units place, same calculation:48+1=49.\n\nSo, units place: fours=49, eights=49.\n\nTens place: fours=50, eights=49.\n\nHundreds place: fours=89, eights=0.\n\nSo, total fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal eights:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought it was 89, but after correcting the units place fours, it's 90. Let me confirm with a different approach.\n\nAnother way to calculate the number of times a digit appears is to consider each digit position separately and calculate how many times the digit appears in that position from 1 to n.\n\nFor a three-digit number, we can consider hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nLet me formalize the calculation:\n\nFor a given digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to n is:\n\ncount_units = (n // 10) * 1 + min(max(n % 10 - d + 1, 0), 1)\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nThe number of times digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is:\n\ncount_units = (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10 >= d) else 0)\n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Let me think with an example.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488//10=48 full decades, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the incomplete decade (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484). So, total 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in units place:488//10=48, and since 8 <=8, we add 1, so 48+1=49.\n\nSo, units place: fours=49, eights=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor digit d in tens place, the count is:\n\ncount_tens = (n // 100) * 10 + extra\n\nWhere extra depends on the tens digit.\n\nWait, perhaps a better formula is:\n\nFor each position, calculate how many times the digit appears.\n\nFor the tens place, the number of times digit d appears is:\n\ncount_tens = (n // 100) * 10 + (if the tens digit of n is >d, add 10; if it's ==d, add (n % 10 + 1); else 0)\n\nWait, let me apply this to fours in tens place.\n\nn=488.\n\nFor fours in tens place:\n\nFirst, divide n by 100:488//100=4.\n\nSo, 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4\u00d710=40.\n\nNow, look at the tens digit of n:488 has tens digit 8.\n\nSince 8 >4, we add another 10 fours (from 440-449). So, total fours in tens place:40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in tens place:\n\nn=488.\n\nn//100=4.\n\nSo, 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4\u00d710=40.\n\nNow, the tens digit of n is 8, which is equal to d=8.\n\nSo, we add (n % 100) +1 if d is in the tens place. Wait, no, more accurately, if the tens digit is >=d, but since we're dealing with exact digit, we need to check if the tens digit is exactly d, then add the units digits +1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that if the tens digit is greater than d, add 10; if equal, add (units digit +1); else, add 0.\n\nSo, for eights in tens place:\n\nn=488, tens digit=8, which is equal to d=8.\n\nSo, add (8 +1)=9? Wait, no, because n=488, the tens digit is 8, so the numbers contributing to eights in tens place are from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, units digits go from 0 to8, which is 9 numbers. So, we add 9.\n\nSo, total eights in tens place:4\u00d710=40 +9=49.\n\nSimilarly, for fours in tens place, since the tens digit of n=488 is 8>4, we add another 10, so 4\u00d710=40 +10=50.\n\nSo, that confirms that fours in tens place:50, eights in tens place:49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor fours in hundreds place:\n\nn=488.\n\nThe hundreds digit is 4.\n\nSo, numbers from 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNumber of such numbers:488-400+1=89.\n\nSo, fours in hundreds place:89.\n\nFor eights in hundreds place:\n\nNumbers from 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but since n=488<800, there are 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, eights in hundreds place:0.\n\nAdding up:\n\nFours:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:50\n\nHundreds:89\n\nTotal:49+50=99+89=188.\n\nEights:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:49\n\nHundreds:0\n\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n\nI think I've double-checked all the steps, so I'm confident the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 complete groups of 10 in 488, contributing 48 fours. Additionally, in the last partial group (481-488), 484 has a 4 in the units place, adding 1 more. Total units place fours: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are five such blocks up to 440-449, each contributing 10 fours. Total tens place fours: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From page 400 to 488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place. There are 89 such numbers. Total hundreds place fours: 89.\n   - **Total Fours:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 complete groups of 10, contributing 48 eights. Additionally, 488 has an 8 in the units place, adding 1 more. Total units place eights: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are four complete blocks, each contributing 10 eights, and the last partial block (480-488) contributes 9 eights. Total tens place eights: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488. Total hundreds place eights: 0.\n   - **Total Eights:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - **Difference:** Total fours (188) - Total eights (98) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe digit 4 is printed 90 more times than the digit 8 in the page numbers of the book.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe it's better to consider each digit place one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. Now, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of ten and then an extra 8 pages. Each full set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once in 484. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all ten numbers. Similarly, this happens every hundred numbers. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see, the first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 instances of the digit 4 in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 count as a full block? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the 4's: Units place (49) + Tens place (50) + Hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, every set of ten numbers has exactly one 8 in the units place. So, 48 full sets of ten, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for ten numbers each time, like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would be another block, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. So, that's 9 numbers (480-488) instead of 10. So, how many blocks? Let's see: 80-89 is one block (10 numbers), 180-189 is another, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? The blocks are:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the 8's: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in 481-488, units digit 4 appears once (484). So, 49.\n- Tens: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10, so 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in 481-488, units digit 8 appears once (488). So, 49.\n- Tens: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last contributes 9. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49 +49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 sets of ten (1-480) contribute 48, plus one in 484 \u2192 49.\n- **Tens place:** Five blocks (40-49, etc.) contribute 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 contribute 89.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 sets of ten contribute 48, plus one in 488 \u2192 49.\n- **Tens place:** Five blocks contribute 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place one by one.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in the units place. For every group of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10 and then 8 extra pages. Each full group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, the last group is from 481 to 488, which includes 484, so that's another 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. Actually, from 1 to 488, the number of times the units digit is 4 is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus one if the last number is in the units place. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means 48 full decades and then 8 numbers in the 488th decade. So, in each full decade, there's one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. Then, in the last partial decade (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 is within this range, so that's one more 4. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, let's count the number of 4's in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? 449 is less than 488, so yes. So, that's 50 4's in the tens place. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within the book's pages. Since the book goes up to 488, 449 is included, so yes, all five ranges are valid. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but actually, let me correct that. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 499, but since our book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is the sum of units, tens, and hundreds place counts. That would be 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Wait, let me add that again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process: units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place: similar to 4's, for every group of 10, the units digit is 8 once. From 1 to 488, how many full groups of 10 are there? 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, tens place: the tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit being 8. Each full range (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are up to 488. The first is 80-89, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 is the next range, but our book stops at 488, so the last range is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) are complete, each with 10 numbers, contributing 10 8's each. The last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 4 x 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. The ranges are:\n\n1. 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 8's.\n2. 180-189: 10 numbers, 10 8's.\n3. 280-289: 10 numbers, 10 8's.\n4. 380-389: 10 numbers, 10 8's.\n5. 480-488: 9 numbers, 9 8's.\n\nSo, that's 4 full ranges and one partial. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, hundreds place: the hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens:49, so total 98 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I counted 4's, I had 188. So, 188 4's minus 98 8's equals 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me go through the units place again for 8's. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? For every 10 numbers, it's once. So, 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial decade, 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 has an 8. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nFor the tens place, as I thought earlier, 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributing 10 8's, and 480-488 contributing 9. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 in the tens place. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nAnd 4's: units (49), tens (50), hundreds (89). So, 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 4's. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I counted the tens place for 4's, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges x 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: 49, as we calculated. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nAnd for 8's, units:49, tens:49, so 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 numbers, so 4 x 10 = 40. The last range, 480-488, is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? It's the same as the number of times the tens digit is 8. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers. So, in 488 pages, there are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 4 x 10 = 40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, it's 5 ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each with 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. Since 440-449 is within 488, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I think about the hundreds place for 8's, since our book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's there.\n\nSo, I think my counts are correct. Therefore, the difference is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full decades (480 numbers) and one partial decade (481-488), contributing 48 + 1 = 49 4's.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each of the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, totaling 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 4's.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, contributing 89 4's.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full decades and one partial decade (481-488), contributing 48 + 1 = 49 8's.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each of the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 9 numbers in 480-488, totaling 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 8's.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each place value one by one.\n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. For every set of ten numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and then a partial set of 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each complete set of ten, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48 sets mean 48 times 1, which is 48. Then, in the partial set from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, 484 ends with 4, so that's another one. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are four complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial hundred from 401-488. Each complete hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds times 10 gives 40. Now, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 8 for 480-488. Wait, does the tens digit ever reach 4 in this partial hundred? Let me check. 401-410: tens digit is 0. 410-420: tens digit is 1. 420-430: tens digit is 2. 430-440: tens digit is 3. 440-450: tens digit is 4. Oh, right, so from 440-449, the tens digit is 4. That's another 10 numbers. So, the partial hundred adds 10 more. So, total 4's in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences of 4.\n\nAdding up the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488, which is indeed 89 pages. So, 89 is correct. Units place: 48 complete tens, each contributing 1, plus 1 more in 484, so 49. Tens place: 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40, plus 10 in the 440-449 range, so 50. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. As before, each set of ten has one 8 in the units place, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many complete tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the partial set 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 is present once (488). So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each hundred has 10 such numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, how many hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds. Each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Now, the partial hundred from 401-488: the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 4's are 188 and 8's are 98, so the difference would be 90. But let me double-check my counts because maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's. Units place: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units digit? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 484 has a 4, so one more, making 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in the partial hundred, 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10, making 50. So, 50 in tens place.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's: units place, same as 4's, 49. Tens place: each hundred has 10, so 4 hundreds give 40, plus in the partial hundred, 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any numbers or miss any edge cases. For example, in the units place, when I counted up to 488, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, so that's included. Similarly, in the tens place, 480-488 is correctly accounted for. And the hundreds place for 4's is correctly from 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 fours. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include one more 4 (484), totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100. Four complete hundreds contribute 40 fours. The partial hundred (401-488) includes 440-449, adding 10 fours, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, totaling 89 fours.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100. Four complete hundreds contribute 40 eights. The partial hundred (401-488) includes 480-488, adding 9 eights, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's (188) minus number of 8's (98) equals 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each position one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 pages, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive pages, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, pages 4, 14, 24, etc. How many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 pages and then 8 extra pages. So, in each of these 48 sets, there's one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 occurrences. Now, the last 8 pages would be 481 to 488. The units digits here are 1 to 8, so no 4 in the units place in this partial set. So, total 4's in the units place: 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 4 in pages 40-49, which is 10 pages. So, every 100 pages, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many full hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so it's 4 full hundreds and then 88 pages. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages, so 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 occurrences. Now, in the last 88 pages (from 401 to 488), the tens digit is 4 in pages 440-449 and 480-489, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 480-488. Let me check: from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449 and 480-488. So, 440-449 is 10 pages, and 480-488 is 9 pages. So, that's 10 + 9 = 19 occurrences. Wait, but actually, when considering the tens place, from 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 in each hundred. So, in 401-499, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (440-449). But since we only go up to 488, the next set where tens digit is 4 is 480-489, but we stop at 488, so that's 9 pages (480-488). So, in the last 88 pages, the tens digit is 4 for 10 + 9 = 19 times. Wait, but I think I might be overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The total number of times the tens digit is 4 is the number of hundreds times 10, plus any extra in the last partial hundred. So, 4 full hundreds give 4*10=40. Then, in the last 88 pages, which is from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the 440-449 range (10 pages) and 480-488 (9 pages). So, that's 10+9=19. Therefore, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 19 = 59.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I'm adding correctly. Let me verify. From 1-100, tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (40-49). Similarly, 101-200: 140-149, another 10. 201-300: 240-249, 10. 301-400: 340-349, 10. Then, 401-488: 440-449 (10) and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4*10=40 plus 10+9=19, total 59. Okay, that seems right.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 in pages 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400 is the first page with hundreds digit 4, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, yes, 89 occurrences.\n\nNow, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 59 + 89. Let me add these up. 48 + 59 is 107, and 107 + 89 is 196. So, 196 occurrences of the digit 4.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, every 10 pages, the units digit is 8 once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48 occurrences. The last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 8 is present once (page 488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 pages. How many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 occurrences, so 4*10=40. Now, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 pages (480-488). So, in the last partial hundred, 9 occurrences. Therefore, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 1-100, tens digit 8 is 80-89, 10 pages. Similarly, 101-200: 180-189, 10. 201-300: 280-289, 10. 301-400: 380-389, 10. Then, 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 4*10=40 plus 9=49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nTherefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98. Hmm, but earlier I thought the units place was 49, which is 48 from the full sets and 1 from the last partial set. Tens place is 49 as well. So, total 98 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about the units place, from 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 pages, so 48 full sets of 10 (48*10=480 pages), each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) include page 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, 48+1=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, in each hundred, 10 occurrences, 4 hundreds give 40, and in the last 88 pages, 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 more. So, 40+9=49. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the 4's were 196 and 8's are 98, so the difference would be 196-98=98. But wait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in counting the 4's in the tens place. Let me go back.\n\nWhen counting the tens place for 4's, I considered that in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages. So, 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449 (10 pages) and 480-488 (9 pages). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit in 480-488 is 8, not 4. Wait, no, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, right? Because 480 is 4 8 0, so tens digit is 8. Wait, so I think I made a mistake here. The tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 pages, and in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, not 4. So, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, that's 10 occurrences, not 19. Therefore, total tens place 4's: 4*10=40 (from the full hundreds) plus 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n\nWait, but then I had earlier thought it was 19, which was wrong. So, let me correct that.\n\nSo, units place: 48.\n\nTens place: 40 (from full hundreds) +10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n\nHundreds place: 89 (from 400-488).\n\nSo, total 4's: 48+50+89= 48+50=98, 98+89=187.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier count. So, earlier I thought 196, but now I'm getting 187. I must have made a mistake in the tens place earlier.\n\nWait, let me re-examine. So, in the tens place, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages. So, 4 hundreds: 4*10=40.\n\nThen, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 10 more. So, total tens place 4's: 40+10=50.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187.\n\nNow, for 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. So, total 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 187-98=89.\n\nWait, so 89 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, that seems more plausible than 98. Let me check again.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's in the tens place. From 1-100: 40-49, 10 pages. 101-200:140-149, 10. 201-300:240-249,10. 301-400:340-349,10. That's 4*10=40.\n\nThen, from 401-488: the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 40+10=50.\n\nUnits place: 48.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89.\n\nSo, 48+50=98, 98+89=187.\n\n8's: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds 0. So, 98.\n\nDifference: 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 196, but that was wrong because I mistakenly included 480-488 as tens digit 4, which is incorrect. So, the correct count is 187 4's and 98 8's, difference 89.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because I thought the hundreds place for 4's was 89, which is correct because from 400-488, that's 89 pages. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nLet me check another way: total number of digits. From 1-9: 9 pages, 1 digit each: 9 digits. 10-99: 90 pages, 2 digits each: 180 digits. 100-488: 389 pages, 3 digits each: 1167 digits. Total digits: 9+180+1167=1356 digits.\n\nBut maybe that's not necessary. Alternatively, perhaps I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each position again.\n\nWait, another approach: For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), count the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place: floor(488/10)=48 full cycles, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, check if the last partial cycle (481-488) has a 4 in units place. 481-488: units digits 1-8, so no 4. So, total 48.\n\nNumber of 8's in units place: floor(488/10)=48, plus if the last partial cycle (481-488) has an 8, which it does (488). So, 48+1=49.\n\nTens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's in tens place: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so in each hundred, 10 times. There are floor(488/100)=4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 40+10=50.\n\nNumber of 8's in tens place: Similarly, each hundred contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds digit:\n\nNumber of 4's in hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89.\n\nNumber of 8's in hundreds place: From 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=187.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:187-98=89.\n\nSo, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is 187, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can think about each digit place separately because the number of times a digit appears can vary depending on the place. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full set, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear there. So, total 4's in the units place: 48.\n\nNow, moving to the tens place: Similarly, every 100 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the digit 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 times. So, how many full hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these will have 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens place goes from 0 to 8. So, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 for numbers 440-449, which is 10 times. But wait, our range is only up to 488, so 440-449 is within that range. So, that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50.\n\nWait, but hold on. From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that adds 10 more, making it 40 + 10 = 50. Okay, so tens place gives us 50 4's.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me double-check that. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process, checking each digit place.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers, each digit appears once. So, from 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then, the extra 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in the units place (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, in each full hundred (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.), the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89). There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). So, 4 * 10 = 40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, hold on, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, yes, 9.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's correct. So, 40 from the full hundreds and 9 from the last partial hundred, totaling 49.\n\nSo, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, so 98 8's in total.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 4's there. Then, in the tens place, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, in the tens place, I think I might have miscalculated earlier. Let me recount.\n\nIn the tens place for 4's: For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 once every 100 numbers. So, in 1-100, it's 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10, and so on. So, for 4 full hundreds (1-400), that's 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, 40 + 10 = 50, which matches what I had before. So, 50 in tens place.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48 times as before.\n\nHundreds place: 89 times.\n\nSo, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's: Units place is 49, tens place is 49, so 98 total.\n\n187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check the units place for 8's again. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in 488 numbers, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's the number of times 8 is the last digit. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms are there? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, that's correct, 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, 8's appear in 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each hundred has 10 occurrences. From 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more, totaling 49. That's correct.\n\nSo, yes, 98 8's.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 187, and 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me just check once more to make sure I didn't miss anything. Maybe I can think of a different approach, like considering each digit position separately for 4's and 8's.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) = 48 (since 48*10=480, and 480+8=488). Plus, if the last number is 488, which ends with 8, so the 48th set ends at 480, and then from 481-488, no additional 4's in units place. So, 48.\n\nNumber of 8's: Similarly, floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 is included, the units digit 8 appears one more time, so 49.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100) = 4 (since 4*100=400). Each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, total 50.\n\nNumber of 8's: floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 49.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: 1 if the number is between 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nNumber of 8's: 0, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is 187, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Maybe it's easier to count each digit place one by one.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in the units place. For every set of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of ten and then an extra 8 numbers. But since we're only looking for 4's in the units place, each full set contributes one 4. So, 48 sets give us 48 fours. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. 484 is within this range, so that's another 4. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, let's count the number of 4's in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? From 0-488, we have 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five ranges. Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). In each of these, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 fours. So, total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\nWait, but hold on, does 400-488 include 489? No, because the book only goes up to 488. So, 400-488 is correct, giving 89 numbers. So, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I need to count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places from 1 to 488.\n\nStarting with the units place: similar to the 4's, every set of ten numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full tens are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. That's 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit is 1-8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's another 1. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, since 489 is beyond 488). So, the first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last one contributes 9. So, total 8's in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check. 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, so 49 + 49 is 98. So, 98 eights in total.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nFirst, for the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full tens (1-480), each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, 484 is within 481-488, so that's one more, total 49. That seems right.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's five sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so one more, total 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: None, since the book ends at 488. So, 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the tens place for 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but does each of those have an 8 in the tens place? Let's see: 480, 481, ..., 488. The tens digit is 8 for all of these, so yes, 9 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nI think my counting is accurate. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** Every 10 numbers contribute one 4. There are 48 full sets of 10 (1-480), contributing 48 fours. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 484, adding one more. Total: 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449 each contribute 10 fours. Total: 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488 contributes 89 fours. Total: 89.\n   \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 48 full sets contribute 48 eights, plus 488 adds one more. Total: 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 each contribute 10 eights, and 480-488 contributes 9. Total: 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place. Total: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each place value one by one. Let's start with the units place. For the units digit, how often does 4 appear? Well, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, it's page 4; from 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Let me calculate that. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and a partial block of 8 numbers. Each complete block contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, the partial block from 481 to 488: the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is the only page number in this range where the units digit is 4. So that's one more 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Now, moving on to the tens place. The digit 4 in the tens place appears in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, every page number has a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 times. Similarly, from 140-149, another 10 times, and so on. Let me figure out how many such blocks there are up to 488. The first block is 40-49, the next is 140-149, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? So that's five blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does the last block go up to 449? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place. Now, what about the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 for page numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me check: 400 to 488 is indeed 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, and adding 1 gives 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, I need to count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Let me do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. Starting with the units place. Similar to 4's, in each block of 10, 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488? 48 blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the partial block from 481-488: the units digits are 1-8, so 488 is the only number with an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Now, the tens place. The digit 8 in the tens place appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's. Similarly, 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. And 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, how many 8's in the tens place? Let's calculate: first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40. The last block, 480-488, contributes 9 8's in the tens place (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** In every block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. With 48 complete blocks (480 numbers) and one partial block (481-488), we get 48 + 1 = 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are five such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), contributing 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears once in every block of 10. With 48 complete blocks and one partial block, we get 48 + 1 = 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are four complete blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 occurrences, and the partial block 480-488 contributes 9 occurrences. Total = 40 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place one by one.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so the digit 4 appears once in the units place every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers. So, in each block, the units digit is 4 once, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, from 140-149, and so on. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see: the first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks times 10 equals 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 minus 400 plus 1 is 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers, meaning 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, but I should check if 488 is included. Yes, because 488 is page 488, so the hundreds digit is 4, so that's correct.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, there are 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. As before, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete blocks of 10, as before, plus 8 extra numbers. So, in each block, the units digit is 8 once, so 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once here as well. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers instead of 10. So, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 5 blocks, but the last one has only 9 numbers. Now, how many 8's in the tens place? Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's, so 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. The last block, 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers, so that's 9 more. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's here.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems off because earlier I thought the tens place for 8's was 49, but let me double-check. Wait, when I was counting the tens place for 8's, I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. So, yes, 49 8's in the tens place. And units place was 49, so total 98 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier when I counted 4's, I had 187 4's. So, the difference would be 187 (4's) minus 98 (8's) = 89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 8's. Let me recount:\n\nUnits place: 48 full decades, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial decade (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems right.\n\nTens place: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10\u00d74 +9=49. That's correct.\n\nHundreds place: 0, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49+49=98. Correct.\n\nNow, 4's: units (48), tens (50), hundreds (89). 48+50=98, +89=187.\n\nSo, 187-98=89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers. So, each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place of 4's, I had 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10 4's, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48 blocks of 10, so 48 4's. Correct.\n\nSo, 48+50+89=187.\n\n8's: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. 80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 full decades, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus, in the last partial decade (481-488), units digit 8 appears once. So, 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nThus, 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about page 488, the digits are 4,8,8. So, that's two 8's in the tens and units place, but in my count, I included that in the tens place as part of 480-488, which is correct.\n\nWait, let me just think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nAnother way is to consider each digit position separately and calculate how many times each digit appears.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\nIn any range, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) multiplied by 1, plus the remainder if the last partial decade includes d.\n\nSimilarly for the tens and hundreds places.\n\nSo, for units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) = 48. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so we add 1? Wait, no, wait. Actually, for units digit, the number of times a digit d appears is floor(n/10) + (1 if the last digit is >=d else 0), but only if d !=0.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is: for units digit, the count is (n // 10) * 1 + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0) when d !=0.\n\nWait, let's test this. For n=488, d=4:\n\nUnits digit count for 4: (488 // 10) = 48. Then, since 488 %10 =8 >=4, so add 1. So, 48+1=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, that's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, no, wait. When n=488, the last number is 488, so the units digits go up to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? From 4,14,24,...,484. Let's see, 484 is the last one before 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. But earlier, I thought it was 48. Wait, so where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier when I considered the units digit for 4's. I thought that in the last partial decade, 481-488, the units digit doesn't include 4, but actually, 484 is within 481-488, so 4 does appear once in the units place in the last partial decade. So, the correct count for units digit 4's is 48 (from the full decades) plus 1 (from the last partial decade) =49.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought it was 48. That was my mistake. So, I need to correct that.\n\nSo, units digit 4's: 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: same approach. (488//10)=48, and 488%10=8 >=8, so add 1. So, 48+1=49. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, units digit 4's:49, units digit 8's:49.\n\nNow, tens digit:\n\nFor the tens digit, the formula is a bit different. The number of times a digit d appears in the tens place is calculated by:\n\nhigher = n // 100\ncurrent = (n // 10) % 10\nlower = n % 10\n\nIf d < current: count = (higher +1) * 10\nIf d == current: count = higher *10 + lower +1\nIf d > current: count = higher *10\n\nBut I might be mixing up the formula. Alternatively, for each position, the count can be calculated based on higher digits and lower digits.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of blocks. For the tens digit:\n\nEach time the tens digit cycles through 0-9 every 100 numbers. So, for each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly for 8.\n\nSo, for 4's in the tens place:\n\nNumber of hundreds in 488: 4 (since 400 is the start of the 4th hundred). So, for each hundred, 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. So, 4 hundreds \u00d710=40. But wait, 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so the last block (400-488) only goes up to 488, so the tens digit 4 in 440-449 is within this range. So, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10. So, total 4 hundreds \u00d710=40, but wait, 400-488 is part of the 4th hundred, so perhaps it's better to think:\n\nFrom 0-488, the number of times the tens digit is 4 is:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds:4 (0-399). Each contributes 10 numbers where tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49 in each hundred). So, 4\u00d710=40.\n\nNow, in the incomplete hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds:4. Each contributes 10 numbers where tens digit is 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4\u00d710=40.\n\nIn the incomplete hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the end). So, total 40+9=49.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier count: 50 4's in the tens place, 49 8's.\n\nNow, hundreds digit:\n\nFor 4's: the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488. So, that's 89 numbers, as 488-400+1=89. So, 89 4's.\n\nFor 8's: hundreds digit is 8 from 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so there are 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, +89=188.\n\nWait, wait, earlier I thought units digit 4's were 49, but when I first calculated, I thought it was 48. So, now, with the correct count of 49 units 4's, total 4's are 49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98.\n\nSo, difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, now I'm getting a different answer because I corrected the units digit count for 4's from 48 to 49.\n\nWait, let me check again.\n\nUnits digit for 4's: from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nNumbers are 4,14,24,...,484. So, the last one is 484, which is within 488. So, how many numbers is that?\n\nIt's an arithmetic sequence starting at 4, ending at 484, with common difference 10.\n\nNumber of terms: ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8's: 8,18,28,...,488. So, last term is 488, which is within range.\n\nNumber of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1=(480/10)+1=48+1=49.\n\nSo, units digit 4's:49, units digit 8's:49.\n\nTens digit 4's:50, as calculated.\n\nTens digit 8's:49.\n\nHundreds digit 4's:89, hundreds digit 8's:0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 89, but now it's 90. Which is correct?\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\n- Units digit 4's:49\n- Tens digit 4's:50\n- Hundreds digit 4's:89\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nUnits digit 8's:49\nTens digit 8's:49\nHundreds digit 8's:0\nTotal 8's:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89, but that was because I had miscalculated the units digit 4's as 48 instead of 49.\n\nSo, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens digit counts.\n\nFor 4's in the tens place:\n\n- 40-49:10\n- 140-149:10\n- 240-249:10\n- 340-349:10\n- 440-449:10\nTotal:5\u00d710=50. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place:\n\n- 80-89:10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\nTotal:4\u00d710 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds digit:\n\n4's:400-488:89 numbers. Correct.\n\n8's:0. Correct.\n\nUnits digit:\n\n4's:49, 8's:49. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, total 8's:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's the right approach. I had initially made a mistake in counting the units digit 4's as 48 instead of 49, which led me to an incorrect difference of 89. After correcting that, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - There are 48 complete decades (1-480), contributing 48 instances.\n   - In the last partial decade (481-488), 484 has a 4 in the units place, adding 1.\n   - **Total:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit is 4 in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 instances.\n   - **Total:** 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total:** 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - There are 48 complete decades, contributing 48 instances.\n   - In the last partial decade (481-488), 488 has an 8 in the units place, adding 1.\n   - **Total:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit is 8 in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - There are 4 complete blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 instances.\n   - In the last partial block (480-488), the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers.\n   - **Total:** 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, which is beyond 488.\n   - **Total:** 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each place value one by one.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, the 4 is in page 4; from 11-20, it's in page 14, and so on. Now, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 pages (481-488). In each complete block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial block from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once in 484. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, let's count the number of 4's in the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, in each hundred, there are 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred from 401-488. Wait, but 401-488 is actually part of the 400-499 range, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, in each full hundred, there are 10 4's in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So that's another 10 pages where the tens digit is 4. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, hold on, I think I made a mistake here. Because 401-488 includes pages 401-488, which is 88 pages. The tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, yes, that's correct. So, 4 full hundreds give 40, and the partial gives 10, so 50 total 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 only for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nWait, but when I'm counting digits, each page number is three digits, so 400 is 4 0 0, so the hundreds digit is 4, which counts as one occurrence. Similarly, 401 is 4 0 1, so again, hundreds digit is 4. So, yes, from 400-488, that's 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me sum up the 4's from each place:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\n\nTotal number of 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll need to count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-10, it's 8; 11-20, it's 18; and so on. How many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488? As before, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 pages (481-488). Each complete block contributes one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. In the partial block, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 8 for 10 consecutive numbers in each hundred: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, in each hundred, there are 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. How many full hundreds are there in 488? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and a partial hundred from 401-488. In each full hundred, we have 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, we have pages 480-488. So, how many pages is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 pages. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages (480-488). So, that's 9 occurrences. Therefore, total 8's in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 starting at 480. So, 480-488 is 9 pages, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, yes, 9 more. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only for pages from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, there are 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units: 49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98. So, 98 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier, for the 4's, I had 188. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 8's. Let me go through each place again.\n\nUnits place: Each 10 numbers, 8 appears once. 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 times in complete blocks, plus in the last partial block (481-488), 8 appears once (488). So, 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 8's in the tens place (e.g., 80-89). There are 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 8's. So, 40+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 800-899, but book ends at 488, so 0. Correct.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nNow, 4's:188, 8's:98. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I didn't make a mistake in the 4's count. Let me go through each place again.\n\nUnits place for 4's: Each 10 numbers, 4 appears once. 488/10=48.8, so 48 times, plus in the last partial block, 484 is the only 4 in units place. So, 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: Each hundred has 10 4's in the tens place (40-49). 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 40+10=50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: From 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 4's. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that in the last partial hundred for the 8's, I might have miscounted? From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as for each place, how many times 8 appears.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\nNumber of 8's in units place = floor(488/10) + (if the last digit is >=8, add 1). So, floor(488/10)=48, and since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is equal to 8, so add 1. So, 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens digit:\n\nNumber of 8's in tens place = floor(488/100)*10 + (if the last two digits >=80, add (last two digits -80 +1)). So, floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. The last two digits are 88, which is >=80, so 88-80+1=9. So, total 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: floor(488/1000)=0, since 488<1000, so 0.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's:\n\nUnits digit:\n\nfloor(488/10)=48, and 488 mod 10=8, which is >=4, so 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the formula for units digit would be:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place = floor(488/10) + (if the last digit >=4, add 1). But actually, it's more precise to say that in each block of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place, so the total is floor((488 +1)/10). Wait, maybe I should use a different approach.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think that for the units digit, the number of 4's is equal to the number of complete decades plus 1 if the last digit is >=4. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus if the last digit (8) is >=4, add 1. So, 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's in tens place = floor(488/100)*10 + (if the last two digits >=40, add (min(40, last two digits +1 -40))). Wait, perhaps it's better to think that for each hundred, there are 10 4's in the tens place. So, floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. Then, the last partial hundred is 401-488. The tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40+10=50.\n\nHundreds digit:\n\nNumber of 4's in hundreds place = floor(488/1000)=0, but since 400-488 is within the hundreds place, it's 488-400+1=89.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 pages, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits digit:49, tens digit:49, hundreds digit:0, total 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the 8's tens place count. Let me check again. The tens digit is 8 from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except the last one, which contributes only 9 because the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40, plus 9 from the last partial hundred, total 49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 188 4's and 98 8's. So, 90 more 4's. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another method to verify. For example, for each digit place, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nBut I think the method I used is correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4. There are 48 complete blocks (480 pages) and one partial block (481-488). The 4 appears once in each complete block and once in the partial block (484). Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 4's (e.g., 40-49). There are 4 complete blocks (400 pages) contributing 40 4's. The partial block (401-488) contributes 10 4's (440-449). Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 each have a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 4's.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Count the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 8. There are 48 complete blocks and one partial block (481-488), where 488 contributes one 8. Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 8's (e.g., 80-89). There are 4 complete blocks contributing 40 8's. The partial block (401-488) contributes 9 8's (480-488). Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have an 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe digit 4 is printed 90 more times than the digit 8.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can use a systematic approach for each digit place.\n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. For the units digit to be 4, the page numbers would be 4, 14, 24, 34, ..., up to 484. I need to find how many such numbers there are. The first number is 4, and the last number in the units place with 4 before 488 would be 484. To find the count, I can subtract 4 from 484 and then divide by 10, then add 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 484 is the 49th number where the units digit is 4. But wait, does 484 fall within 488? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, that gives 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99, there's one block (40-49). From 100-199, another block (140-149). Similarly, 200-299 has 240-249, 300-399 has 340-349, and 400-488 has 440-449. So, that's 5 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks would give 5*10=50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Wait, but in the last block, 440-449, does 449 exceed 488? No, 449 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers are valid. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through each digit place again.\n\nStarting with the units place. The units digit is 8 in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last number with 8 in the units place is 488. Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. The first number is 8, the last is 488. So, using the same method: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me check if 480-489 is within the book's pages. Since the book ends at 488, 480-488 are valid. So, from 0-99, 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199, 180-189 is another 10. From 200-299, 280-289 is another 10. From 300-399, 380-389 is another 10. From 400-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 489 would be beyond 488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nAdding up units, tens, and hundreds: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 numbers.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 numbers.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 numbers.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks have 10 each, and the last has 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers here.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I can use a systematic approach for each digit place. Let's start with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, in 1-10, the digit 4 appears once (at page 4), and the digit 8 appears once (at page 8). This pattern repeats every 10 numbers. So, for the units place, I can calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488 pages and then multiply by 1 (since each group contributes one 4 and one 8). But wait, I should also check if there's a partial group at the end. Let me compute that. The total number of pages is 488, so the number of complete groups of 10 is 488 divided by 10, which is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 complete groups and 8 extra pages. In each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so 48 times. Additionally, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, does the digit 4 appear in the units place here? Yes, at page 484. So that's one more 4. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, for the digit 8 in the units place: each group of 10 contributes one 8 (at page 8, 18, etc.), so 48 times. In the extra 8 pages, the units digit goes up to 8, so page 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more 8. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, so both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place. Hmm, that's interesting. So, in the units place, they're equal. Now, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, the digit 4 appears in a block of 10 pages every 100 pages. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 pages. Similarly, for 8, it's from 80-89. So, let's calculate how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each hundred block (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has one block of 10 where the tens digit is 4. So, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Now, we have the remaining pages from 401-488. The tens digit here can be 0-8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears from 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, does the tens digit 4 appear in 401-488? Yes, from 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, that's another 10 occurrences. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. Now, for the digit 8 in the tens place. Similarly, each hundred block has a block where the tens digit is 8, from 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, in each complete hundred, that's 10 occurrences. There are 4 complete hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the remaining pages 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 pages (480-488). So, that's 9 occurrences. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. So, so far, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. So, 4's are leading by 1 here. Now, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, how about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0. So, now, let's sum up all the occurrences. For 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the difference is 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each group of 10 pages contributes one 4. There are 48 complete groups (488 \u00f7 10 = 48 with a remainder of 8). Additionally, page 484 has a 4 in the units place. Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, each group contributes one 8. The last group includes page 488. Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences (e.g., 40-49). Four complete hundreds give 40.

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place one by one.\n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. For every set of ten numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, the 4 is in 4; in 11-20, it's in 14, and so on. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each of the 48 complete sets, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. Does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, 484 has a 4, so that's one more. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. Similarly, in each set of 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each group of ten. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in the numbers 40-49, which is ten times. So, each hundred has ten 4's in the tens place. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Then, 401-488 is the remaining 88 pages. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for ten numbers each, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's another ten numbers, so that's another 10. Wait, but 401-488 includes 440-449, so yes, that's ten more. So total 4's in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 more 4's.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units place is 49, tens place is 50, hundreds place is 89. So total 4's would be 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. As before, each set of ten has exactly one 8 in the units place. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488? 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last partial set is 481-488, which includes 488. So, in the units place, 488 has an 8, so that's one more. So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. Each hundred has a set where the tens digit is 8, which is ten numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many hundreds are there? Four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes ten 8's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489. But since our book only goes up to 488, that's 480-488, which is nine numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's nine 8's in the tens place. Therefore, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units place is 49, tens place is 49, hundreds place is 0. So, total 8's would be 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so 49 + 49 = 98. That seems right.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each step again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: Each 10 numbers contribute one 4. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the last 8 numbers (481-488) include 484, which is one more. So, 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. 4 hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: Each 10 numbers contribute one 8. 48 full sets, so 48, plus the last set (481-488) includes 488, which is another 8. So, 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place. 4 hundreds, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: None, since the book doesn't go beyond 488. So, 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for 8's. In 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, 488 is included, so that's one more 8.\n\nI think I did this correctly. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each set of 10 numbers contributes one 4. There are 48 complete sets (480 numbers) and 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n   - 48 sets \u00d7 1 = 48, plus one more from 484, totaling 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Four full hundreds (1-400) contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - In 401-488, 440-449 adds 10 more.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - From 400-488, there are 89 numbers, each contributing a 4.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each set of 10 numbers contributes one 8. 48 complete sets contribute 48, plus one from 488.\n   - Total: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 8's. Four full hundreds contribute 40.\n   - In 401-488, 480-488 contributes 9 more.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think in terms of each digit place separately. Let me see. For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), I can calculate how many times 4 appears. Similarly for 8. So, let's start with the units place. For the units digit, in every block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once at page 4. From 11-20, it's at page 14, and so on. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each complete block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 blocks \u00d7 1 = 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear in the units place here? Yes, at 484. So that's one more. So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Now, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4, so that's 10 times. How many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete blocks and 88 extra numbers. So, in each complete block, 10 times 4 appears in the tens place, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (from 400 to 488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? It appears once every 100 numbers, so in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449. That's 10 times. Wait, but 488 is less than 450? No, wait, 488 is higher than 449, so pages 440-449 are within 400-488. So, that's another 10 times. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 (from the complete blocks) + 10 = 50. Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for each number from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing 1, so 48, plus 1 in the last 8, total 49. Tens place: 4 complete blocks of 100, each contributing 10, so 40, plus 10 in the last 88, total 50. Hundreds place: from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. So 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcounting somewhere. Let me think: from 1-99, how many 4's are there? Units place: 9 times (4,14,...,84). Tens place: 10 times (40-49). So total 19. From 100-399: hundreds digit is 1,2,3, so no 4's there. But wait, 100-399: the hundreds digit is 1,2,3, so no 4's there. So, from 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so 89 times. Units place: in 400-488, how many 4's in units place? Let's see: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times. Wait, but earlier I thought units place from 400-488 would have 9 instances, but earlier I had 49 total units 4's. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recast this approach. Maybe it's better to count each digit place separately, but perhaps I'm confusing the ranges. Let me try a different approach. For units digit: in every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the remaining 8 numbers (481-488). In those 8, does 4 appear in the units place? Yes, at 484. So units digit 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. For tens digit: in every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, in each 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (40-49). From 1-488, how many complete hundreds? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles again. How many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8. So, 40-49 in the tens place would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 more. So total tens digit 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. For hundreds digit: from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, hundreds digit 4's: 89. So total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process. Units digit: in every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, units digit 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Tens digit: in every 100 numbers, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (80-89). From 1-488, how many complete hundreds? 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, no: from 401-488, the tens digit cycles 0-8. So, when the tens digit is 8, it's 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the last partial hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. So total tens digit 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. Hundreds digit: the hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds digit 8's: 0. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Counting 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. Counting 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Let me check again. For tens digit 4's: from 1-400, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's 40-49 in each hundred, so 4 times 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct. For 8's: in the tens place, from 1-400, it's 40 times (80-89 in each hundred). From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In every 10 numbers, 4 appears once.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 complete sets, contributing 48 times.\n   - Remaining 8 numbers (481-488): 4 appears once (484).\n   - Total units digit 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In every 100 numbers, 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (40-49).\n   - 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.88 \u2192 4 complete sets, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times.\n   - Remaining 88 numbers (400-488): 4 appears in 440-449, contributing 10 times.\n   - Total tens digit 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n   - Total hundreds digit 4's: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In every 10 numbers, 8 appears once.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 complete sets, contributing 48 times.\n   - Remaining 8 numbers (481-488): 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total units digit 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In every 100 numbers, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (80-89).\n   - 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.88 \u2192 4 complete sets, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times.\n   - Remaining 88 numbers (400-488): 8 appears in 480-488, contributing 9 times.\n   - Total tens digit 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total hundreds digit 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should also do the same for 8's and then compare. Let me first count the number of 4's. Starting with single-digit page numbers: only page 4 has a 4. So that's 1 occurrence. Now, for two-digit numbers: from 10 to 99. I can think of each two-digit number as having a tens place and a units place. Let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. That would be from 40 to 49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Then, in the units place, 4 can appear in numbers like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, but wait, 44 has two 4's, so does that mean I should count each occurrence? Wait, no, I'm just counting the number of times 4 appears in the units place, so each of these numbers contributes one 4 in the units place. So that's 9 occurrences. Wait, but from 10 to 99, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 9 times (since 4 is in the units place once every 10 numbers, starting at 14, 24, ..., 94). So that's 9 occurrences. So for two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. Now, moving on to three-digit numbers: from 100 to 488. Let's break this down by hundreds, tens, and units places. First, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's see how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That would be from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9, and I want to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), I can calculate the number of times 4 appears in the tens place. Let's do this for each hundred:\n\n- 100-199: The tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in 100-199, the tens digit is 4 for 140-149, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 occurrences.\n- 200-299: Similarly, 240-249, another 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n- 300-399: 340-349, another 10 occurrences.\n- 400-488: Now, here, the hundreds digit is 4, and we're looking at the tens digit. The tens digit goes from 0-8 because the last page is 488. So, when the tens digit is 4, we have 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is from 400 to 488, so the tens digit can go up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, when the tens digit is 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in total, for the tens place across all three-digit numbers, that's 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 occurrences.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. Similarly, for each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, the units digit is 4 once every 10 numbers. Let's calculate this for each hundred:\n\n- 100-199: The units digit is 4 in 104, 114, 124, 134, 144, 154, 164, 174, 184, 194. That's 10 occurrences.\n- 200-299: Similarly, 204, 214, ..., 294. Another 10 occurrences.\n- 300-399: 304, 314, ..., 394. Another 10 occurrences.\n- 400-488: Now, here, the units digit is 4 in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488. So, let's count: starting from 404, each 10 numbers, up to 484. How many is that? Let's see: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the ninth occurrence (since 404 is the first, 414 second, etc., up to 484 being the ninth). Wait, 404 is 1, 414 is 2, ..., 484 is 9. So that's 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, adding them up: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 occurrences in the units place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's in three-digit numbers is hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89 + 40 = 129, 129 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, no, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, the hundreds place in three-digit numbers: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89.\n\nThen, the tens place: for each hundred, 10 times, so 4 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40.\n\nUnits place: for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each have 10 occurrences, and 400-488 has 9, so 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's add the single-digit and two-digit numbers. Single-digit: 1 occurrence. Two-digit: 19 occurrences. So total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188. Hmm, maybe that's correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: single-digit, two-digit, three-digit.\n\nSingle-digit: only page 8, so 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: from 10 to 99. Let's count 8's in tens and units places.\n\nTens place: 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: numbers ending with 8: 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Wait, but 88 has two 8's, but I'm just counting the units place, so it's one occurrence per number. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 occurrences.\n\nNow, three-digit numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place in three-digit numbers from 100-488.\n\nFor each hundred:\n\n- 100-199: The tens digit is 8 for 180-189, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n- 200-299: Similarly, 280-289, another 10 occurrences.\n- 300-399: 380-389, another 10 occurrences.\n- 400-488: Here, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. Wait, how many numbers is that? 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: Now, how many times does 8 appear in the units place in three-digit numbers?\n\nFor each hundred:\n\n- 100-199: Units digit is 8 in 108, 118, 128, 138, 148, 158, 168, 178, 188, 198. That's 10 occurrences.\n- 200-299: 208, 218, ..., 298. Another 10 occurrences.\n- 300-399: 308, 318, ..., 398. Another 10 occurrences.\n- 400-488: Units digit is 8 in 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included, so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total in units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 occurrences.\n\nSo, total number of 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place (39) + units place (39) = 78.\n\nAdding single-digit and two-digit numbers: single-digit 1 + two-digit 19 + three-digit 78 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, total 8's: 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 4).\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place: 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n- Units place: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94: 9 numbers, so 9 4's.\nTotal two-digit: 19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n- Tens place: In each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), 10 each except 400-488 where it's 10 as well because 440-449 is within 400-488. So, 4*10=40.\n- Units place: In each hundred except 400-488, 10 each, and in 400-488, 9. So, 3*10 +9=39.\nTotal three-digit: 89+40+39=168.\n\nTotal 4's: 1+19+168=188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 8).\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n- Units place: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98: 9 numbers, so 9 8's.\nTotal two-digit: 19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Tens place: 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). Total: 39.\n- Units place: 108,118,...,198 (10), 208,...,298 (10), 308,...,398 (10), 408,...,488 (9). Total:39.\nTotal three-digit: 39+39=78.\n\nTotal 8's: 1+19+78=98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought, in the three-digit units place for 4's, I had 39, but let me check 400-488: units digit 4 occurs in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in 400-488, units digit 8 occurs in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, correct.\n\nSo, the counts seem accurate. Therefore, the number of 4's is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit page numbers.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - Only page 4 contains a 4.\n   - Total: 1 occurrence.\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** Pages 40-49 (10 numbers).\n   - **Units place:** Pages 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94 (9 numbers).\n   - Total: 10 + 9 = 19 occurrences.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 (89 numbers).\n   - **Tens place:** Each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 40.\n   - **Units place:** Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences except 400-488, which contributes 9, totaling 39.\n   - Total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 occurrences.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - Only page 8 contains an 8.\n   - Total: 1 occurrence.\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** Pages 80-89 (10 numbers).\n   - **Units place:** Pages 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98 (9 numbers).\n   - Total: 10 + 9 = 19 occurrences.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Tens place:** Each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) contributes 10, 10, 10, and 9 respectively, totaling 39.\n   - **Units place:** Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences except 400-488, which contributes 9, totaling 39.\n   - Total: 39 + 39 = 78 occurrences.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I can handle each digit place one by one.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, etc. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 pages. So, in each of these 48 blocks, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the extra 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so there's another 4 in 484. So, that's one more. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49. \n\nNext, let's count the number of 4's in the tens place. In the tens place, a 4 appears in a block of 100 pages. For example, from 40 to 49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, in each block of 100, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many full blocks of 100 are there in 488? There are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then the last block is 401-488. Wait, but 401-488 is only 88 pages, so the tens digit in that last block would go from 0 to 8 in the tens place. So, in each of the first four blocks, there are 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last block (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 4, that's the numbers 440-449. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 401-488? Yes, because 440 is greater than 401 and 449 is less than 488. So, that's another 10 4's in the tens place. So, total 4's in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50. \n\nWait, but hold on. The last block is 401-488, which is 88 pages. So, from 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, when the tens digit is 4, that's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, that's correct, 10 more 4's in the tens place. So, 40 + 10 = 50. \n\nNow, let's check if there's any 4 in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the page numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4. So, how many 4's is that? It's 89 times, because each page number from 400 to 488 contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. Wait, but I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? It's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. So, adding that up, the total number of 4's would be units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 = 99, and 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll count the number of 8's in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in every block of 10, there's one 8 in the units place: 8, 18, 28, etc. So, how many full blocks of 10 are there in 488? As before, 48 full blocks (since 488 / 10 = 48.8). So, 48 blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so that's 48. Now, the extra 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8, so there's another 8 in 488. So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. In the tens place, 8 appears in a block of 100 pages. For example, from 80 to 89, the tens digit is 8 for all 10 numbers. So, in each block of 100, there are 10 8's in the tens place. Now, how many full blocks of 100 are there in 488? Four full blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the last block is 401-488, which is 88 pages. The tens digit in this block goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, when the tens digit is 8, that's 480-488. But how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 more 8's. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so 98 total. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. I said that from 400 to 488, each page number has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Then, in the tens place, I had 50, and units place 49. So, 89 + 50 + 49 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 49, tens place: 49, so 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. In the last block, 401-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, which is in 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, in the last block, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. So, 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nI think that's all. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** In every block of 10 pages, there's one 4. With 48 full blocks (480 pages) and an extra 8 pages (481-488), there are 48 + 1 = 49 fours.\n   - **Tens place:** In every block of 100 pages, there are 10 fours. With 4 full blocks (400 pages) and the last block (401-488) contributing another 10 fours, there are 40 + 10 = 50 fours.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, each page has a 4 in the hundreds place, totaling 89 fours.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to 4's, there are 48 full blocks and an extra 8 pages, totaling 49 eights.\n   - **Tens place:** In every block of 100 pages, there are 10 eights. The last block contributes 9 eights (480-488), totaling 40 + 9 = 49 eights.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No eights since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place one by one. \n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. For the units digit, the 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, that's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial group, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 484 fall into this range? Yes, so the units digit 4 appears once more here. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 40-49. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, 4 full hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears again in the 440-449 range. That's another 10 times. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place again. Every 10 numbers, the units digit 8 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10? 48 complete groups, as before, with 8 extra numbers. Each group contributes 1 eight, so 48 times. In the last partial group, 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. So, the units digit 8 appears once more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. Similar to the 4's, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers every 100. So, in each full hundred, that's 10 eights. There are 4 full hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in the 480-489 range, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, so in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, we have 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (480-488). Wait, no, 480 is included, so 480, 481, ..., 488: that's 9 numbers. But wait, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers, but in this case, only 9 are present. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor the 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus, in 481-488, 484 has a 4 in units, so +1. Total 49.\n\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Plus, in 400-488, the 440-449 range, which is 10 numbers, so +10. Total 50.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 full groups, 48, plus 488, so +1. Total 49.\n\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds, 40. In 400-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so +9. Total 49.\n\n- Hundreds: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10 (480 numbers), contributing 48 fours.\n   - In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 484 contributes one more 4.\n   - Total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49).\n   - There are 4 complete hundreds (400 numbers), contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 fours.\n   - In the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, contributing 10 more fours.\n   - Total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10, contributing 48 eights.\n   - In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 488 contributes one more 8.\n   - Total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - There are 4 complete hundreds, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights.\n   - In the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n   - Total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, which is beyond the book's page count.\n   - Total hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should first consider one-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears once (page 4), and the digit 8 appears once (page 8). So, in one-digit numbers, 4 appears once, 8 appears once. Now, moving on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I think I can count the number of times 4 appears in the tens place and the number of times it appears in the units place separately. Similarly for 8. Let me start with the 4's. In the tens place, the numbers would be 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. In the units place, 4 can appear in numbers like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, from 10 to 99, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let me count: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 times. So total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. Now for 8's in two-digit numbers. In the tens place, 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. In the units place, 8 appears in 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 times. So total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 + 9 = 19 times. Wait, so in two-digit numbers, both 4's and 8's appear 19 times each. Interesting. Now, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is where it gets a bit more complicated because the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, and the tens and units digits can vary. I think I should break this down by each digit place: hundreds, tens, and units. Let me start with the hundreds place. For 4's: The hundreds digit is 4 only for page numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. For 8's: The hundreds digit is 8, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. Now, moving on to the tens place in three-digit numbers. For 4's: The tens digit is 4. So, in the range 100-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Let's see: 100-199: tens digit is 4 for 140-149, which is 10 numbers. 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers as well. So, that's 4 sets of 10, totaling 40 times. Wait, but wait, 400-488: 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, 10 numbers. So, total 40 times 4 appears in the tens place. For 8's: Similarly, the tens digit is 8. So, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. Let me check: 180-189: 10 numbers, 280-289: 10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total 10+10+10+9=39 times. So, 8 appears 39 times in the tens place. Now, the units place for three-digit numbers. For 4's: The units digit is 4. So, in each hundred, the units digit cycles every 10. So, from 100-199: 104,114,124,...,194: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 200-299: 204,214,...,294: 10. 300-399: 304,...,394:10. 400-488: 404,414,...,484: how many? Let's see, from 404 to 484, stepping by 10: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. So, 10+10+10+9=39 times. So, 4 appears 39 times in the units place. For 8's: Similarly, units digit is 8. So, 108,118,...,198:10. 208,...,298:10. 308,...,398:10. 408,...,488: let's see, from 408 to 488, stepping by 10: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers. So, total 10+10+10+9=39 times. So, 8 appears 39 times in the units place. Now, let me summarize the three-digit numbers: 4's in hundreds place:89, tens:40, units:39. Total 4's:89+40+39=168. 8's in hundreds place:0, tens:39, units:39. Total 8's:0+39+39=78. Wait, but wait, let me double-check the tens and units for three-digit numbers. For 4's in tens place: I thought 10 each in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. But wait, 400-488: the tens digit is 4 only from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, correct. So, 4 sets of 10, so 40. Similarly, units place for 4's: in each hundred, 10 numbers, except the last one where it's 9. So, 10+10+10+9=39. So, 40+39=79 in tens and units, plus 89 in hundreds, total 168. For 8's: tens place is 39, units place is 39, so 78. Now, let me add up all the 4's and 8's across all page numbers. Starting with 4's: one-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:168. Total 4's:1+19+168=188. 8's: one-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:78. Total 8's:1+19+78=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For three-digit 4's: hundreds place 89, tens 40, units 39. 89+40=129, 129+39=168. Correct. 8's: tens 39, units 39, total 78. Correct. Then, adding one-digit and two-digit: 4's:1+19=20, 20+168=188. 8's:1+19=20, 20+78=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **One-Digit Page Numbers (1-9):**\n   - **4's:** Appears once (page 4).\n   - **8's:** Appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-Digit Page Numbers (10-99):**\n   - **4's:**\n     - Tens place: 40-49 (10 times).\n     - Units place: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94 (9 times).\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **8's:**\n     - Tens place: 80-89 (10 times).\n     - Units place: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98 (9 times).\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\n3. **Three-Digit Page Numbers (100-488):**\n   - **4's:**\n     - Hundreds place: 400-488 (89 times).\n     - Tens place: 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 (4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40 times).\n     - Units place: 104,114,...,194, 204,...,294, 304,...,394, 404,...,484 (3 sets \u00d7 10 + 9 = 39 times).\n     - Total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n   - **8's:**\n     - Hundreds place: 0 times (no 800s pages).\n     - Tens place: 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 (3 sets \u00d7 10 + 9 = 39 times).\n     - Units place: 108,118,...,198, 208,...,298, 308,...,398, 408,...,488 (3 sets \u00d7 10 + 9 = 39 times).\n     - Total: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **4's:** 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n   - **8's:** 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place one by one. For the units place, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once. For example, in 1-10, it's on page 4; 11-20, it's on page 14, and so on. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). Each complete block contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial block (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (page 484). So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49. Next, the tens place. In every block of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers. For example, in 1-100, it's pages 40-49. So, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? That's 4 (since 400 is the last multiple of 100 before 488). Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the partial block from 400 to 488, the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449. That's 10 pages, so 10 more 4's. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50. Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 4's. Adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. Starting with the units place. Again, in every block of 10, 8 appears once. So, 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. The partial block (481-488) has units digits from 1-8, so 8 appears once (page 488). So, total 8's in units place are 48 + 1 = 49. Next, the tens place. In every block of 100, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many complete blocks of 100 are there? 4, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the partial block 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, but actually, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 pages: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in tens place are 40 + 9 = 49. Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units: 48 complete blocks (1-480) each with one 4, so 48. Then, 481-488: 484 has a 4 in units, so +1, total 49. Tens: 4 complete blocks (1-400), each contributing 10 4's, so 4*10=40. Then, 400-488: 440-449 has 10 4's in tens place, so +10, total 50. Hundreds: 400-488: 89 pages, so 89 4's. Total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For 8's: units: 48 complete blocks, 48, plus 488, so +1, total 49. Tens: 4 complete blocks, 40, plus in 400-488, 480-488 is 9 pages, so +9, total 49. Hundreds: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In every block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks (1-480), contributing 48 fours.\n   - In the partial block (481-488), 4 appears once (page 484).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In every block of 100 numbers, 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers.\n   - There are 4 complete blocks (1-400), contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 fours.\n   - In the partial block (400-488), 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (440-449).\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - From page 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In every block of 10 numbers, 8 appears once.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks (1-480), contributing 48 eights.\n   - In the partial block (481-488), 8 appears once (page 488).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In every block of 100 numbers, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers.\n   - There are 4 complete blocks (1-400), contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights.\n   - In the partial block (400-488), 8 appears in the tens place for 9 numbers (480-488).\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - There are no pages numbered 800 or above, so no 8's here.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately because the count might vary depending on whether it's the units, tens, or hundreds place. \n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in the units place. For every group of ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many such groups are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each of those 48 groups, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers, 481-488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 would have a 4 in the units place. So that's one more. So total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the number of 4's in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 40-49, that's one block. Then 140-149 is another, 240-249 another, 340-349 another, and 440-449 another. So that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 50 4's.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process, checking each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, every group of ten numbers has one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, that's 48 full groups of ten and 8 extra numbers. So, 48 8's in the units place from the full groups, and then in the extra numbers (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So that's one more. So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page. So, let's see: each block from 80-89, 180-189, etc., has 10 numbers, contributing 10 8's each. How many such blocks are there? 80-89 is one, 180-189 is another, 280-289 another, 380-389 another, and then 480-488. So that's five blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks contribute 10 8's each, so 4 * 10 = 40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 8's. So total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 to 899, but wait, the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. For the tens place, I had 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 more 8's in the tens place, making it 40 + 9 = 49. That seems right. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place. When I'm considering 480-488, the tens digit is 8, right? So, 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So yes, 9 8's there. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's there. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's in the tens place, I had 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 50. Units place: 49. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's, units place: 49, tens place: 49, so 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's. That seems right.\n\nAnother way to think about the 4's in the hundreds place is that from 400 to 499, there are 100 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. But since the book only goes up to 488, we have 89 numbers. So, 89 4's.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding how many more 4's are printed than 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Every group of ten numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) has one '4' in the units place.\n     - There are 48 full groups of ten (1-480), contributing 48 '4's.\n     - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include one '4' (484).\n     - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - '4' appears in the tens place for numbers 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n     - Each block contributes 10 '4's, and there are 5 such blocks.\n     - Total in tens place: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - Numbers 400-488 each have '4' in the hundreds place.\n     - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n     - Total in hundreds place: 89.\n\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Similar to '4's, each group of ten has one '8' in the units place.\n     - 48 full groups contribute 48 '8's.\n     - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include one '8' (488).\n     - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - '8' appears in the tens place for numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n     - The first four blocks contribute 10 '8's each: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n     - The last block (480-488) contributes 9 '8's.\n     - Total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - No page numbers have '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n     - Total in hundreds place: 0.\n\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'. \n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place one by one. \n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in the units place. For every set of ten numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Each ten has one 4, so the number of 4's in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a digit, I think it's 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and then in the last partial set (481-488), there's a 484, which is another 4. So that's 49 4's in the units place. Wait, let me check that again. From 1 to 480, that's 48 sets of ten, each contributing one 4, so 48 4's. Then from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So that's 48 + 1 = 49 4's in the units place.\n\nNext, let's count the number of 4's in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 for numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these sets has ten numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such sets are there? Let's see: 40-49 is one set, then each hundred has another set. So from 1 to 488, the hundreds go up to 4. So, how many sets of ten where the tens digit is 4? For each hundred, there's one set, so from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is only up to 488, so the set 440-449 is complete, but 450-488 doesn't have a full set. But wait, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is a full set of ten. So, how many sets? Let me count: 40-49 is one set, 140-149 is another, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five sets. Each set contributes ten 4's in the tens place. So 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Hmm, that seems high. Wait, no, actually, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll count how many 8's are in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in each set of ten numbers, there's exactly one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many 8's in the units place? Each ten contributes one 8, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, and then in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So that's 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 8 for numbers from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the hundreds place, but let's see how many 8's in the tens place. Each of these sets (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has ten numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, how many such sets are there? From 0-99: 80-89, that's one set. Then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only nine numbers (480-488), so the tens digit is 8 only for 480-488, but the tens digit is 8 for all these, right? Because 480 has tens digit 8, 481 has 8, etc., up to 488. So that's nine numbers where the tens digit is 8. But wait, in the earlier sets, each set has ten numbers. So, how many sets of ten where the tens digit is 8? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, that's four full sets of ten and one partial set of nine. Each full set contributes ten 8's in the tens place, so 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40. The partial set (480-488) has nine 8's in the tens place. So total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. From 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's. Similarly, 180-189: another 10, so 20. 280-289: 30. 380-389: 40. Then 480-488: nine numbers, so nine 8's. So 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so 98 8's in total.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's are 188, total 8's are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49. Let me think: from 1 to 488, every ten numbers contribute one 4 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and then in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included, which is the 49th 4. So that's correct.\n\n- Tens place: 50. Each set of ten where the tens digit is 4 contributes ten 4's. How many such sets? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five sets, each with ten 4's, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 89. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So 89 4's. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49. Same logic as 4's. Each ten contributes one 8, and in the last partial ten, 488 is included, so 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 49. Let's recount: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So 4\u00d710 +9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0. Since the book ends at 488, there are no 800-899 pages. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49=98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the hundreds place, I might have made a mistake. Let me check the hundreds place again for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89 4's. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, the hundreds place is zero, so no problem there.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every ten numbers contribute one 4.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of ten, each contributing one 4, and one additional 4 in 484.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each range has ten numbers, contributing ten 4's per range.\n   - Total ranges: 5, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, inclusive.\n   - This is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, every ten numbers contribute one 8.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets, plus one in 488.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - The tens digit is 8 in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges each contribute ten 8's, and 480-488 contributes nine.\n   - Total: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have an 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each place value separately because the count might vary depending on whether we're looking at the ones place, tens place, or hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4). From 11-20, 4 appears once (page 14), and so on. So, how many such groups are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10 and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). So, in each of these 48 groups, there's one 4 in the units place, giving 48 fours. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (page 484). So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for the tens digit, each group of 100 pages will have 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for pages 40-49, which is 10 times. Then, from 101-200, again 10 times (140-149), and so on. Let me figure out how many hundreds there are. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). So, in each full hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages. So, 4 hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449, which is 10 pages. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So, that's another 10 fours. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only for pages 400-488. So, how many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (including both 400 and 488). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, meaning 89 fours. So, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\nStarting with units place: Similar to 4's, in each group of 10, the digit 8 appears once. So, how many full groups of 10 are there up to 488? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (page 488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For the tens digit, each group of 100 pages has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, from 1-100, the tens digit is 8 for pages 80-89 (10 pages). Similarly, from 101-200, 180-189, another 10, and so on. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40 eights. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 8 in the range 480-489, but wait, our range only goes up to 488. So, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages (480-488). So, that's 9 eights. Therefore, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. Therefore, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. For the tens place in the last partial hundred (401-488), I considered 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 9 eights in the tens place. So, 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait a minute, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place: Each 10 pages contribute 1 four. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1 four, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once. Total: 49.\n\nTens place: Each 100 pages contribute 10 fours in the tens place. 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 fours, so 40. Then, the remaining 88 pages (401-488) have the tens digit as 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 10 fours. Total: 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 fours. So, total 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\nUnits place: Each 10 pages contribute 1 eight. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, 48 eights. Remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digit 8 on page 488. So, 1 more, total 49.\n\nTens place: Each 100 pages contribute 10 eights in the tens place. 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 eights, so 40. The remaining 88 pages (401-488) have the tens digit 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 9 eights. Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: As before, no hundreds digit is 8, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90 more fours.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place in the 401-488 range for 8's. So, from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 8 when the tens digit is 8, which would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 eights in the tens place. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 fours. That's correct.\n\nAnother way to check: Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is equal to (N // 10) + (1 if the units digit of N is >= d else 0). Wait, but actually, it's floor(N / 10) + 1 if the units digit is >= d, but since we're counting how many times d appears in the units place, it's floor(N / 10) + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think.\n\nActually, for each digit d (0-9), the number of times it appears in the units place up to N is equal to floor(N / 10) + (1 if (N % 10) >= d and d != 0 else 0). Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to think as follows:\n\nFor units digit d, the number of times it appears is equal to the number of complete groups of 10, which is floor(N / 10), plus 1 if the remaining digits (N % 10) are >= d and d != 0. Wait, but when d is 0, it's a bit different because 0 doesn't appear in the units place for numbers like 10, 20, etc. But in our case, we're considering d=4 and d=8, which are non-zero, so the formula would be:\n\nNumber of times d appears in units place = floor(N / 10) + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0).\n\nSo, for N=488, d=4:\n\nfloor(488 / 10) = 48. Then, 488 % 10 = 8, which is >=4, so add 1. So, 48 + 1 = 49 fours in units place.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8:\n\nfloor(488 / 10) = 48. 488 % 10 = 8, which is equal to 8, so add 1. So, 48 + 1 = 49 eights in units place.\n\nOkay, that matches what I had before.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the tens place up to N can be calculated by considering each hundred. The formula is a bit more involved. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit d appears 10 times in the tens place. The number of full hundreds is floor(N / 100). Then, for the remaining part, we need to see how many times d appears in the tens place.\n\nThe remaining part is N % 100. If the remaining part is >= 10*(d+1), then we add 10. If it's >= 10*d, we add (remaining - 10*d + 1). Otherwise, we add 0.\n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose N is 488. So, N // 100 = 4 (since 4*100=400). Then, the remaining is 88.\n\nFor d=4 in tens place:\n\nIn each full hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, 4 full hundreds contribute 4*10=40 fours.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 pages (401-488). The tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 fours. So, total 40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8 in tens place:\n\nEach full hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nThe remaining 88 pages: the tens digit is 8 in 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 eights.\n\nSo, total 40 +9=49.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place:\n\nFor d=4, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nFor d=8, the hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, but since N=488, there are no such pages. So, 0 eights.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\n8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 pages. There are 48 full groups of 10, contributing 48 fours. The remaining 8 pages (481-488) include one more 4 (page 484). Total: 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times every 100 pages. Four full hundreds contribute 40 fours. The remaining 88 pages (401-488) include another 10 fours (440-449). Total: 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 pages. Total: 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 pages. There are 48 full groups, contributing 48 eights. The remaining 8 pages include one more 8 (page 488). Total: 49.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears 10 times every 100 pages. Four full hundreds contribute 40 eights. The remaining 88 pages include 9 eights (480-488). Total: 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place. Total: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place one by one.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in the units place. For the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.). So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 times 1, which is 48. But wait, we have 8 extra numbers beyond the 480th page. The extra numbers would be 481 to 488. In these, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once more in 484. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers, with each digit appearing 10 times in a group of 100. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times. So, for each 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Now, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds and then 88 extra numbers. For each complete hundred, we have 10 4's in the tens place. So, that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the remaining 88 numbers are from 400 to 488. In these, the tens digit is 0-8. The digit 4 in the tens place would be in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, right? So that's another 10 4's in the tens place. So total 4's in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but hold on, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, 440-449 is fully included in 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but actually, each page number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total 4's in hundreds place is 89.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units place 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. So total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. As before, every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing 1 8 in the units place. So, 48 * 1 = 48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers are 481-488. In these, the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each 100 numbers, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers. So, how many complete hundreds do we have? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the remaining 88 numbers are from 401-488. Wait, no, actually, the last partial hundred is from 401-488, but wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so perhaps I need to adjust. Wait, no, when considering the tens digit, from 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in each 100, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers. So, for 400-488, the tens digit cycles as 0-8. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488. That's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: 4 * 10 (from the first four hundreds) + 9 (from 400-488) = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me double-check. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8. So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 49 in total for the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds place contributes 0 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. So, units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. So, total 8's are 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, for 4's, I had 188, and for 8's, 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in counting the 8's in the tens place. Because in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times. So, 40 from the first four hundreds plus 9, which is 49. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's see:\n\n- 1-100: 80-89, that's 10 times.\n- 101-200: 180-189, another 10.\n- 201-300: 280-289, another 10.\n- 301-400: 380-389, another 10.\n- 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place, in 1-488, how many 8's? Each 10 numbers, 1 occurrence, so 48 full decades, 48, plus in 481-488, the 8 is in 488, so one more, total 49.\n\nAnd hundreds place, 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought the hundreds place for 8's would be 0, but let me check. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, yes, 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me just double-check the 4's count, because I feel like maybe I made a mistake there.\n\nSo, for 4's in units place: 48 full decades, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 484 has a units digit of 4, so 1 more, total 49.\n\nIn the tens place: for each hundred, 10 times. So, 4 hundreds, 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, but wait, no, for 4's in the tens place, it's when the tens digit is 4. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 more, making it 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nIn the hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a hundreds digit of 4, so 89.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, 4's: 188, 8's: 98, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the hundreds digit for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 4's there.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that's correct. 400 is the first page with hundreds digit 4, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's, since the book doesn't go beyond 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** \n     - Every 10 numbers, '4' appears once.

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately because the count might vary depending on whether we're looking at the units, tens, or hundreds place. Let's start with the units place. For the units digit, how often does 4 appear? Well, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (at page 4). From 11-20, it appears once (at page 14), and so on. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and a partial block of 8 pages (since 488 = 48*10 + 8). So, in each full block, 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the partial block from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear in the units place here? Yes, at page 484. So that's one more occurrence. So, total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but wait a second, page 484 is within the 481-488 range, so yes, that's correct. Now, moving on to the tens place. How often does 4 appear in the tens digit? In this case, the tens digit is 4 for an entire block of 10 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, each occurrence in the tens place contributes 10 times the digit 4. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's think: The first block is 40-49, which is within 1-99. Then, the next block would be 140-149, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, right? So, how many blocks is that? Let me count: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 instances where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 blocks * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but does the last block go up to 449? Because the book ends at 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. Now, what about the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in each of these 89 numbers, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds, which is 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears in page numbers from 1 to 488. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I need to count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places across all page numbers. Let's start with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in each block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so 8 appears once per block. So, how many full blocks of 10 are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks and a partial block of 8 pages. Each full block contributes 1 occurrence of 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Now, the partial block is 481-488, which is 8 numbers: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The units digits here are 1 through 8. So, does 8 appear in the units place here? Yes, at page 488. So, that's one more occurrence. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Now, moving to the tens place. The tens digit is 8 for the block 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488. So, how many full blocks are there? Let me check: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (another 10), 280-289 (another 10), 380-389 (another 10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last page). So, the first four blocks are full, each contributing 10 instances where the tens digit is 8, and the last block contributes 9 instances (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no, actually, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, each full block contributes 10, so 4 blocks give 40, and the last partial block contributes 9, so total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89: 10 numbers, tens digit 8. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Then 480-488: 9 numbers. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. Now, what about the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 times for the digit 8. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds, which is 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFirst, for the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full blocks of 10 (each contributing 1) = 48, plus 1 in the last partial block (484), so 49.\n\n- Tens place: 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10, so 5*10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full blocks of 10 = 48, plus 1 in the last partial block (488), so 49.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me check the tens place for 8's again. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them? Wait, 480 has tens digit 8, 481 has 8, up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8, correct. So, 9 occurrences. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's in the tens place, the last block is 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences, making it 5 blocks *10=50. Correct.\n\nAnd for the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 occurrences. Correct.\n\nYes, I think that's all correct. So, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is calculated by examining each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately. Similarly, the number of times the digit 8 appears is calculated. The difference between the counts of 4's and 8's gives the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** \n     - Each block of 10 numbers contributes 1 occurrence of 4.\n     - Total blocks of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full blocks and a partial block of 8 pages.\n     - Occurrences: 48 (from full blocks) + 1 (from 484) = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** \n     - Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49).\n     - Number of such blocks in 488 pages: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n     - Occurrences: 5 blocks * 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** \n     - The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488.\n     - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n     - Occurrences: 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** \n     - Each block of 10 contributes 1 occurrence of 8.\n     - Total blocks: 48 full + 1 partial (488).\n     - Occurrences: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** \n     - Each block of 100 has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 8 (e.g., 80-89).\n     - Number of full blocks: 4 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).\n     - Partial block: 480-488 (9 numbers).\n     - Occurrences: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** \n     - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place (book ends at 488).\n     - Occurrences: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should consider each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both 4 and 8. Let's start with the 4's.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in the units place. From 1 to 488, every group of ten numbers will have exactly one 4 in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. How many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the number of tens is 48 full tens (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens). But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last group is 480-488. So, in each of the 48 full tens, there's one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 times. But wait, does 488 count as part of the 48th ten? Let me check: 480-489 would be the 48th ten, but our book ends at 488, so yes, 484 is included, and 488 is the last page. So, 48 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. The 4 in the tens place occurs in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in the hundreds place, we have 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. But wait, 400-488 is part of the book. So, the ranges are:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. Counting the number of 8's in units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place. Similar to the 4's, every ten numbers have one 8 in the units place. From 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full tens, each contributing one 8. But wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 is included. So, 48 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. The 8 in the tens place occurs in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488 (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-489 would be the next range, but our book ends at 488, so it's only up to 488. So, let's count how many full ranges we have:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: Let's see, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9. So, in this range, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers. So, that's 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total in the tens place: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 in 480-488, so total 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. From 80-89: 10 numbers, yes. 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Then 480-488: 9 numbers. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97.\n\nWait, so 4's:187, 8's:97. So, the difference is 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 times. That's correct because from 1 to 488, every ten has one 4, so 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 times.\n\n- Tens place: 5 ranges (40-49, 140-149, etc.), each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 times, same as 4's.\n\n- Tens place: 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each with 10, so 40, plus 480-488 which is 9, so 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, 48 + 49 = 97.\n\nDifference: 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly for the tens place of 8's. The range 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, the 440-449 range is included, so that's 10 numbers.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I missed any ranges. For example, in the 4's tens place, after 440-449, the next would be 540-549, but that's beyond 488, so we stop at 440-449.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, after 380-389, the next would be 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers.\n\nSo, I think my counts are correct.\n\nThus, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. So, 187 - 97 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n1. **Units place:** Every group of ten numbers has one '4', resulting in 48 occurrences (from 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** '4' appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** '4' appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal '4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit '8':**\n1. **Units place:** Similar to '4', '8' appears 48 times (from 8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** '8' appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 40, and 480-488 adds 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No '8's appear since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal '8's: 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of '4's) - 97 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\nThus, there are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I can calculate how many 4's appear in each position and then add them up.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, we have 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 times. But wait, the last partial block is from 481 to 488, which is 8 pages. In this partial block, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in the pages 40-49, which is 10 times. So, in each block of 100 pages, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Now, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks of 100 pages each. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. Now, the remaining pages are from 401 to 488. In this range, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit is 8 for pages 481-488. Wait, but the tens digit being 4 would occur in pages 440-449. So, within the 401-488 range, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? From 440 to 449, that's 10 pages. So, adding that to the previous total, we have 40 + 10 = 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488. So, how many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place: Similar to the 4's, in each block of 10 pages, the units digit 8 appears once. So, for 488 pages, that's 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. The last partial block is 481-488, which includes page 488. So, in this partial block, the units digit 8 appears once (page 488). So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: In each block of 100 pages, the tens digit 8 appears in pages x80 to x89, which is 10 pages. So, for each 100 pages, 10 8's in the tens place. There are 4 full blocks of 100, so 4*10=40. Now, the remaining pages are 401-488. In this range, the tens digit 8 appears in pages 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, that's pages 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the remaining pages. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never is 8. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems lower than I expected. Let me double-check. Hmm, in the tens place, for the remaining pages 401-488, I considered the tens digit 8 as pages 480-488, which is correct. So, 9 times, right? So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct. Units place: 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, plus one more in the last partial block, so 49. Tens place: 49. So, total 8's are 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but when I calculated 4's, I got 187, and 8's as 98. So, the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me go through the 4's again. Units place: 48 times. Tens place: 50 times (40 from the first 400 pages, and 10 from 440-449). Hundreds place: 89 times (400-488). So, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's: Units place: 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, and then page 488 adds another, so 49. Tens place: 40 from the first 400 pages, and then 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly for 4's? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems right.\n\nWait, another way to check: Let's count the number of 4's in each digit place.\n\nUnits place: For each 10 pages, one 4. So, 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, plus in the last partial block (481-488), does 484 have a units digit 4? Yes, page 484. So, that's an extra 4 in the units place. Wait, so earlier I thought the last partial block didn't include a 4 in the units, but actually, 484 is within 481-488. So, that adds one more 4 in the units place. So, units place 4's would be 48 +1=49, not 48.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, units place for 4's: Each 10 pages contribute one 4. 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4. Then, the last partial block is 481-488, which includes page 484, which has a units digit 4. So, that's one more 4. So, total units place 4's: 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: Each 10 pages contribute one 8, so 48 full blocks, plus in the last partial block, 488 has a units digit 8. So, 48 +1=49.\n\nSo, correcting the 4's count: units place 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. So, total 4's: 49 +50 +89= 188.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, in the units place for 4's, I had 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, and then in the last partial block, 481-488, page 484 is included, so that's one more 4. So, units place 4's: 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for 4's: From 1-400, there are 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in pages 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 more. So, total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nWait, so earlier I had 187, but now it's 188. Which one is correct? Let me recount.\n\nWait, when I calculated units place 4's, I thought the last partial block didn't include a 4, but actually, it does. So, units place 4's: 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, units place: 49.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's total: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier by not counting the 4 in the units place in the last partial block. So, the correct total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure again.\n\nUnits place 4's: 48 full blocks (1-480) contribute 48 4's. Then, 481-488 includes page 484, which is a 4 in the units place. So, 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place 4's: 1-400: 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 40. Then, 401-488: pages 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 more. So, 40 +10=50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488: 89 pages, so 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full blocks (1-480) contribute 48 8's. Then, 481-488 includes page 488, which is an 8 in the units place. So, 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place: 1-400: 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 40. Then, 401-488: pages 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488), so 9 more. So, 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, so I think the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me think again to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, another way to count 4's: Let's consider each digit place separately.\n\nUnits digit:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place: floor(488/10)=48, plus if the last digit is >=4, we add 1 if the units digit is 4. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. Then, check if 488 mod 10 >=4? 488 mod10=8, which is >=4, so add 1 if the digit is 4. Wait, but 8 is not 4, so we don't add. Wait, no, that formula isn't correct. Wait, actually, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is floor(N/10) plus 1 if the units digit of N is >=d. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me think.\n\nActually, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is equal to:\n\nnumber = (N // 10) * 1 + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nWait, but for d=4, it's:\n\nnumber = (488 //10) *1 + (1 if (488 %10) >=4 else 0)\n\nWhich is 48 +1=49, since 8 >=4.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8:\n\nnumber = (488 //10)*1 + (1 if (488 %10)>=8 else 0)=48 +1=49.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to N is:\n\nnumber = (N // 100)*10 + extra\n\nWhere extra is:\n\nIf the tens digit of N is >d, add 10.\n\nIf the tens digit is equal to d, add (N %10 +1).\n\nIf the tens digit is less, add 0.\n\nWait, let's apply this.\n\nFor d=4 in tens place:\n\nN=488.\n\nN//100=4.\n\nSo, 4*10=40.\n\nNow, the tens digit of N is 8.\n\nSince 8 >4, we add 10. So, total 40 +10=50.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs only in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 40 (from 1-400) +10=50. So, correct.\n\nFor d=8 in tens place:\n\nN=488.\n\nN//100=4.\n\nSo, 4*10=40.\n\nTens digit of N is 8.\n\nSince 8=8, we add (N%10 +1)=8+1=9.\n\nSo, total 40 +9=49.\n\nWhich matches our earlier count.\n\nNow, for hundreds place:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in hundreds place from 1 to N is:\n\nIf d < hundreds digit of N: (hundreds digit -d) *100.\n\nIf d == hundreds digit: (N - d*100 +1).\n\nIf d > hundreds digit: 0.\n\nWait, for d=4:\n\nN=488.\n\nHundreds digit is 4.\n\nSo, it's (4 -4)*100 + (488 -4*100 +1)=0 + (488-400 +1)=89.\n\nSo, 89 times.\n\nFor d=8:\n\nHundreds digit of N is 4, which is less than 8, so 0 times.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188.\n\n8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should consider each digit place separately because the number of times a digit appears can vary depending on the place (units, tens, hundreds). Let me think. For the units place: In every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (at page 4). From 11-20, again once (at 14), and so on. Similarly, for the tens place: In every block of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 40-49, that's 10 pages where the tens digit is 4. Similarly, for the hundreds place: Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages. Wait, no, 488 - 400 + 1 is 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. Let me calculate each place separately for 4's. Units place: How many times does 4 appear in the units place from 1 to 488? Well, every 10 pages, 4 appears once. So, total number of 10s in 488 is 488 divided by 10, which is 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last decade is 480-488, which is 9 pages, but 488 is included. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 times. Wait, no, because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times. But wait, let me check: From 1-10: 4 once. 11-20: 4 once. ... 480-488: 4 once (at 484). So, yes, 48 times. Now, tens place: How many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Each block of 100 pages has 10 pages where the tens digit is 4. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many hundreds are there? From 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, but wait, 400 is the start of the hundreds place. Wait, actually, from 0-99, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49). Then from 100-199, another 10 times (140-149), and so on up to 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is a partial hundred. Let me calculate it properly. The number of complete hundreds is 4 (since 400 is the start of the 4th hundred). Wait, no. From 1-99: one set of tens. 100-199: another, 200-299: another, 300-399: another, and 400-488: partial. So, that's 4 complete hundreds (1-399) and then 400-488. Each complete hundred contributes 10 times 4 in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, for the partial hundred, 400-488: the tens digit is 4 for pages 400-409, 410-419, etc., but wait, 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit 4 appears in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, 480-488. Wait, no, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, 480-488. Wait, but 400-409 is 10 pages, same for each block. But 480-488 is only 9 pages, right? Because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place for 400-488, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 400-409 (10 times), 410-419 (10 times), ..., up to 480-488. Let me see how many full decades there are. From 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0-8. So, each decade is 10 pages. So, from 400-409: 10 pages, 410-419: 10, 420-429:10, 430-439:10, 440-449:10, 450-459:10, 460-469:10, 470-479:10, and 480-488: 9 pages. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, the tens digit is 4 in the decades where the tens digit is 4, which would be 440-449. So, that's 10 times. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. Therefore, total tens place 4's are 4 complete hundreds contributing 10 each (4*10=40) plus 10 in the 400-488 range, so 40+10=50 times. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, because the 400-488 range is part of the 4th hundred, so I think I might have double-counted. Let me correct this. From 1-399, each hundred contributes 10 times 4 in the tens place, so 3 hundreds would contribute 3*10=30, but wait, actually, from 1-99, it's 10 times, 100-199 another 10, 200-299 another 10, 300-399 another 10, so that's 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total tens place 4's are 40 +10=50. So, units place: 48 times, tens place: 50 times, and hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, hundreds place 4's: 89 times. Therefore, total 4's: 48 +50 +89=187. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. Units place: In every block of 10, 8 appears once. From 1-488, how many full decades are there? 488/10=48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, let me check: 1-10: 8 once, 11-20: 8 once, ..., 480-488: 8 once (at 488). So, 48 times. Now, tens place: In every block of 100, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times, e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc. From 1-488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 (1-399). Each contributes 10 times 8 in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. That's 9 pages (480-488), so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. Therefore, total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49. Now, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit 8 never appears. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0. So, total 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=97. Now, the number of 4's is 187 and the number of 8's is 97. So, the difference is 187 -97=90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. First, 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. Now, 8's: units=48, tens=49, hundreds=0. 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. Hmm, but let me think again. Did I count the tens place correctly for 4's? From 1-399, each hundred contributes 10 tens place 4's, so 4 hundreds would give 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, so total 50. That seems correct. For 8's, units=48, tens=49, so 97. Therefore, the difference is 90. But wait, I feel like that might not be right. Let me check the units place again. For 4's: units digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so 488/10=48.8, so 48 times. That seems correct. For 8's: same logic, 48 times. Now, tens place for 4's: 50 times, as above. Tens place for 8's: 49 times, because from 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times, plus 4*10=40, total 49. So, 8's total is 48+49=97. 4's total is 187. So, 187-97=90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but let me think again. Wait, in the hundreds place, 4's are from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. That's correct. So, yes, 4's: 48+50+89=187. 8's:48+49=97. 187-97=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once.\n   - Total occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\) times.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - From 1 to 399: \\( 4 \\times 10 = 40 \\) times.\n   - From 400 to 488: 440-449 contributes 10 times.\n   - Total occurrences: \\( 40 + 10 = 50 \\) times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488: 89 pages.\n   - Total occurrences: 89 times.\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 \\) times.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, 8 appears once.\n   - Total occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\) times.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - From 1 to 399: \\( 4 \\times 10 = 40 \\) times.\n   - From 400 to 488: 480-488 contributes 9 times.\n   - Total occurrences: \\( 40 + 9 = 49 \\) times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 800-899 are beyond 488, so 0 times.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 48 + 49 + 0 = 97 \\) times.\n\n**Difference:**\n- More 4's than 8's: \\( 187 - 97 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each place value one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra numbers. In each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So that's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial group, which is 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. Does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, 484. So that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? Let's see, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds. In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers. So that's 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, does the 400-488 range include another set? Yes, 400-409 would have 10 4's in the tens place, and 440-449 would have another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 20 more. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the tens place is the same as the number of times any digit appears in the tens place, which is 10 times for each hundred. So for each hundred, 10-19, 110-119, etc., but wait, 4 in the tens place would be 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. So that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each. So 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So total tens place 4's: 50.\n\nWait, but let me check. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers, so 5 ranges * 10 = 50. So yes, 50 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 times. So total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, for every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So that's one more. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100. So, the ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Let's see: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, that's 4 complete sets of 10 and one partial set of 9. So, the total tens place 8's: 4 * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges contributes 10, and the last contributes 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Wait, when I counted units place 8's, I got 49, and tens place 8's as 49, so total 98. Hmm, but let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10 + 9 = 49. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place of 4's, I had 50, which comes from 5 sets of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5*10=50. That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place of 4's, 49, which is 48 full decades plus one in the last partial decade. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 49, which is 48 full decades plus one in the last partial decade. Tens place: 49, as calculated. So, 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full groups of 10 (480 numbers), contributing 48 fours. In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 484 has a 4 in the units place, adding 1 more. Total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100. The ranges are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 fours, totaling 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Thus, 89 fours.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full groups of 10, contributing 48 eights. In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 488 has an 8 in the units place, adding 1 more. Total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100. The ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 eights each, totaling 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. The last range (480-488) contributes 9 eights. Total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers in the 800s, so no eights in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place one by one. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does that mean the 48th set ends at 480, and then we have 481-488. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 sets, each with a 4 in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so there's no additional 4 in the units place here. So, total 4's in the units place: 48.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for every block of 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does the last block, 440-449, go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 5 blocks, so 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNext, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nSo, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, every set of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. Then, from 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so that's an additional 8 in 488. So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for every block of 100 numbers, specifically from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block which has only 9 numbers (480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, let's count:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, then 180-189 is another 10, and so on. So, four blocks with 10 each, and the last one with 9. So, 4*10 +9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I thought 8's in the units place were 49 and in the tens place 49, so total 98. But let me double-check. \n\nWait, when counting the units place, I had 48 full decades (1-480), each contributing one 8, so 48, and then from 481-488, the units digit 8 appears once in 488, so total 49. That seems correct.\n\nFor the tens place, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9, so total 10*4 +9=49. So, yes, 49 in tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 +49=98.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I count the tens place, each block from 80-89, etc., each contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in tens place, so 10 8's. Similarly for 180-189, etc. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: as there are no page numbers from 800-899, so 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nWait, but earlier when I counted 4's, I got 187, and 8's are 98. So, the difference would be 187 -98=89. Hmm, but let me check if I did the 4's correctly.\n\nWait, for the 4's in the units place: from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see: every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. So, 484 is the last one before 488. So, 484 is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place: from 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 4's, so 50. Correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place: from 400-488: that's 89 numbers, each with 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, total 4's:48+50+89=187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's: units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds:0, total 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 -98=89.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly? Let me check the 8's in the tens place again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, units place: 48 full decades, plus one more in 488, so 49.\n\nSo, 49+49=98 8's.\n\nSo, 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 4's would have more, but no, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about another approach to verify. Maybe using a formula or another counting method.\n\nAnother way to count digits is to consider each digit place separately and calculate how many times each digit appears.\n\nFor the units place: For any digit d (other than 0), the number of times it appears in the units place up to n is floor((n)/10) + (1 if the units digit of n is >=d else 0). Wait, but that's a bit more complicated. Alternatively, for each digit place, we can calculate how many full cycles there are and the remainder.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to use the formula for digit counting. Let me recall that the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor(n/10) + (1 if n%10 >=d else 0). But actually, for digits 1-9, it's a bit different. Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many complete groups of 10 there are, and then see if the remaining digits include the target digit.\n\nWait, perhaps for the units place, the number of times 4 appears is:\n\nNumber of complete decades: floor(488/10)=48. Each contributes one 4, so 48. Then, check the last partial decade: 481-488. The units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (at 484). So, total 48+1=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, now I'm confused.\n\nWait, no, wait, earlier I thought that from 1-480, there are 48 4's in the units place, and from 481-488, no additional 4's. But now, using this method, it's 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4, so 48, and then the last partial decade (481-488) has 484, which is a 4 in the units place, so 48+1=49. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nFrom 1-480, how many 4's in the units place? Well, 480/10=48, so 48 times. Then, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total 49 4's in the units place. So, earlier I thought it was 48, but it's actually 49. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, that changes things. So, let me correct that.\n\nSo, units place for 4's: 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place: Let's recalculate.\n\nIn the tens place, the digit 4 appears in the tens digit for every block of 100 numbers, specifically in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place.\n\nSo, from 1-488, how many such blocks are there?\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149:10\n- 240-249:10\n- 340-349:10\n- 440-449:10\n\nBut wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 50.\n\nSo, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, from 400-488: that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nWait, that's different from before. Earlier I thought units place was 48, but now it's 49, so total 4's is 188.\n\nSimilarly, let's recalculate the 8's.\n\nUnits place: For 8's, from 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nNumber of complete decades: floor(488/10)=48. Each contributes one 8, so 48. Then, the last partial decade is 481-488. The units digits here are 1-8, so 8 appears once (at 488). So, total 48+1=49.\n\nTens place: For 8's in the tens place, the blocks are 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488.\n\nEach of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: As before, no 8's in the hundreds place, since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, total 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)=98.\n\nSo, now, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. So, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 187, but now it's 188. I must have made a mistake in the initial count.\n\nWait, let me double-check the units place for 4's. From 1-488, how many 4's in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 488/10=48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4. Then, the last partial set is 481-488, which includes 484, so that's one more 4. So, 48+1=49.\n\nSo, 49 in units place.\n\nIn the tens place, 5 blocks, each with 10 4's, so 50.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial count of 4's in the units place.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use a different method to count the 4's and 8's to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10)=48, plus 1 if 488%10 >=4. 488%10=8, which is >=4, so 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: floor(488/10)=48, plus 1 if 488%10 >=8. 488%10=8, which is equal to 8, so 48+1=49.\n\nFor the tens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)=4 (since 488/100=4.88), so 4 full hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place. But wait, actually, it's a bit more involved.\n\nWait, the formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the tens place up to n is:\n\ncount = 0\nfor each hundred block:\n    count += 10\nif the current hundred block is more than the target digit, add the extra\nif the current hundred block is equal to the target digit, add the remainder digits.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of it as:\n\nFor the tens digit, the number of times 4 appears is:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: floor(488/100)=4. Each complete hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, 4*10=40.\n\nThen, check the current hundred block: 488 is in the 400-499 block. The tens digit in this block goes up to 8 (since 488 is less than 499). So, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, add 10.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place:40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: floor(488/100)=4. Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, in the current hundred block (400-488), the tens digit goes up to 8 (since 488 is in 480-488). So, the 8's in the tens place are from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, add 9.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place:40+9=49.\n\nFor the hundreds digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488. So, that's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, 89 4's.\n\nNumber of 8's: The hundreds digit is 8 from 800-899, but since our book ends at 488, there are 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89, but now it's 90. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial count of units place for 4's. So, the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me try another approach: writing a small program or using a formula to count the digits.\n\nAlternatively, I can list out the counts:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal:188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal:98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each place value one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of ten and then an extra 8 pages. In each full group, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once in 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for every 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 1 to 488, the blocks are 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with units place: Similar to 4's, for every group of ten, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once in 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for every 100 numbers, specifically from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count the blocks:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. That's 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds place 8's. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. For each hundred, like 0-99, 100-199, etc., the tens digit 8 appears 10 times each. So, from 0-488, how many hundreds are there? Four hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the 400-499 hundred, but we only go up to 488. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times, except maybe the last one. Let's see:\n\n- 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10\n- 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10\n- 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10\n- 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10\n- 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9\n\nSo, 4 times 10 and 1 time 9, totaling 49. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place, since 800-899 isn't included, it's 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place was 49 and tens place was 49, so total 98. But when I counted 4's, I got 188. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something in the units place for 8's. Let me recount the units place for 8's. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? Well, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The first term is 8, the last term is 488, and the common difference is 10. The number of terms can be calculated as ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, that's correct, 49 times in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, as above, 49 times.\n\nSo, 49 + 49 = 98 8's.\n\nNow, for 4's, I had 188. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Then, in the tens place, I had 50, and units place 49, so 89 + 50 + 49 = 188. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 4,14,...,484. So, 484 is the last one. How many terms? From 4 to 484, step 10. Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting, especially in the hundreds place, I might have made a mistake. Let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should also do the same for 8's and then compare.\n\nStarting with the 4's:\n\n1. Units place: In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.). So, 48 groups would give 48 times 1, which is 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once more in 484. So, total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but hold on, 488 is the last page. So, when I take 488 divided by 10, it's 48 with a remainder of 8, so the last group is 481-488, right? So, the units digit for 484 is 4, so yes, that adds one more. So, units place for 4's: 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, looking at the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-488 is also there, but 480-488 is beyond 449, so does 440-449 count? Let me see. Each set of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-488, how many such blocks are there?\n\nFrom 0-99: 40-49, that's 10 numbers, so 10 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nFrom 100-199: 140-149, another 10 numbers, so another 10 times.\n\nFrom 200-299: 240-249, another 10 times.\n\nFrom 300-399: 340-349, another 10 times.\n\nFrom 400-488: Now, 440-449 would be the next block, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, total in tens place: 10 (from 40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449) = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 fall entirely within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, tens place for 4's: 50.\n\nWait, but let me check again. From 40-49: 10 numbers, 10 times 4 in tens place.\n\nSimilarly, each hundred block adds another 10. So, 4 hundreds (0-399) and then 400-488. Wait, 0-399 is four hundreds? Wait, no, 0-99 is the first hundred, 100-199 is the second, 200-299 is the third, and 300-399 is the fourth. Then 400-488 is the fifth hundred, but it's only up to 488, not 499. But 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's still 10 numbers. So, yes, 5 sets of 10, so 50. So, tens place: 50.\n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, looking at the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, but wait, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 onwards. So, from 400 to 488, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4. So, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the 8's:\n\n1. Units place: Similar to 4's, in the units place, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more in 488. So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so yes, 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, units place for 8's: 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, looking at the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let's see how many times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nFrom 0-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers, so 10 times 8 in the tens place.\n\nFrom 100-199: 180-189, another 10 times.\n\nFrom 200-299: 280-289, another 10 times.\n\nFrom 300-399: 380-389, another 10 times.\n\nFrom 400-488: Now, 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so in the tens place, each of these has an 8 in the tens digit. So, that's 9 times, not 10, because 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, adding up: 10 (80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 49 times. So, tens place for 8's: 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, looking at the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place for 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems off because earlier I thought maybe the hundreds place would have some, but no, since the book is only 488 pages, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full decades (1-480), each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, from 481-488, only 484 has a 4 in the units place, so 1 more. Total: 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow for the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, from 481-488, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so 1 more. Total: 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block. From 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, as I thought. So, 9 times 8 in the tens place. So, yes, 49 in tens place.\n\nWait, but another way to calculate the tens place for 8's: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except possibly the last one if it doesn't complete the 10. So, from 1-488, how many hundreds are there? 5 hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488.\n\nIn each of the first four hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit 8 appears 10 times each. So, 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nIn the fifth hundred, 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I thought about the hundreds place for 8's, I considered that 800-899 would have 8's in the hundreds place, but since the book only goes up to 488, that doesn't happen. So, 0 in hundreds place for 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400 is the first page with 4 in the hundreds place, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nAnd for 8's, it's 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to miss or double-count. Let me try a different approach to verify.\n\nAlternative approach: Instead of counting each digit place separately, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position again, but more carefully.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\n- Units place: For every 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many 4's in units place? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 has a 4. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: For every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, in each 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. From 1-488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units place: Similarly, for every 10 numbers, there's one 8 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), 488 has an 8 in the units place, so 1 more. Total: 49.\n\n- Tens place: For every 100 numbers, the tens digit is 8 in 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, from 1-488, how many complete hundreds? 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more. Total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: As before, no page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 90 seems like a lot. Let me see if there's another way to approach this, maybe by considering each digit position in more detail.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- For 4's: As before, 49 times.\n\n- For 8's: 49 times.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 4's: 50 times.\n\n- For 8's: 49 times.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- For 4's: 89 times.\n\n- For 8's: 0 times.\n\nSo, the total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for 8's, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times, correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about the tens place for 8's: How many times does 8 appear in the tens place from 1-488?\n\nIt's the number of times the tens digit is 8. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 exactly 10 times. So, for 4 complete hundreds (1-400), that's 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), how many times is the tens digit 8? From 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, from 1-488, we have 5 complete sets where the tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after checking again, I think the counts are accurate. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 400 is included, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about the hundreds place for 4's: The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nOkay, I think I've verified this enough times. The difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can use a systematic approach for each digit place.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in the units place. For the units digit, the 4 will appear once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4. That gives 48 times. But wait, in the last partial group from 481 to 488, the units digit goes up to 8, so the 48th group ends at 480, and then we have 481-488. So, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? No, because 488 ends with 8, so the units digit in 488 is 8, not 4. So, actually, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, right? Wait, but from 1 to 480, that's 48 groups of 10, each with a 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no additional 4's. So, total 4's in units place: 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 4 for numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last group would be 440-449, because 450-488 would have tens digits of 5,6,7,8,9, but 488 is the limit. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see: from 40-49, that's 10 numbers, so 10 times. Then 140-149, another 10, so 20. 240-249, another 10, so 30. 340-349, another 10, so 40. And 440-449, another 10, so 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, 5 groups of 10, each contributing a 4 in the tens place, so 50 times. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in each of these, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 times. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 400 to 488, that's correct. So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's printed: 187.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with units place. The 8 appears once every 10 numbers, similar to 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups. Each group contributes one 8, so 48 times. Now, the last partial group is from 481 to 488. The units digits go from 1 to 8, so in 488, the units digit is 8, so that's an additional 8. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 8's in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 8 for numbers from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last group is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nFrom 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times. 180-189: another 10, so 20. 280-289: another 10, so 30. 380-389: another 10, so 40. Now, 480-488: how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9). So, in the tens place, each of these contributes an 8, so 9 times. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 times. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I thought the 4's were 187 and 8's were 98, so the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89. But let me double-check my counting because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, when I was counting the units place for 8's, I had 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial group, from 481 to 488, the units digits go up to 8, so that's one more 8, making it 49. That seems correct.\n\nFor the tens place, I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's.\n\nNow, for the 4's, I had 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count or miss anything.\n\nWait, when counting the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place for 4's, I had 5 groups: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 groups \u00d710 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48 times, as there are 48 complete groups of 10 up to 480, and the last group from 481-488 doesn't add any more 4's in the units place. So, 48.\n\nAdding up, 48 +50 +89=187.\n\nFor 8's, units: 49, tens:49, hundreds:0, so total 98.\n\nSo, 187 -98=89.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting the hundreds place for 8's, since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for 8's, in 480-488, how many 8's are there? From 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8, so each number from 480 to 488 has 8 in the tens place. That's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 times. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I count the tens place for 8's, I have 4 groups of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and then 9 in 480-488, so 4\u00d710 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for units place, 48 full groups and 1 more in 488, so 49.\n\nSo, 8's total:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 4's:187, 8's:98, difference:89.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the hundreds place for 4's? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"
