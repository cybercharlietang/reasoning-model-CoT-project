    "text": " Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. The first is 8, the last is 488. How many are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Let me calculate how many terms: The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 +10(n-1)=488. Solving for n: 10(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Wait, how many numbers are in 480-488? That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) have 10 numbers each with 8 in the tens place, and the last set (480-488) has 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that can't be right because 49+49=98. Hmm, but let me check the tens place again. For the tens digit being 8, we have 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). That's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, so 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but let me check my counting again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me check that again. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. That seems correct. For the tens place, 4 in tens digit: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. That's correct. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? Let's see: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units place. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place, 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers as calculated earlier. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set has 10 numbers, and there are 5 sets.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - First four sets have 10 each, last set has 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is the 8th digit in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. Wait, but let me check: from 8 to 488, how many numbers with 8 in units place? The first is 8, then 18, 28,...,488. The number of terms can be calculated as ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last, so 480-488 is 9 numbers). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1=9. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, but let me check again. Units place:49, tens place:49, so total eights are 49+49=98. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me go through again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Checking fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for fours. I said from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So 5x10=50. That seems right. For eights in the tens place, from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49. That seems correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, total 98 eights. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is indeed 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

To find how many, divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48, but wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let's see: 8, 18, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is included.

Wait, no: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four sets (80-89, etc.) each have 10, and the last set has 9.

For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the tens place for eights again. When I was counting the tens place eights, I considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4*10 +9=49. That seems right. So, the difference is 188-98=90.

So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1. Let's compute that: (480)/10 = 48, so 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8. So, each set from 80-89, 180-189, etc., has 10 numbers. Let's count how many such sets are within 488. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9. So, each of the first four sets (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, and the last set (480-488) has 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait: 80-89 is in the first 100 pages, 180-189 in the next 100, etc. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, 49 + 49 is 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. I think I'm confident with this answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 numbers.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488. This range includes 89 numbers.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 numbers.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers here.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does that mean the units digit 8 occurs 49 times? Wait, let's check: starting from 8, then 18, 28,...,488. How many terms are there? The sequence is 8,18,...,488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. Let's set that equal to 488: 8 + 10(n-1) = 488 \u2192 10(n-1) = 480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49.

So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. And for the tens place in fours, it's 50, which comes from 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 5*10=50. That's correct. For eights, units place: 49, correct. Tens place: 49, correct because 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 4 full sets of 10, which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I feel like maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the units place for eights again. The last page is 488, so the units digit 8 occurs at 8,18,...,488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 +10(n-1)=488 \u2192 10(n-1)=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 eights in units place, correct. Similarly, for fours in units place: 4,14,...,484. Let me check: 484 is the last one. 484=4 +10(n-1) \u2192 10(n-1)=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Wait, but earlier I thought tens place for fours was 50, so that's 49+50=99, plus 89=188. So, yes, that's correct. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (4, 14, 24, ..., 484):**\n   - There are 49 occurrences (from 4 to 484, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens Place (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449):**\n   - Each hundred block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50 (5 blocks \u00d7 10).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place (400-488):**\n   - There are 89 occurrences (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (8, 18, 28, ..., 488):**\n   - There are 49 occurrences (from 8 to 488, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens Place (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488):**\n   - Each hundred block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block which has 9, totaling 49 (4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - There are 0 occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many full sets there are. Each full set (like 80-89) has 10 numbers, but the last set, 480-488, has only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, first four sets: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, the last set 480-488 has 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 480-488 which is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49. So, total eights: 49+49=98. Hmm, but wait, in the hundreds place, there are none, so total is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Wait, let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, so total eights are 98. So, the number of fours is 188 and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place. For the tens place, I considered 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. And units place: from 8,18,...,488, which is 49 numbers. So, 49+49=98 eights. Fours were 188. So, 188-98=90.

Since the book goes up to 488, yes, 480-488 is part of it. So, each of these blocks has 10 numbers except maybe the last one.

Wait, actually, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's the number of complete tens.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that seems off because I thought the tens place would have 49, but let me check again. Wait, in the tens place, each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place, except the last block (400-488), which only has 9 eights because it stops at 488. So, how many blocks are there? From 0-488, the hundreds digits go up to 4. So, the tens digit 8 occurs in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 4 full blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9, totaling 49. So, units place:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, total eights:49+49=98. Wait, but earlier I thought the units place had 49, and the tens place had 49, so 98 eights in total. Now, the fours had 188, so the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. But wait, let me double-check the counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's recount the fours: units place: from 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now, eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks is 10, and the last is 9, so 4*10 +9=49. So, units and tens each have 49, total 98. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly for fours. 400-488: that's 488-400+1=89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Correct. And for eights, the hundreds place is 0 because the book doesn't go beyond 488, so no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. Therefore, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of 4's: 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of 4's: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of 8's: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49.

So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me check the tens place for 4's again. I had 5 sets of 10 in the tens place for 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place. Yes, that's correct. And the hundreds place for 4's is from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place for 4's: 49, as calculated earlier. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's, units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0, total 98. So, 188-98=90.

Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many that is. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which might be shorter. Let me count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, I think that's correct.

    "text": " Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is 488, so the units digit is 8, so that's included.

So, that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So total is 10*4 +9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check again. Units place: from 8,18,...,488: 488 is 488, so how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So units place:49. Tens place: as above, 49. So total eights:49+49=98. That's correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.

Let me check that again. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's five sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nFor eights, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's five sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49.

Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many 8s in the units place? Let's see: the first is 8, the next is 18, ..., up to 488. To find how many, we can calculate how many numbers are there where the units digit is 8. The last one is 488, which is 488 - 8 = 480, so 480/10 = 48, but since we include both 8 and 488, it's 49 numbers.

Yes, but since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 have 8 in the tens place. So, let's count these blocks.

So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49 eights.

So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with inclusive counts. For units place of 4: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. For tens place of 4: each hundred block has 10, and there are 5 blocks (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit being 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in each block, 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks, 10 each: 50. Correct. For hundreds place of 4: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place is 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is the 49th term. So, 49. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Number of occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 count? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 would be part of that. So, each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last block which is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed. Wait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yep, that seems correct.

Let me recheck the fours first. Units place: from 4,14,24,...,484. That's every 10 numbers starting at 4. So, the number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.
