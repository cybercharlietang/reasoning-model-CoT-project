    "text": " Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is okay, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. So, 480-488 is part of the book. So, how many sets of 10 numbers have 8 in the tens place? Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 40 eights. But wait, in the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, that's 9 more eights in the tens place. So, total eights in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, which is 49. Wait, no, because 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so it's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Hmm, but wait, let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the eights in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 40. Then, 480-488: that's 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40 +9=49. That seems correct. So, total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Fours:188. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for fours was 89, but that seems correct because from 400 to 488 is 89 numbers. Wait, 488-400+1=89. Yes, that's correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check the eights again. When I count the units place, from 8,18,...,488, that's 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. So, that's correct. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights:49+49=98. Fours:188. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. I think I was just overcomplicating it, but I think the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This is every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - This is 89 numbers, so 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This is every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 40, and 480-488 adds 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

The last one is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, let's see: each hundred block (except maybe the last one) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me check the tens place again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. So, total eights: 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

    "text": " Let me check the units place again. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours. But wait, does 488 include another 4 in the units place? 488 ends with an 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So yes, 49 fours in the units place. Okay, that's correct. Now, moving on to counting the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, 8,18,...,488. Let's see: 488 is 8*61, but wait, no, 8*61 is 488. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, the count is floor(488/10) + 1? Wait, no, because 488 is included. Let me think. The first number is 8, which is 8*1, then 18=8*2, ..., 488=8*61. So, there are 61 numbers where the units digit is 8. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 8*61 is 488, but 8*1=8, 8*2=16? Wait, no, 8*2 is 16, but 16 is 16, which is 16, but in the units place, 16 has a 6 in the units place, so I'm confused. Wait, no, the units digit being 8 occurs every 10 numbers, regardless of the tens digit. So, 8,18,28,...,488. So, starting at 8, each step is +10. So, how many terms are there? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. We need the last term to be <=488. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 <=488. Let's solve for n: (n-1)*10 <=480 => n-1 <=48 => n<=49. So, n=49. So, there are 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, that seems a bit low. Let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens:49, so total 98 eights. Hmm, okay. Now, the number of fours was 188, and the number of eights was 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place. I had 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. That seems correct. Similarly, in the units place, 49 eights. So, total eights:98. Fours:188. Difference:90. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This is 49 occurrences (since 484 is the 49th term).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - This is 89 occurrences (488 - 400 + 1).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This is 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - This is 49 occurrences (10 each in the first four sets and 9 in the last).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

From 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8, but the hundreds digit is 4. So, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49.

That seems correct. So, total fours are 188, and total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, 188 - 98 = 90.

That's correct. Similarly, for fours in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, which is correct because 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Each block from 80-89, 180-189, etc., has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). So, the tens place for 8 in the hundreds place (400-488) only has 9 occurrences in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one block of 9 (480-488).

The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights here. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page).

But wait, let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct.

Wait, but in the hundreds place, 400-488 is only part of the 400-499 block, so maybe I should check if I counted correctly. Wait, when counting the tens place, each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. That seems correct. Similarly, for eights in the tens place, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 49 in total. So, I think my counts are correct. Therefore, the difference is 188 -98=90.

How many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me check how many full sets there are. Each 100 numbers have a set of 10 where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that right? Let me list them: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, 8,18,...,488. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many sets of 100 have 8 in the tens place. Each block contributes 10 numbers. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-489 would be 10, but we only go up to 488, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, maybe that's correct, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, in the hundreds place for fours, I counted 89 numbers from 400-488. Let me confirm: 488-400+1=89. Yes, that's correct. For the tens place in fours, I had 50, which is 5 sets of 10 (40-49, 140-149, etc.), each contributing 10 fours. That's 5*10=50. That's correct. For eights in the tens place, I had 49, which includes 4 full sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and 9 in 480-488. So, 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. Units place for both digits had 49 each, which seems correct because 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers for each digit in units place. So, I think my counts are accurate.

Yes, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such blocks we have. From 1-400, we have 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389). Each contributes 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488).

The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-489 would be the next set, but 488 is the last page. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers? Let me check: 480 is the first, then 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers. So, the tens place for 8 is 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488). Wait, but 480-488 is actually 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so yes, 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8.

Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights: 49+49=98. Wait, but earlier for fours, I had 188 fours, and eights are 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for eights. Specifically, in the tens place, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, which is 4*10 +9=49. So, that seems correct. So, total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, fours are 188, eights are 98, so 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly for the units place? For fours, units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Similarly, for eights, units place:8,18,...,488. So, same calculation: ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units place. So, that part is correct. For the tens place, fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50 fours in tens place. For eights, tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 4 full blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. Hundreds place: fours:400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Eights: no numbers in hundreds place, as the book ends at 488. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Total eights:49+49=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yep, that seems correct. I think I did everything right. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. So, how many terms? The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488. Let's solve for n: 10(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Each full set (like 80-89) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, let's count how many full sets we have and then the partial set. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 full sets (each contributing 10 eights) and one partial set with 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it.

So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my counts again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for eights. Let me recount the tens place for eights. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, etc.) have 10 numbers, so 4 sets \u00d710=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total is 40+9=49. That's correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. So, fours are 188, eights are 98. The difference is 90.

    "text": " Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I need to count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places from 1 to 488. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the units place. So, from 8 to 488 in steps of 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80s, 180s, 280s, 380s) plus 9 in 480s. So, 4*10=40 +9=49.

Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so how many such numbers are there? Let's see: 8,18,28,...,488. To find the count, divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Let's calculate how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except maybe the last block. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9 =49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) =90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Let me just quickly check if I didn't make any mistakes in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

    "text": " Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll go through each digit position again: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, so let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? Each block from 80-89, 180-189, etc., has 10 numbers. But the last block, 480-488, only has 9 numbers because 489 is beyond 488. So, for the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), that's 4 sets of 10, which is 40 eights. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's 9 more eights in the tens place. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Wait, but let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place:49. So, 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 4,14,...,484. That's (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. Correct. Total fours:49+50+89=188. For eights: units place:8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.

Let's see how many there are. The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's see how many sets there are. Each 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, as 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, number of fours is 188, number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for eights. Let me recount the tens place for eights. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds. So, 98 eights. So, the difference is indeed 90. Wait, but I just thought of something. When counting the hundreds place for fours, I included 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For the hundreds place for eights, since the book only goes up to 488, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.

    "text": " Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? The last one is 488, so dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 would have 8 in the tens place. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place:49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for 8. When I counted the tens place for 8, I included 480-488 as 9 numbers. Let me confirm: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, correct. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 49. So, eights in tens place:49. Units place:49, so total eights:98. Fours:188. 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. I think that's the answer. Wait, but let me just cross-verify. Maybe I can think of another way to count. For example, for each digit position, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear. Alternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a systematic approach. Let me try that. For a given digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. For units place:\n   - The number of times d appears is floor(n / 10) + (1 if the remainder is >= d else 0).\n   But in our case, n=488, so for units place, it's floor(488/10)=48, and since 488 mod 10=8 >=4, so 48+1=49 fours. Similarly for eights, floor(488/10)=48, and 8>=8, so 48+1=49 eights.\n\n2. For tens place:\n   - The formula is a bit more involved. The number of times d appears in the tens place is:\n     - Let q = floor(n / 100)\n     - Let r = n / 10 % 10\n     - count = q * 10\n     - if r > d, count +=10\n     - else if r ==d, count += (n %10 +1)\n     So, for d=4 in tens place:\n     q = floor(488/100)=4\n     r = (488 /10) %10 = 8\n     So, count=4*10=40\n     Since r=8 >4, count +=10 \u2192 50 fours in tens place.\n     Similarly, for d=8 in tens place:\n     q=4\n     r=8\n     count=4*10=40\n     Since r=8 >=8, count += (8 +1)=9 \u2192 40+9=49 eights in tens place.\n\n3. For hundreds place:\n   - For d=4, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488. So, numbers from 400-488: 488-400+1=89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in hundreds place.\n   - For d=8, there are no numbers in 800-899, so 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n- Fours: units(49) + tens(50) + hundreds(89) = 188\n- Eights: units(49) + tens(49) + hundreds(0) = 98\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 count? Yes, because the book has 488 pages. So, how many such numbers are there? Starting from 8, each 10 numbers. The last one is 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1. Let's compute that: (488 - 8) is 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, 49+49 is 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Let me just quickly verify if I missed anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

    "text": " Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll go through each digit position again: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many terms? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8*49=482? Wait, no, 8*49=482? Wait, no, 8*49 is 392. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28,..., up to 488. So, the sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 +10(n-1) = 488. Solving for n: 10(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480 to 489 would be 10, but the book ends at 488, so it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block (400-499). But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 400-488. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many blocks? From 0-99: 80-89:10 numbers. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for fours. Let me check again. For fours in the tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Yes, that's correct. And in the hundreds place, 400-488:89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place: 4,14,...,484. As we saw earlier, that's 49 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. So, 98 eights. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

For tens place, each hundred has 10, so 4 hundreds places (400s, 300s, 200s, 100s, and 0-99) but wait, actually, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, so in each hundred, there's a 4 in the tens place for 10 numbers. So, from 1-488, how many hundreds are there? 488 is in the 400s, so we have 400-488, which is part of the 400s. So, how many complete hundreds? 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's four sets where the tens digit is 4. Each set contributes 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 5 sets. Hmm, I think I made a mistake there. Let me correct that. Wait, actually, from 0-99, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, 100-199: 140-149, another 10. 200-299:240-249, 10. 300-399:340-349, 10. 400-488:440-449, which is 10 numbers, since 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours in the tens place. So, my initial calculation was correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. So, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is 48*10 + 8, which is 488. So, the number of 8's in the units place is 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, since the book goes up to 488, does 480-489 count? Wait, 480-489 would be in the 400s, but 488 is the last page. So, 480-488 is part of the tens place 8. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, that's 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Wait, let me check that again. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights =90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. Similarly, for 4's, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. Units place for 4's: 49, tens place:50, hundreds:89, total 188. For 8's, units:49, tens:49, total 98. So, 188-98=90. I think that's correct.

The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 8th number in the 488-497 range, but wait, 488 is the last page. So, actually, the number of 8's in the units place would be from 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me calculate how many numbers that is. The formula is floor((488 - 8)/10) + 1. So, (488-8)=480, 480/10=48, so 48 +1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 eights except the last one, which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Let me count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.

So, that part is correct. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) plus 9, totaling 49. So, 49 in tens place.\n\nUnits place: 49, tens place:49, so total eights:98.\n\nFor fours, we had 188. So, 188 - 98 = 90.

How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 8th occurrence in the units place for the 480-488 range. So, to calculate, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48, but wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. Wait, no: 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me see: 488 is the 49th term because 488/10 is 48.8, but since we start counting from 0, it's actually 49 terms. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488.

Units place: 49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total eights: 49+49=98. So, fours are 188, eights are 98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count or miss any numbers. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct.

    "text": " Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, not 10, because the book ends at 488. So, let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, 188 - 98 is 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yep, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. Wait, but 488 is included, so that's correct. So, units place:49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, except maybe the last one. Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds), we determine that the digit 4 appears 188 times and the digit 8 appears 98 times. Subtracting these gives a difference of 90 more fours than eights.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."
