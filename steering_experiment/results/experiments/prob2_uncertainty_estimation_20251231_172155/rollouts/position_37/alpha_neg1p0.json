So, 49 occurrences, just like the fours in the units place. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28,..., up to 488. So, how many terms in this sequence? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. Let's solve for n: (n-1)*10 \u2264 480 \u2192 n-1 \u2264 48 \u2192 n \u2264 49.

    "text": " Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see, the last number is 488, which is in the units place as 8. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but including 488, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Each block from 80-89, 180-189, etc., has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the hundreds go up to 4. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 = 8, but including both ends, it's 9 numbers. So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me list them: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4 and 8. For fours: Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10,140-149:10,240-249:10,340-349:10,440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place:400-488:89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct. For eights: Units place:8,18,...,488. The last one is 488, which is the 49th term because (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. To find how many terms there are, I can compute (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it.

So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.

Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is included? Let's see. The last number is 488, so the units digit is 8. So, starting from 8, every 10 numbers up to 488. How many times does 8 appear in the units place? The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many numbers is that? Let's calculate: The number of terms in the sequence 8,18,28,...,488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 +10(n-1) = 488. Solving for n: 10(n-1) = 480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488.

Yep, that's correct. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488-400+1=89. So, that's correct. And for eights, in the tens place, I had 49. Wait, but let me check the units place for eights again. From 8,18,...,488. So, the last one is 488. How many terms are there? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10=488. So, (n-1)*10=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, yes, 49 eights in units place. Similarly, for tens place, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90.

So, yeah, the total is 188 fours and 98 eights, so 90 more fours.

Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence is at 488. How many such numbers? Let's see, starting at 8, each step of 10. The number of terms can be calculated as (488 - 8)/10 + 1. So, (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block, which might be shorter. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

The last one is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets, so 49 numbers (including 8 and 488). Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488.

So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 would have 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let's count each block: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me check the units place for 4's and 8's again. For 4's in units place: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484-4)/10 +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Similarly for 8's in units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. For tens place, 4's: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449). 5*10=50. Correct. For 8's in tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 4 full blocks (80-89, etc.) and one partial block (480-488). Each full block is 10, so 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, 49. Correct. Hundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct. Hundreds place for 8's: none, since the book ends at 488. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Total eights:49+49=98.

And for the tens place of fours, 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Units place: every 10 numbers, from 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place:49, tens place:49. So, 98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

Let's see, the last number with 8 in units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, which would give 48 eights. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each of these sets contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through the counts again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.

How many? Let's see, the last one is 488, which is 48*10 +8=488. So, starting from 8 (which is 0*10 +8), up to 488 (48*10 +8). So, that's 49 numbers (0 to 48 inclusive), so 49 eights in the units place. So, that's correct. So, total eights are 49+49=98. Fours are 49+50+89=188. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the tens place for fours? For fours in the tens place, it's 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, which is 50 fours. Correct. And in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units:49, tens:49, so 98.

How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, 8,18,...,488. So, that's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is okay, but 480-489 would be up to 488.

I had 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's 4 sets of 10 and 9, totaling 49. Correct.

Yes, because the book ends at 488. So, how many such numbers are there? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. How many terms? The number of terms can be found by (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49.

Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let's count each block: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers.

Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Now, to find how many more fours than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in the number of terms. Let's go through the fours again. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 488-400+1=89. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. Number of terms: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98. Therefore, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Correct. And for the eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place for that last block. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, yes, the total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, 188-98=90.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me make sure. Units:49, tens:49, so total 98. That seems right. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers. Wait, did I do that right? Let me check again. Fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers.

Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, that's 9 instead of 10 because 489 isn't included. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total.

Let me see how many there are. The last page is 488, which ends with an 8. So, starting at 8, each 10 numbers adds another 8 in the units place. So, the number of such numbers is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8 is the first, then 18 is the second, up to 488 being the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full hundred block (e.g., 0-99, 100-199, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480 is the first, then 481, 482, ..., up to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and 9 from 480-488.

The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48 occurrences. But wait, 488 is included, so let's see: from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers.

Tens place for fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5 sets: 5*10=50. Correct. Tens place for eights: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, first four sets have 10 each, last set has 9. 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place for fours: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. Hundreds place for eights: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488.

So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This is 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This is 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This is 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count each block: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last one). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the tens place for fours. Let me check that again. When counting the tens place for fours, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's five sets of 10, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. For eights in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers (480-488). So, 4*10 + 9=49. That seems correct too. So, the difference is indeed 90. But wait, let me make sure I didn't double-count any numbers. For example, in the units place, 4 and 8 are separate, so no overlap there. In the tens place, same thing. And hundreds place only for fours. So, I think the calculation is correct. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488).\n\nTotal fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal eights = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. To find how many, I can take 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one. So, 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? So, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place for that last set. So total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, when I counted the units place for 4's, I got 49, and for 8's, I also got 49. But when I added up the tens and hundreds places, I had 50 for 4's tens and 89 for 4's hundreds, totaling 139, plus 49 units makes 188. For 8's, tens place was 49, units 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me check the units place for 4's again. From 4 to 484, every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last term - first term)/common difference) +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, correct.\n\nFor 8's units place: 8,18,...,488. Similarly, (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block of 100 has 10, and there are 5 blocks (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nTens place for 8's: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 4 full blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 8's: none, since the book ends at 488. Correct.\n\nSo, total fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal eights:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - 4 full blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Count: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would suggest 49 numbers, but wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 count? Yes, because it's a valid page number. So, from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers, so that's (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me check each set: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place.

So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, let me just go through this again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right.
