    "text": " So that's 5 blocks of 10 numbers each, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many such blocks. Each block is 10 numbers, so 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, the first four blocks have 10 each, and the last block has 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counting. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. I think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check the last set: 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of fours is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but wait, let me check again because I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. So, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many full sets there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours: 188, total eights: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount the fours: Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is (last - first)/step +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, eights: Units place:8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. So, (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. So, the answer should be 90. But wait, let me think again. Did I count correctly? Because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the hundreds place, it's easy to miscount. For example, in the hundreds place for fours, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct. Similarly, in the tens place for fours, 5 sets of 10, so 50. Units place, 49. So, 188 fours. For eights, units and tens each have 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Total occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = \\frac{480}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences.  \n   - Total blocks contributing: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   - Total occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     5 \\times 10 = 50\n     \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.  \n   - Total numbers:  \n     \\[\n     488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n     \\]\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 50 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 89 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Total occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = \\frac{480}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block.  \n   - Total occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     4 \\times 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49\n     \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book only goes up to 488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 0\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 49 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 0 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**  \n\\[\n188 - 98 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers except possibly the last one. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4x10=40, plus 9=49.

    "text": " So that's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 40-49 is the first set, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? Well, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but wait, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place.

Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which would give 48 eights. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 eights in the units place. Wait, 8,18,28,...,488: how many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. Solving for n: (n-1)*10 = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers (like 1-100) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, checking the fours: units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now, eights: units place: 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,...,480-488: 4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and 480-488: 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place: 0. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I feel like I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check: from 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488 - 400 +1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right. Similarly, in the tens place for fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Units place for fours: 4,14,...,484. 484 is 48*10 +4, so 49 numbers. Correct. For eights, units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is 48*10 +8, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, the total fours are 188, eights are 98. The difference is 90.

Now, let me add up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 count? Yes. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds an 8 in the units place. How many such numbers are there? The first is 8, and the last is 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, that's 480-488: that's 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4\u00d710=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units place: 4,14,...,484: that's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449: 5 sets \u00d710=50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems right. For the 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488: 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488: 4 sets of 10 (40) + 9=49. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98. Then 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, contributing 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that: 49 + 50 = 99, then 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. Let's count how many blocks there are. Each block is 10 numbers. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. Wait, let me check that again. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4 times 10 is 40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but wait, 488 is included, so 488 is the last number.

How many such numbers? Let's see, starting at 8, each subsequent 10 numbers adds another 8 in the units place. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? Let me calculate how many tens are there. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. The first is 8 (which is 8 + 0*10), the next is 18 (8 +1*10), up to 488 (8 +48*10). So, that's 49 numbers.

But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit being 8 in the tens place. So, each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book stops at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many eights in the tens place? 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) contributing 9 eights. So, that's 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait, let me check again. 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 x 10 = 40. Then 480-488: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the range 400-488. So, every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, let's add them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188.

Let me think: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so yes, 9 eights in the tens place for that block. So, total eights in tens place: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 eights, so 4 x 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. So, that's correct. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours: units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. Eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = **49** occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in 800-899 exist.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but wait a second. Let me check if 440-449 is fully within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me verify. Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Let me recount the units place. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 fours. But wait, in each set, the 4 occurs exactly once, right? So, 48 times, but then the last partial set is 481-488, which includes 484, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count. Each set of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 numbers instead of 10. So, total tens place eights: 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (since 484 is the last one).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n   - There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 occurrences.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in numbers from 400-488.\n   - There are 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (since 488 is included).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n   - The first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - The last block (480-488) contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but hold on. The last page is 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, contributing 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 380-389 is included, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each block of 100 contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. But wait, 480-488 is part of the book. So, in the tens place, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, and there are 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, that's 9 more eights in the tens place. So, total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me double-check. The first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Wait, but let me check: 40-49: yes, 10 numbers. 140-149: yes, another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. Let's see how many numbers that is. The first 8 is at 8, then every 10 numbers after that. The last one is 488, which is 48*10 +8, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is the 49th because 8,18,...,488: that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 eights, and the last block contributing 9 eights. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98.

So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total.

Wait, but 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers), 100-199: 180-189 (10), 200-299: 280-289 (10), 300-399: 380-389 (10), and 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, because 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in blocks of 100 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).  \n   Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   5 \\times 10 = 50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n   \\]\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in blocks of 100 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).  \n   The last block (480-488) has 9 numbers.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   0\n   \\]\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference:**  \n\\[\n188 - 98 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So that's 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, it's included. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is included, and 488 is the last. So, 400 to 488 is indeed 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit can be 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, so the first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since 484 is the 49th occurrence).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since 488 is the 49th occurrence).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences for the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).\n   - The last block (480-488) contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place, but actually, since 488 is the last page, the last units 4 is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 fours in units. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. So, how many hundreds blocks are there? From 1-488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, the last block is 400-488, which includes 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488: that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Numbers ending with 8: 8,18,28,...,488. How many are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but the last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many blocks? From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-489 is beyond 488, so it's only up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, number of fours is 188, number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. Difference is 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for fours. Wait, when counting the tens place for fours, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. That seems right. For eights, in the tens place, it's 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, 5 blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, totaling 49. That seems correct. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I feel like I might have made a mistake because 488 is a high number, and maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me check units place for fours again. Units place fours: from 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is (last - first)/step +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 fours in units. Correct. Tens place for fours: 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, 10 each: 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 8,18,28,...,488. Last term is 488, which is 8 + 10*(n-1)=488. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in units. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9: 49. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place.

The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except maybe the last one if it's cut short. Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488-480+1=9). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 in all of them. So, for 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place.

So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but wait, the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights.

Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are.

So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total in tens place: 4\u00d710 +9=40+9=49 eights. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, yes, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed.

    "text": " So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full decades, so 48 occurrences, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488. Wait, 488 is the 49th number because starting from 0, the first 8 is at 8, which is the 1st, then 18 is 2nd, up to 488 being the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total in the tens place is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but hold on, from 40-49 is the first set, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but we have to check if 488 is included. 8*61=488, so 61 numbers? Wait, that can't be right because 8 appears once every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's think differently. The first 8 is at 8, then every 10 numbers after that. So, the number of 8's in units place is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 is exactly 48*10 + 8, we add 1 more, so 49. Wait, no: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but since 488 is included, we have 48 full tens and then an extra 8 at 488, making it 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 40+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Wait, but let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds: 0. So, 49+49=98 eights. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, let me double-check that addition: 49 + 50 is indeed 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, I need to count the number of 8's in the same range. Let me do the same process for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we include 488, it's 49 numbers. Wait, no, let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms can be calculated as floor((488 - 8)/10) + 1. So, (488 - 8) is 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, let's count how many blocks of 100 have 8 in the tens place. Each block contributes 10 numbers. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 + 1 = 9, yes. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 4 x 10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that seems a bit low. Let me check again. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. So, total eights are 49 + 49 = 98. Hmm, okay. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems. Let me re-examine the fours first. **Fours:**\n- Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct.\n- Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50.

Number of terms: (488 - 8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct.\n- Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4 x 10 =40, plus 9 is 49. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 0, as before.\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** '4' appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400 to 488, there are 89 numbers with '4' in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488), totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488 (9 numbers). This gives 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No page numbers have '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So that's 5 blocks of 10 numbers each, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, so that's 20, then 240-249 is 30, 340-349 is 40, and 440-449 is 50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but let me make sure: 400 is the first, then 401, ..., up to 488. So, yes, that's 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. So, total number of 4's is the sum of 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 +50 is 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through each digit position again: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488, so how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8 appears at 8,18,...,488. So, units place has 49 eights. Wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. The number of terms is given by (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10 because 489 is beyond 488). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 +9 = 40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me verify: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of fours is 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers. The first occurrence is 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but again, we have to check if 488 is included. 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book only goes up to 488, we have to check how many numbers are in 480-488. Let's break it down: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289:10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488: 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and 9 numbers in 480-488. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of eights is 98. Now, to find how many more fours than eights there are: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that's a big difference. Let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems a bit high, but maybe that's correct. Let me verify each step again. For fours: units place: 4,14,...,484. 484 is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484 \u2192 10*(n-1) = 480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 fours in units. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours. Total: 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place: 0. Total eights: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.

So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? Each set is 10 numbers, except the last one which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights printed: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed.

Wait, but wait, 488 is the last page, so yes, 8 appears in the units place 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many sets? Each set is 10 numbers, so 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place contributes 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Wait, 49+49 is 98, correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - There are 49 such numbers (from 4 to 484).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - This range includes 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n\n**Total 4's:**\n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - There are 49 such numbers (from 8 to 488).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in the book have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:**\n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, yes, and 99 + 89 is indeed 188. Hmm, but let me double-check because that seems high. Wait, 4's in units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Okay, maybe that's correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full decades, each contributing an 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, 8,18,...,488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets of 100 have 8 in the tens place. From 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check again. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. That seems right. For the tens place, 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 5*10=50. Correct. Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place:8,18,...,488:49 numbers. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488: each set except the last has 10, last has 9, so 4*10 +9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Wait, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The last number is 488, so how many are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8. Let's count how many blocks: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 4*10=40, and 480-488 contributes 9, so total 40+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the fours: units place: 4,14,...,484: that's 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449: 5 sets, each 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For the eights: units place: 8,18,...,488: 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for eights. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: since 488 is the last page, how many numbers are there? 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, the difference is 188-98=90.

    "text": " So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 40-49 is in the first 100, then 140-149 in the next, and so on up to 440-449. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, let me add up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 count? Well, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, how many sets are there? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, that's 480-488 inclusive, which is 9 numbers because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, that's 4\u00d710=40 and 9, so total 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but wait, 400 is the first number, and 488 is the last. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many numbers? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct. Tens place: Each hundred block has 10 fours in the tens place. There are 5 hundred blocks where the tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, now let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Wait, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). Let me count how many blocks: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9=49. Wait, let me confirm. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that's 98 eights. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours. Units place: 49, correct. Tens place: 50, correct. Hundreds place: 89, correct. 49+50=99, +89=188. Eights: Units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, seems right. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for eights. When I was counting the tens place for eights, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers. So, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's correct. So, 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one block of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct. So, the total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Fours are 188. So, 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " So that's 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number is 488, so how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except possibly the last one. From 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 eights (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

    "text": " So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 count as 10 numbers? Yes, because 440 is included, and 449 is the last one. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but I'm only considering page numbers up to 488, so yes, 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, let me add up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Let's go through each place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, etc.) and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: from 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. Yes, that's 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Wait, in the units place, I thought it was 49 fours, but let me recount. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That's 48 fours. But then, in the 49th set, which is 480-488, the units digit 4 appears once at 484. So, total units fours: 48 +1 = 49. That's correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, so from 1-488, how many hundreds? 488 is less than 500, so we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. Wait, but 400-488 is part of the hundreds place 4. Wait, but for the tens place, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 1-100: 40-49, that's 10. 101-200: 140-149, another 10. 201-300: 240-249, 10. 301-400: 340-349, 10. Now, 401-488: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens fours: 10 * 5 = 50. That's correct. Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, in the 49th set, 480-488, the units digit 8 is at 488. So, total units eights: 48 +1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets. Each hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 480 is the first, then 481, ..., up to 488. So that's 9 numbers. So, total tens eights: 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds eights: 0. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, number of fours is 188, number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188. Eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, total 98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Wait, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. And in the tens place for fours, we had 50, which includes 440-449 as the fifth set, which is correct. For eights, in the tens place, I had 40 from the first four hundreds, and then 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Units place for eights: 49, which is correct because 488 is included. So, the total eights are 49+49=98. So, the difference is indeed 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. Alternatively, maybe I overcounted the fours in the tens place. Let me see: from 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 50. That's correct. So, I think my counts are accurate, and the difference is 90.

So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, how many such numbers? Let's see, starting at 8, each 10 numbers. The last one is 488.

But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place.

So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in page numbers 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10.\n   - The number of terms is calculated by: \\( \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for all page numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - This is \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\) occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:**\n\\[ 49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 50 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 89 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 188 \\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in page numbers 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This sequence has \\( \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49 \\) terms.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n\n**Total 8's:**\n\\[ 49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 49 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 0 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 98 \\]\n\n**Difference:**\n\\[ 188 \\, (\\text{4's}) - 98 \\, (\\text{8's}) = 90 \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. Yes, that's 5 sets, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is 488, so yes, it's included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but does 480-489 also count? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 would be part of that. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, yes, 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the Digit 4:**\n1. **Units Place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens Place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the Digit 8:**\n1. **Units Place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens Place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.

So, total of 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up the fours in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488.

So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which only goes up to 488. Let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights in each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.
