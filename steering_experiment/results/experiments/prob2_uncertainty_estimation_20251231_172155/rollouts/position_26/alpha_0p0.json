    "text": " So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Hmm, but wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so all five sets are valid. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but I think I might be overcomplicating this. The hundreds place is only 4 in numbers 400-499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Wait, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Then, in the tens place, each hundred block (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 fours in the tens place, so 10 per block. There are 5 blocks where the hundreds digit is 0,1,2,3,4, but wait, actually, from 1-488, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). So, for each of these hundreds blocks except the first one (1-99), the tens place can have 4 in 10 numbers. So, for 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers), 200-299:240-249 (10), 300-399:340-349 (10), 400-488:440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40 fours in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 5 blocks, but actually, the 400-488 block is only 488, so the tens place 4's would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40 fours in the tens place. Then, in the units place, as before, 49 fours. And in the hundreds place, 89 fours. So, total fours would be 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 178 fours. Wait, that's different from my initial 188. I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me recount. Units place: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 4 + 10(n-1). Let me set 4 +10(n-1)=484. 10(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in the units place. Tens place: for each hundred block, 140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each has 10 fours, so 4 blocks, 10 each, so 40. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours:49+40+89=178. Okay, so 178 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digit can be 8 up to 488. Let's find how many numbers have 8 in the units place. The first is 8, then every 10 numbers. The last one would be 488. So, how many terms? The nth term is 8 +10(n-1)=488. 10(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, numbers where the tens digit is 8. These would be 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, let's count how many sets. Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-488, the hundreds blocks are 0 (1-99),1(100-199),2(200-299),3(300-399),4(400-488). So, in each of these blocks except the last one, the tens digit 8 occurs in 10 numbers. Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nWait, because 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, the first four blocks (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) each have 10 numbers, and the last block (480-488) has 9. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 178 fours - 98 eights = 80.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me just double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units: 49 (correct, as 4 to 484 is 49 numbers)\n- Tens: 40 (from 140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449, each 10 numbers, so 4*10=40)\n- Hundreds: 89 (400-488, which is 89 numbers)\nTotal: 49+40+89=178\n\nFor eights:\n- Units: 49 (8,18,...,488)\n- Tens: 49 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488, which is 4*10 +9=49)\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nDifference:178-98=80.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 80 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: \\( \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 4 such blocks (excluding 400-488 as it's part of the hundreds place).\n   - Total: \\( 4 \\times 10 = 40 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 49 + 40 + 89 = 178 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: \\( \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 numbers, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:** \\( 178 - 98 = 80 \\).\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 80.\n\n\\boxed{80}"

    "text": " How many such blocks are there? From 0-400, there are four blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So that's 4*10=40 fours. But wait, 440-449 is the fifth block, but 440 is 440, which is less than 488, so that's another 10 fours. So, total in tens place is 5*10=50 fours. Wait, but wait, from 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 fours. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Now, let me add up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, last is 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is the last set. So, each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one which is only 9 numbers (480-488). Let me count how many blocks: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many sets there are. Each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9). So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights, so that's 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 has 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in tens place: 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place for fours again. I thought 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contribute 10 fours. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 fours, so 50. Correct. For eights, in the tens place, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Units place for both digits: 49 each. So, fours total 188, eights total 98. Difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484) \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. \u2192 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488) \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488 \u2192 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number up to 488 \u2192 0 times.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, that's 5 blocks of 10 numbers each, so 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. Let's count how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, then every 10 numbers. The number of 8's in the units place is equal to the number of times 8 appears in the ones place up to 488. To find this, I can calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are up to 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, the 48th group ends at 480, so the next number is 481, and then 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place. Let me confirm: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th term (since 8 + (49-1)*10 = 8 + 480 = 488). So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many numbers have 8 in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 480 is the first, then 481, 482, ..., 488. So that's 9 numbers, right? Because from 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40. The last block, 480-488, contributes 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n1. **Counting the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units place:** Every 10 numbers, '4' appears once.

So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: Units:49 + Tens:50 + Hundreds:89 = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me check how many there are. The last number is 488, so the units digit is 8. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but let me check if 488 is included. Yes, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers add one. So, 8,18,...,488: that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set. So, how many sets are there? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, right? Wait, 488-480+1=9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, but let me double-check. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: Units:49 + Tens:49 + Hundreds:0 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

How many numbers is that? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, does 488 count? Yes, because the last page is 488. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but including 488, that would be 49 numbers. Let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. Yes, that's 49 times. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, let's see: Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 489 is beyond 488). So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10, and one block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, but let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so yes, 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me recount the tens place. When I was counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as contributing 9 eights. But wait, in the tens place, 480-488: the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, right? So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), each with 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, for each hundred block, except the last one, it's 10 eights in the tens place, and the last block (400-488) contributes 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Wait, but earlier, when I counted fours, I had 188 fours, and eights are 98. So, the difference would be 188 -98=90. But wait, let me double-check because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 fours, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488:89 numbers, each with 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, eights: Units place:8,18,...,488. How many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, number of terms is ((488-8)/10)+1=(480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, difference is 188 -98=90.

Yes, but the book only goes up to 488. So, let's see. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, but the hundreds digit is 4, and the units digit goes from 0 to 8. So, how many numbers here? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit is 8 for all of these, so that's 9 eights in the tens place.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Yeah, that seems right.

    "text": " So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high, but let me check again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, 400-488 is indeed 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 is correct. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be a full block, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. Let's count each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights in tens place. - 180-189: 10 eights. - 280-289: 10 eights. - 380-389: 10 eights. - 480-488: Here, 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 =9), so 9 eights in the tens place. So, total in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49, yes. So total eights: 49+49=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, it's from 400-488. So, the count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. Wait, let me check that again. 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 488 is included). So, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the fours: units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many numbers? 484 is the 49th term, as (484 -4)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours: 49 +50 +89 = 188. That seems correct. Now for the eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. How many? (488 -8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 =48 +1=49. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block. Let's count them: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.

    "text": " So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Hmm, but wait, from 40-49 is in the first hundred, then 140-149 is the second, 240-249 third, 340-349 fourth, and 440-449 fifth. So yes, 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, let me add up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 8. Wait, no, actually, 8,18,...,488: how many terms? Let me calculate: The first term is 8, and the last term is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers except the last one, which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, first set: 80-89: 10 numbers, second set:180-189:10, third:280-289:10, fourth:380-389:10, fifth:480-488:9 numbers.

Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, so that's correct.

So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.

Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, but let's check. The 8 in the units place occurs at 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence is 488. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 8,18,28,...,488. Let me calculate how many terms. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. The formula for the number of terms is ((last - first)/difference) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let me check each block. From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189: 10. From 200-299: 280-289:10. From 300-399: 380-389:10. From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, adding up: 10 (from 80-89) +10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place contributes 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

    "text": " So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of fours is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours, but wait, the last group ends at 480, so 480 + 4 = 484. So, 48 fours in the units place, right? Because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times. So, units place: 48 fours. Then, tens place: as before, 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. So total fours: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Wait, earlier I thought 48, but now I'm getting 48 +50=98, plus 89=187. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me confirm. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. So, from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. How many terms? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, 4 +10(n-1)=484 => 10(n-1)=480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 fours in the units place. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. So, which is correct? If I list them: 4 (1),14(2),24(3),...,484(49). So, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 fours. So, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Wait, but 49+50=99, plus 89=188. So, total fours:188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The last number is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, 8 +10(n-1)=488 => 10(n-1)=480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, so in the tens place, how many eights? For 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total eights in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, but let me think again. Each block like 80-89 is 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. Similarly for 180-189, etc. But 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, total eights in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, so 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89, total=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0, total=98. Difference=188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me verify the units place for fours again. From 4 to 484, stepping by 10: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place fours:49. Tens place fours:5 blocks of 10, so 50. Hundreds place fours:400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place, 8,18,...,488: same calculation, ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights=49+49=98. Thus, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block (except the last) contributes 10 eights.

But wait, let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, and 440-449 is 10. So that's 5*10=50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, I'm only interested in how many times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. So, adding up the fours from units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many such numbers are there? Starting at 8, each step of 10. The last one is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the number of terms is 49 because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 488/10=48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-489 would be 10, but we only go up to 488). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights from units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: number of 4's (188) minus number of 8's (98) equals 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake. Let me recount the fours. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The formula is (last - first)/step +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4. So, 89. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now for the eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. How many? (488-8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights=90.

So that's 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of fours is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Let me check again: 49 (units) +50 (tens)=99, plus 89 (hundreds)=188. Hmm, seems high, but let me think. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcounting. Wait, for the hundreds place, it's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. Now, for the tens place, each hundred block contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such blocks (0-499, but since the book ends at 488, the last block is 400-488, but the hundreds digit is 4 only in 400-488. Wait, but in the tens place, 40-49 is in the first hundred, 140-149 in the second, 240-249 in the third, 340-349 in the fourth, and 440-449 in the fifth. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 50 fours. That seems correct. Units place: every 10 numbers, so from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let me think differently: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing a 4 in the units place. Then, in the 49th group (481-490), but since the book ends at 488, the units place 4 appears at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 fours in the units place. So, adding up, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 times. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8. Let me count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Wait, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. And in the tens place for fours, 5 blocks of 10, so 50 fours. Units place 49 fours. So, 188 fours. For eights, units 49, tens 49. So, 98 eights. So, the difference is 90.

I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. If I divide 488 by 10, that's 48.8, so there are 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9. So total in tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total number of 8's printed is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights) =90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes 10 fours. There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), totaling 50 fours.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block contributes 10 eights. The first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) give 40 eights. The last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights. Total = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

Yes, but since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, let's count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.

From 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, and 440-449 is 10. So, 5 times 10 is 50. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, 49 units, 50 tens, 89 hundreds. So, 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, let's count each block. - 80-89: 10 numbers, but 80-89 is within 1-488, so that's 10 eights in the tens place. - 180-189: 10 numbers, that's another 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: How many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, each block contributes 10 except the last one, which contributes 9. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one block of 9 (480-488). So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place contributes 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, so total eights are 98, and total fours are 188. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counting. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let's go through the fours again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. That seems correct. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, eights: units place is 49, correct. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 5 blocks. The first four are 10 each, the last one is 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. That seems correct. For eights, hundreds place has none, so that's correct. So, the difference is 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a big number. Let me see if there's another way to count. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position separately. Let's try that. For the units digit: For any digit d (here, 4 and 8), in the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in each block of 10 numbers. So, in 488 pages, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 /10=48.8, so 48 complete blocks, and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). In each complete block, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, for 4's in units place: 48 blocks *1 per block=48, plus in the partial block (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear. So, total units place 4's:48. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 49. Hmm, so which is correct? Wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digits go up to 8 in the last partial block. So, in the units place, 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's the same as the number of times 4 is the units digit, which is floor(488/10)=48 times, plus if 488 >= 4 in the units place, which it isn't because the last units digit is 8. So, 48 times. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 49. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? Let's see: The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, that suggests 49 times. But when I think about it as 488/10=48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4 in units place, so 48, plus in the 49th block (481-490), but since we only go up to 488, does 484 fall into the 48th block or the 49th? Wait, 481-490 is the 49th block, but 484 is within 481-490, which is the 49th block. But since we only go up to 488, the units digits in this block are 1-8, so 484 is included. So, in the 49th block, 484 is the 4 in units place. So, that's 49 times. So, perhaps the correct count is 49. So, maybe my initial approach was correct. So, units place for 4's:49, for 8's: Let's see, 8,18,...,488. How many terms? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. So, number of terms is ((488-8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units place. So, that's consistent. So, units place: 4's=49, 8's=49. Now, tens place: For 4's, it's in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers, so 5 blocks *10=50 fours in tens place. For 8's, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last block contributes 9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers). So, 4*10=40 +9=49 eights in tens place. So, total eights: units 49 + tens 49=98. Fours: units 49 + tens 50 + hundreds 89=188. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but earlier when I thought about the units place for 4's, I had 49, which is correct because 484 is included. So, the difference is indeed 90. Hmm, I think that's correct. So, the final answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10, then 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, and 440-449 is 10. That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, I'm only interested in how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so yes, 89 fours. So, total number of fours is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 99 + 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again. For units place: 4,14,...,484. How many numbers? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. That's correct. For tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50. Correct. For hundreds place: 400-488: 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 is the last page, so it's included. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: (488 -8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let me count how many full sets there are. 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of eights is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 49+49=98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct.

    "text": " So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Now, let me check if that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Let me recount the units place. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 numbers: 14,24,...,484. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? It's an arithmetic sequence starting at 4, ending at 484, with a common difference of 10. The formula for the nth term is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d. So, 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 484 -4 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 480 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 fours in the units place. That's correct. Similarly, for the tens place, each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, and there are 5 hundreds (0-400, 100-199, etc.), but wait, actually, the hundreds go from 0 to 4 (since 488 is in the 400s). So, 0-99: 40-49, 10 numbers. 100-199:140-149, 10. 200-299:240-249, 10. 300-399:340-349,10. 400-488:440-449, which is 10 numbers (440-449). So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Correct. Now, the hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, then every 10 up to 488. Let's use the same method as before. The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The nth term: a_n = 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 480 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except possibly the last one if it's cut short. So, 0-99:80-89:10 numbers. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), but the tens digit is 8 in all of these, so that's 9 numbers. So, for the tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights. Wait, but let me check: 0-99:10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So total 10*4 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the hundreds place for fours: 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. Yes. For eights in the tens place, I had 49. Let me recount: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Units place for eights: 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. Correct. So, 49+49=98 eights. Fours: 188. 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The last block (480-488) has 9 occurrences, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440 is included, right? So yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place has 89 fours. Wait, but 400 is the first number where the hundreds digit is 4, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last occurrence is at 488, which is the units digit. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the book. Let me count how many sets there are. Each set of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 480-488. From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, yes, that's correct. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98.\n\nNow, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check my counting again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units: 4,14,...,484: (484-4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n- Tens: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449: Each block is 10 numbers. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each 10 numbers:5*10=50. Correct.\n- Hundreds: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct.\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor eights:\n- Units:8,18,...,488: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n- Tens:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n- Hundreds:0. Correct.\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting the hundreds place for fours, I considered 400-488 as 89 numbers. Let me verify that: 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. Correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place in eights, 480-488 is 9 numbers, correct because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So that's 5 blocks of 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks give 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I need to count how many times 8 appears in units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, for the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributes 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, the last block 480-488 contributes 9 eights (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, as 488-480+1=9). So total in tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights: 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that can't be right because I thought the answer was 90, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, let me go through the units place for fours again. From 4 to 484, every 10 numbers have a 4 in units place. So, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 full cycles, but including 484, that's 49 numbers. So units place for fours:49. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449: that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So 49+50+89=188 fours. Now for eights: units place:8,18,...,488:49 numbers. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, so 4*10=40. The last block,480-488, is 9 numbers (since 488-480+1=9). So 40+9=49. Hundreds place:0. So total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for fours. Let me check: 40-49:10,140-149:10,240-249:10,340-349:10,440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, so 5*10=50. Correct. For eights, tens place:80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct. So, yes, the difference is 90.

    "text": " So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is the fifth set, right? So, 5*10=50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, we have 49 fours in the units place. Tens place: same logic, every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 10 fours in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 sets of 100, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8, so only 40-49 would have 4 in the tens place, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is another 10. Wait, no, from 400-488, the tens digit is 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), ..., up to 8 (480-488). So, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 fours in the tens place. So total tens place fours: 4*10=40 (from 1-400) plus 10 from 440-449, totaling 50. So, that's correct. Hundreds place: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many sets of 100 have 8 in the tens place. From 1-400: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers: 480-488, but wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, from 480-488, that's 9 eights. So total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't overcount. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total: 188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total:98. Difference:188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full hundred (e.g., 1-100, 101-200) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480-488 is 9 numbers). Wait, is that right? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9. So, total tens place eights: 4 full sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4\u00d710=40, plus 9 in 480-488, so 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's okay. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: let's see, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8, so from 480-489, but the book stops at 488, so that's 9 numbers. So, for the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, 480-488 contributes 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

    "text": " So, 5 blocks each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, all 5 blocks are present. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, total number of fours is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, let me double-check that addition: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. Okay, so 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me count each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289:10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). Wait, no: from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10, and the last block contributes 9. So total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total number of eights is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98 eights. So, number of fours is 188, number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check the counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for fours and eights. For fours in the tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. For eights in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Units place for both fours and eights: 49 each. So, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights. So, the difference is 90.

    "text": " So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Wait, no, that's not correct. The hundreds digit is 4 for each number from 400 to 488, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours from units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Hmm, wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Wait, actually, when I counted the units place, I thought it was 49 fours, but let me recount. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? The last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. So, 49 fours in the units place. Then, tens place: each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so from 1-400, that's 4 sets (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349), each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit can be 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers, so total tens fours are 40+10=50. So, that's correct. Then, hundreds place: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 is the last page. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets. From 1-400, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389: that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens eights: 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

Wait, but 488 is 488, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but our book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is included. Let's count how many blocks: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last one, so 480 to 488 is 9 numbers). So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. For example, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, inclusive, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct. Now, total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Wait, but earlier I thought 49 in units and 49 in tens, so total 98. But when I added up the fours, I had 188. So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recheck the fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

So, 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the 400s, but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block which only has 9. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49 =98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98 =90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 89.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as pages go up to 488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, that's 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? Let's do (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, 480-489, but our book goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 488 is the last page). Wait, let me check: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, but actually, the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so it's 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4x10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

I'll do the same for the units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, does 488 count as the 49th? Let's check: 8,18,...,488.

Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? Let's divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, 8, 18, ..., 488. Let's check: 488 is the 49th term because 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, let me check: from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers. So, the tens place in the hundreds block of 400-488 has 9 eights, not 10. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.
