    "text": " Let me count the number of blocks: 40-49 is the first block, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 include 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 50 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of fours is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, let me double-check that addition: 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. Yeah, that seems right. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let's see: 8, 18, ..., 488. How many terms? From 0 to 488, every 10 numbers, so 488 /10 = 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many blocks: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9 = 40 +9 =49. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of eights is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me calculate how many hundreds there are. The book goes up to 488, which is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, from 1 to 488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. So, in each of these hundreds, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? For 1-100: 40-49: 10 numbers. Similarly, for 101-200: 140-149:10, 201-300:240-249:10, 301-400:340-349:10. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449:10 numbers. So that's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, the total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 +50 +89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many terms? From 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which would give 48 eights, but wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Let me check each block. From 1-100: 80-89:10 numbers. 101-200:180-189:10. 201-300:280-289:10. 301-400:380-389:10. Then, 401-488:480-488. How many numbers is that? 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 occurs in 4 blocks of 10 (each giving 10 eights) and one block of 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds =49 +49 +0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: Units place: 49, Tens place:50, Hundreds place:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For 8's: Units place:49, Tens place:49, Hundreds place:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Let me count how many hundreds blocks there are. From 1-400, we have four blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So that's 4 x 10 = 40 fours. Then, from 400-488, the next block is 440-449, which is 10 fours. So total tens place fours would be 40 + 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, so that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, contributing 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, no, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 99 + 89 is 188? Wait, 99 + 89 is actually 188? Hmm, yes, because 99 + 80 is 179, plus 9 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens place in 480-488 has 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, so 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours in total. Wait, let me check that again. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is included, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. So, how many sets of 100 have 8 in the tens place? From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but does 480-489 count? 488 is the last page, so 480-488 would be part of the tens place as 8. Wait, let me clarify: the tens digit is 8 in numbers where the tens place is 8. So, for example, 80-89: tens digit is 8, 180-189: same, 280-289, 380-389. But 480-489 would be beyond 488, so only up to 488. So, in the hundreds place, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, but the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place in the 400s? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, for the 400s, we have 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, adding that to the previous sets: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total eights in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 40, but now it's 49. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. The tens digit is 8 in the following ranges: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, but earlier I thought units place had 49, tens place 49, so total 98. Let me double-check the tens place. For the tens digit being 8, in each hundred block, except the last one, we have 10 numbers. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in the 400s, from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So total 40 +9=49. So, units place 49, tens place 49, so total eights: 49+49=98. Now, the fours were 188, and the eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, in the units place for fours, I had 49, which seems correct because from 4 to 484, that's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Similarly, for eights, units place is 49, which seems correct because from 8 to 488, that's 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. For the tens place, fours: I had 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. But wait, let me check: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours in the tens place. For eights, in the tens place, I had 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and then 9 in 480-488, totaling 49. So, that seems correct. For hundreds place, fours: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Eights: 0 in hundreds place. So, total fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188. Eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. So, 188 -98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 4 sets of 10 and 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number (since the book ends at 488).\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would mean 48 full sets, but wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. Wait, but let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. But wait, the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is included, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so only up to 488. So, how many sets of 80-89, etc., are there? Let's see: From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each hundred block (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89. So, from 1-400, there are 4 such blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 in these 9 numbers. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait, in each hundred block, the tens digit 8 occurs 10 times, but in the last block (401-488), it's only 9 times because 488 is the last page. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., but only up to 488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences for the first four blocks, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers.

So, how many sets? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Therefore, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

    "text": " Let me count how many hundreds blocks we have. From 1-400, there are four blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these has a 40-49 block. So that's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 fours in the tens place. Then, from 401-488, the next block would be 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So, total in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 fours. Wait, that seems correct because each hundred block contributes 10, and we have 5 hundred blocks up to 488. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488, so 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so the number of 8's in the units place is 49 (since 488 is the 49th occurrence). Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except possibly the last one. From 1-400, we have four blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each has a 80-89 block, so that's 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the next block is 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my counting to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 only for numbers 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, it's 400-488. So, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 49 numbers (since 488 is included as 484 is the last one ending with 4). So, units: 49. Tens place: each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4, so from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many? The last number is 488, which is 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 would have 8 in the tens place. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last one). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, that's 5 blocks, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that doesn't seem right because earlier I thought the tens place might have 49, but let me double-check. Let's list the ranges where 8 is in the tens place: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total eights: 49 + 49 = 98. Now, number of fours is 188, and number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check my counting again. For fours: units (49), tens (50), hundreds (89). 49 +50=99, +89=188. For eights: units (49), tens (49), hundreds (0). 49 +49=98. So, 188 -98=90. Hmm, so the answer would be 90 more fours than eights. But wait, I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. Hundreds place: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. That seems correct. And for the tens place, 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Units place: 49. So, 188 fours. For eights: units place is 49, tens place is 49, so 98. So, 188 -98=90.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Wait, 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Let me check that again. 49+50 is indeed 99, and 99+89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last one is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences.

But the book ends at 488, so 480-488. So, how many sets? From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in the ranges. For the tens place of 8's, I considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. Let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4*10 +9=49. Yes, that's correct. For the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488: 89 numbers, which is correct because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Units place for 4's: 4,14,...,484. Let's see, 484 is the last one. How many terms? It's an arithmetic sequence starting at 4, ending at 484, with common difference 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Similarly, for tens place of 4's: 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and how many blocks? From 40-49:1, 140-149:2, 240-249:3, 340-349:4, 440-449:5. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours in tens place. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds 0, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. There are 5 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500). But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last hundred is 401-488. So, in the 401-488 range, the tens place 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours would be 5 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 50. Wait, no, because 401-488 isn't a full hundred. Let me think again. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens place 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens fours: 40 + 10 = 50. Okay, that makes sense. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, yes, 89 numbers. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? Let's see: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, we have 480-488. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place, except possibly the last block. Let's count: From 1-400, there are four hundreds, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens place 8 occurs in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but in the tens place, the 8 is in the tens digit, so 480-488 is 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, in the last partial hundred, we have 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences, and the last partial hundred (401-488) contributes 10.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences, and the last partial hundred contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in any page number up to 488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me add them up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, I need to do the same for the digit 8. Let's go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it does. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. To find the count, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many full sets we have. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers with tens digit 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. But wait, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10, because the book ends at 488. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total eights in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, but I thought earlier it was 4 sets of 10, but actually, the last set is only 9 numbers. So, total is 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the tens place for fours again. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50. That's correct. For eights, the tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4 full sets and 1 partial set, totaling 49. Correct. Units place for fours: from 4,14,...,484. 484 is the 49th number because 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct. Units place for eights: from 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th number, so 49 eights. Correct. Hundreds place for fours: 400-488 is 89 numbers. Correct. Hundreds place for eights: none, since 800>488.

    "text": " So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book ends at 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place except the last one, which only goes up to 488, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). Let me count: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for fours. Let me recount. For the tens place of fours: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. That's correct. For eights in the tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, 188 fours and 98 eights, difference is 90.

So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's.

So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

    "text": " So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, and since the book ends at 488, that's okay. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing a 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units:49. Tens place: as before, 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49 +50 +89=188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The first is 8, last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389. Wait, 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counting. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 4's. Wait, in the tens place, for 4's, it's 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. That seems correct. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, it's 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Wait, that's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, which is 49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. So, the total 8's are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. 4's:49+50+89=188. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check another way. Alternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position. For units place: for both 4 and 8, it's the same calculation. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in units? As before, 49 times. Similarly, 8 appears 49 times in units. For tens place: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times. For hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. Total 8's:49+49+0=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For example, in the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. That's correct because 488-400+1=89. For the tens place, when counting 4's, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers, making it 5 sets of 10. For 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. So, yes, I think that's correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 40-49, that's the first block, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is only 10 numbers, but 488 is beyond 449, so that's okay. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in each of these, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, no, actually, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me check again. Units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. Total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers, just like the fours in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8 in the tens place. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 9 numbers instead of 10. So, how many blocks? Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 188 - 98 = 90 more than the number of 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because 188 - 98 is 90, but I might have made a mistake in counting the fours or eights. Let me recount the fours: units place: 49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the eights: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Hmm, but wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but the book goes up to 488, so after 449, there are more pages, but the tens digit doesn't have a 4 again until 540, which is beyond 488. So, yes, 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of fours is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last occurrence is at 488. To count how many, I can divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence, right? Because starting from 8, each 10 numbers add one more. So, 8, 18, ..., 488: that's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range. So, how many full sets of 100 do we have? From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of eights is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's correct, 49. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me check again because I might have made a mistake in counting the fours in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. Then, units place: 49, tens place:50. 89+50=139, plus 49=188. That seems correct.

So, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Hmm, wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: from 1-488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, which would give 48 fours, but then we have an extra 8 in the units place, so actually, the 49th four is at 484, which is correct. So, units place: 49. Tens place: for each hundred, 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. From 1-488, how many hundreds are there? 400-488 is the hundreds place being 4, but wait, the tens place being 4 occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.

So, total 49+50+89=188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? So, yes, 9 eights in the tens place from 480-488.

So, hundreds place: 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90.

    "text": " Let me count: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.

Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

    "text": " Let me add them up: 10 + 10 +10 +10 +10 = 50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 page numbers. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Let's count the number of 8's in each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 would be part of this. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9. So, adding them up: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9. Wait, that's 49. Wait, no, let me correct: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Checking 4's: Units place: 4,14,...,484. The formula is (488 - 4)/10 +1 = (484)/10 +1 = 48.4 +1 = 49.4, which rounds to 49, but since 484 is included, it's 49. Tens place: Each hundred has 10, so 4 hundreds (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349) is 40, plus 440-449:10, so total 50. Hundreds place: 400-488:89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: Units place:8,18,...,488: same as 4's, 49. Tens place:80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 +9=49. Hundreds place:0. So, 49+49=98. So, difference is 188-98=90.

    "text": " Let me count the number of hundreds. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So that's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 fours. Then, from 400-488, there's another block: 440-449, which is 10 fours. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but 40-49 is in 1-100, right? So, 1-100: 10, 101-200:10, 201-300:10, 301-400:10, and 401-488:10 (from 440-449). So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. Okay, so tens place gives 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours in total. Now, let me check if I did that correctly. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, seems correct. Now, moving on to counting the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many terms? If I take 488 divided by 10, that's 48.8. So, 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is included, so the units digit 8 appears 49 times? Let me confirm: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let me check how many blocks there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, is that correct? Let me see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So yes, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9 is 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, let me recap: Number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The question asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's, so I subtract 98 from 188. 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems. Let me verify the number of 4's again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many terms? (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488:89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. Now, for the 8's: Units place:8,18,...,488: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, seems correct.

That's 5 sets of 10, so 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so let's adjust. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block (400-488). Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers. Let me check that again. From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, yes, 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) plus 9 in 480-488, so 49 eights in the tens place. That seems correct. Similarly, for fours in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. So, total fours 188, eights 98, difference 90.

Then, from 400-488, the next block is 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 480-488 contributes 9 eights. So total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights: 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10=40 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting the tens place, especially for the higher numbers, I might have included numbers beyond 488. Let me check the tens place for 8's again. The tens place 8's are in 80-89, which is within 1-488, correct. Then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 488 is the last page. So, that's correct. Similarly, for fours in the tens place, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with 480-488 contributing 9. Total: 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Hmm, but wait, 440-449 is only 10 numbers, so 5 sets would be 50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Wait, no, that's not right. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but the book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers (400 to 488). So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 0, 8 is the 1st, 18 the 2nd, ..., 488 the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-489 would be 10, but we only go up to 488, so 9). So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, that's 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me add those up: 5 blocks of 10 numbers each, so 5*10=50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. Let's calculate 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but that seems high. Let me think again. The hundreds place is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but the book stops at 488, so it's 400 to 488. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 +50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does that count as an 8 in the units place? Yes, because 488 ends with an 8. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, that's 49 numbers. So, units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets do we have? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nSo, total eights in the tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, same for 180-189, etc., but 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0 eights.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I thought the tens place had 49, so total eights would be 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. But let me double-check the tens place. For example, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 in tens place.\n\nSo, total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nWait, but earlier for fours, I had 188 fours, and for eights, 98 eights. So, the difference would be 188 -98=90. But wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the fours in the hundreds place. Let me recount that.\n\nFor fours in the hundreds place: numbers from 400 to 488. So, 488 -400 +1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but when I was counting eights in the tens place, I had 480-488 as 9 numbers. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9.\n\nWait, but when I was counting fours in the hundreds place, I included 400-488, which is 89 numbers. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for fours and eights again.\n\nFor fours in the units place: from 4,14,...,484. So, how many numbers is that? Let's see: 484 is the last one. So, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 full cycles, but 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 fours in units place.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in units place: from 8,18,...,488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in units place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the eights in the tens place were 49, so total eights would be 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nSimilarly, fours in units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about the hundreds place for eights, it's zero, but for fours, it's 89. So, that's a big difference.\n\nWait, let me think again. Maybe I should verify the counts.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let's count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: For each 10 numbers, there's one 4. From 1 to 488, how many 4's in units place? The number of 4's is equal to the number of times 4 appears in the units digit. So, for each 10 numbers, once. So, 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full times, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. So, 49 fours in units.\n\n- Tens place: For each 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, in each 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, from 1-488, how many hundreds? 488 is less than 500, so it's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, 10 fours in the tens place. That's 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8, so 40-49 would have 4 in the tens place, but 401-488 includes 401-409 (tens digit 0), 410-419 (1), 420-429 (2), 430-439 (3), 440-449 (4), 450-459 (5), 460-469 (6), 470-479 (7), 480-488 (8). So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 fours in the tens place. So, total tens place fours:40+10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: As before, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\n- Units place: Similarly, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1-488, that's 488/10=48.8, so 49 times.\n\n- Tens place: In each 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place per 100 numbers. From 1-488, we have four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 eights in the tens place: 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0-8. So, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights:40+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: As before, 800-899 is beyond 488, so 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 fours -98 eights=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in tens place:40 (from the four full hundreds) +9=49.\n\nSo, total eights:49+49=98.\n\nTherefore, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because when I think about the tens place for fours, I included 440-449 as part of the 401-488 range, which adds 10 fours, making the total tens fours 50. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about another way. Maybe using a formula or a different counting method to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor a number from 1 to N, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place is given by:\n\nunits = (N // 10) + (1 if N % 10 >= d else 0)\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\ntens = (N // 100) * 10 + max(0, min(10, N % 100) - d*10 +1) if d !=0 else (N // 100)*10\n\nBut maybe that's complicating it.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of each digit position separately.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that for each digit position, the count of a particular digit can be calculated as:\n\nFor units place:\n- For each complete set of 10 numbers, the digit appears once.\n- So, total = (N // 10) + (1 if N % 10 >= d else 0)\n\nFor tens place:\n- For each complete set of 100 numbers, the digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n- So, total = (N // 100) * 10 + extra in the incomplete set.\n\nSimilarly for hundreds place.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to stick with my initial counting.\n\nWait, but let me check for 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in the hundreds place, none, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, 8's in hundreds place:0.\n\nNow, for the tens place:\n\n- For 4's: in each 100 numbers, 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 for the first 400 numbers. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 50.\n\n- For 8's: in each 100 numbers, 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 for the first 400 numbers. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 49.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- For 4's: 49 times.\n- For 8's:49 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:49+50+89=188\n\n8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 49 occurrences. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets we have. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total number of eights is units + tens: 49 + 49 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90.

How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up the number of 4's in each place: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89, plus 89 is 178. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Wait, 49 (units) + 40 (tens) = 89, and then 89 (hundreds) makes a total of 89 + 89 = 178. Hmm, that seems high. Let me think again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place.

So, how many 8's are there in the units place? The first is 8, then every 10 numbers. The last one is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 fall within 488? Yes, up to 488. So, let's count how many sets of 100 have the tens digit as 8. Each set contributes 10 numbers. From 1-400, there are 4 sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, that's 9 more. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, yes, 9 eights in the tens place. So total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up the number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that can't be right because 49+49=98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the number of 4's is 178, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 178 - 98 = 80. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units place, I had 49. Let's see: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. That's correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Wait, earlier I thought it was 4 sets, but actually, 440-449 is the fifth set. Wait, 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So that's 5 sets, each 10, so 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, tens place for 4's is 50. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 40. I think I made a mistake there. Let me correct that. So, units place:49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. So total 4's:49+50+89= 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Wait, that's different from before. Hmm, so I think I made a mistake earlier in counting the tens place for 4's. Let me recount. The tens digit is 4 in the following ranges: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, the tens place for 4's is 50, not 40. So, that changes the total number of 4's. So, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. So, 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. Now, for 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, total 8's:98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, that's different from my initial calculation. So, I think I made a mistake in the tens place for 4's earlier. Let me make sure. So, 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So, that's 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 50. So, yes, tens place for 4's is 50. Therefore, total 4's:49+50+89=188. 8's:49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but earlier I thought the difference was 80. So, I must have made a mistake in the tens place for 4's initially. Let me confirm again. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. So, 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm overcounting somewhere. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider each digit place separately and count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first is 4, then 14, 24,...,484. So, the number of terms is floor(488/10)=48, but since 484 is included, it's 49 times.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49:10 numbers, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So, 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:8,18,28,...,488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 is included, it's 49.\n\n- Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10, because 488 is the last page. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: none, as before.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 178 and 8's were 98, leading to 80. But now, after correcting the tens place for 4's, it's 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, but the last set, 480-488, is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 4*10 +9=49. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these sets has 10 numbers, and since 440-449 is within 488, that's 5 sets, so 5*10=50.\n\nSo, yes, the total 4's are 188, and 8's are 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting the units place for 4's, from 4 to 484, that's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Similarly, for 8's, from 8 to 488, same logic, 49 numbers.\n\nTens place for 4's:5 sets of 10, so 50.\n\nTens place for 8's:4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, so 49.\n\nHundreds place: only for 4's, 89.\n\nSo, 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\n8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Let me add them up: 10 + 10 +10 +10 +10 = 50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 page numbers. Therefore, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, no, 49 + 50 is 99, then 99 + 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would be the next set, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, that's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. For the 4's: Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each has 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For the 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, and the last set has 9 (480-488). So, 10*4 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. Yes. So, the hundreds place for 4's is 89. So, 188 fours, 98 eights. Difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears in numbers 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488.

Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, each block before that has 10 numbers. Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9.

How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, how many hundreds digits are 4? Each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is a three-digit number, but in the units place, it's still 8. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's see how many full blocks we have. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 4x10=40, and the last block 480-488 contributes 9. So, 40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

    "text": " Let me count how many hundreds we have. The book goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, for each hundred, there's a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-400, how many sets? Well, 400 divided by 100 is 4, so 4 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4 x 10 = 40 fours in the tens place. But wait, does the 400-488 range have any more fours in the tens place? Let's see: 400-488. The tens digit is 0 for 400-409, then 1 for 410-419, up to 8 for 480-488. So, the only set where the tens digit is 4 is 440-449, which is within 400-488. So, that's 10 more fours. So, total in the tens place: 4 sets x 10 = 40, plus 10 more in 440-449, making it 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Wait, no, because each hundred has one set of 10. So, 1-100: 40-49, 10 numbers. 101-200:140-149, 10. 201-300:240-249, 10. 301-400:340-349, 10. 401-488:440-449, 10. So, that's 5 sets, each with 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Okay, so that's 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up the hundreds, tens, and units places: Units:49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. So, units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many sets? Each hundred has a set of 10 where the tens digit is 8. So, 1-100:80-89, 10 numbers. 101-200:180-189, 10. 201-300:280-289,10. 301-400:380-389,10. 401-488:480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, in the hundreds place, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and 9 in 480-488. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0 eights. Now, adding up units, tens, and hundreds: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total eights:49 + 49 = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: Units:49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total:188. For eights: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total:98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place for fours. When counting the tens place for fours, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. That seems correct. For eights, in the tens place, I have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 4 full sets (each with 10) and one partial set with 9. So, 4 x 10 =40, plus 9=49. That seems correct. Units place for both digits: 49 each. So, 49 + 50 +89=188 fours, and 49 +49=98 eights. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 0-400, there are four blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). Then, 440-449 is another block, making it five blocks. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, let me check the last block: 440-449. The page numbers go up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within the book. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48, but wait, 488 is included, so it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check how many such blocks there are. From 0-400, there are four blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights. Now, is there another block beyond 400? 480-489 would be the next, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 in 480-488 is only from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the hundreds place. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8, so 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place. But since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for fours, I thought there were five blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each has 10 fours, so 5\u00d710=50. That's correct. For eights in the tens place, I had four full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 4\u00d710=40, and then 480-488 contributing 9 more, so 40+9=49. That seems correct. Units place for both digits: 49 each, but wait, let me check units place for fours. From 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The nth term can be expressed as 10n - 6, where n starts at 1. Wait, actually, 4 = 10\u00d71 - 6, 14=10\u00d72 -6, etc. So, the last term is 484. Let's solve for n: 10n -6 = 484 \u2192 10n=490 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 terms. That's correct. Similarly, for eights in units place, from 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 + 10\u00d748=488. So, n=49. Correct. So, units place for both digits: 49 each. Tens place: fours have 50, eights have 49. Hundreds place: fours have 89, eights have 0. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Eights: 49+49+0=98. Difference: 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly for the hundreds place? For fours, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers, correct. For eights, there's no hundreds digit 8, correct. So, yes, 89 fours in hundreds place. So, the calculation seems correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.

Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, each full block contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9 eights. So, 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) give 4*10=40 eights, and the last block (480-488) gives 9 eights.

So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. But wait, in the 400s, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's an extra 9. So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but is that correct? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This is every 10th number, starting from 4 up to 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers.\n   - Total: 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 numbers, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me count how many hundreds blocks we have. From 1-400, there are four blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each has a 40-49 block, so that's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, we have another 440-449, which is another 10. So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but wait: 40-49 is in the first 100, so that's 10. Then 140-149: another 10, so 20. 240-249: 30. 340-349: 40. 440-449: 50. So yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Wait, no, wait: the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book ends at 488, it's 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is included. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many terms? The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488. Let's solve for n: 10(n-1) = 480 => n-1 = 48 => n = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-400, there are four blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each has 10 numbers with tens digit 8: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So that's 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the tens place, we have 40 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so that's 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me count these blocks. How many blocks are there? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which would be 48 numbers, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, every 10 numbers adds one. So, 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So, let's count how many sets: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 is the first, 481, 482,...,488 is 9 numbers). So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. Wait, but let me check again. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4 times 10 is 40, plus 9 is 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Let me count the number of such blocks. From 1-400, there are four blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10 fours. So that's 4*10=40 fours. Then, from 400-488, the next block would be 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So, that's 40 + 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, units place: 49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. So, 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me think again. Wait, in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear? Every 10 numbers, so 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, but since 488 is included, the 49th occurrence is at 484. So, units place:49. Tens place: as I thought, 50. Hundreds place: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. How many terms? Let's see: (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 -480 +1=9. So, the tens digit is 8 in 9 numbers here. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, number of fours is 188, number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89, total=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0, total=98. Difference=188-98=90.

Wait, actually, each hundred block from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit is 4 in 10 numbers each. So, that's 4*10=40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is another 10. So, total tens place fours: 40 +10=50. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is (last - first)/step +1. So, (484-4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place:49. Tens place: each hundred block (0-99,100-199, etc.) has 10 numbers with tens digit 4. So, from 0-399: 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488: tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens:40+10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with 4 in hundreds place. So, 89. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because (488-8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place:49. 2. **Tens place:** 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's see: each hundred block has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8. From 0-99:80-89 (10), 100-199:180-189 (10), 200-299:280-289 (10), 300-399:380-389 (10), and 400-488:480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, units place:49, tens place: 4*10=40 from the first four blocks, plus 9 from 480-488. So, tens place:40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188-98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check the counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many times that happens. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so the last set would be 380-389, and then 480-489. But 488 is the last page, so 480-488 would be part of the tens place as 8. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, but wait, 480-488 is actually 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. Wait, no: 480 is the first, 481, 482, ..., 488. So that's 9 numbers. So, each of the first four sets (80-89, etc.) has 10 eights in the tens place, and the last set (480-488) has 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place for fours again. When I counted fours in the tens place, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 5*10=50. That seems correct. For eights in the tens place, I considered 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct. Units place for both fours and eights: up to 488, so 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers each. So, yes, units place for both is 49. So, the total fours are 188, eights are 98. Difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since 484 is the 49th occurrence).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.  \n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since 488 is the 49th occurrence).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - The first four blocks each contribute 10 occurrences, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.  \n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"
