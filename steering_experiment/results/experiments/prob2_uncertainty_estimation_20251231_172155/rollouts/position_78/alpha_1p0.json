Maybe I should check with a smaller number to see if my method works. Let's say a 20-page book. Pages 1-20. How many 1's and 2's? Let's see: 1's: units place:1,11 (2), tens place:10-19 (10), hundreds place: none. So total 1's:2+10=12. 2's: units:2,12 (2), tens:20 (1), so total 2+1=3. So, 12-3=9 more 1's than 2's. Let me count manually: 1,10-19,20. 1's:1,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19. That's 11 times, but wait, 1 appears once in 1, and in 10-19, that's 10 times, so total 11.

Wait, in 10-19, the tens digit is 1, so that's 10 numbers, each contributing one 1 in the tens place. So, 10 times. Plus units place:1,11: that's two more. So, total 12. But when I list them, I get 11. Wait, 1 appears in 1,10,11,12,...,19. Let's count: 1 (units), 10 (tens), 11 (both), 12 (tens), 13 (tens), 14,15,16,17,18,19. So, how many times does 1 appear? In 1: once. In 10-19: each has a 1 in the tens place, so 10 times. Plus, in 11, there's an extra 1 in the units place. So, total 1 (from 1) +10 (from 10-19) +1 (from 11) =12. So, my method is correct, and when I listed manually, I missed that 11 has two 1's, so it's 12. So, in the 20-page book, 1's:12, 2's:3, difference 9. So, my method works.

And for the tens place, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's correct. Maybe I should check a smaller example to see if my method works. Let's say a book with 20 pages. How many 4's and 8's? Page numbers 1-20. 4's: 4,14 \u2192 2 times. 8's:8,18 \u21922 times. So, 2-2=0. Wait, but according to my method: Units place: 4 and 14 \u21922.

Another example: 50 pages. 4's: units:4,14,24,34,44 \u21925. Tens:40-49 \u219210. So total 15. 8's: units:8,18,28,38,48 \u21925. Tens:40-49 doesn't have 8 in tens, but 80-89 isn't in 1-50, so 0.

The count is:\n   \\[\n   488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n   \\]\n   So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n\\[\n49 (\\text{units}) + 50 (\\text{tens}) + 89 (\\text{hundreds}) = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). The sequence starts at 8 and ends at 488. The number of terms is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n   So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last block which ends at 488, contributing 9 eights. Therefore, the count is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ blocks} \\times 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49\n   \\]\n   So, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book only goes up to 488. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n\\[\n49 (\\text{units}) + 49 (\\text{tens}) + 0 (\\text{hundreds}) = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference:**\n\\[\n188 (\\text{number of 4's}) - 98 (\\text{number of 8's}) = 90\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."
