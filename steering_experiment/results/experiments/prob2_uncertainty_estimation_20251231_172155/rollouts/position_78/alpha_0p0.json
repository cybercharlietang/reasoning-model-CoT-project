There are 49 such numbers (from 4 to 484 inclusive).\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit):** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit):** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Number of '8's:**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** The digit '8' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit):** The digit '8' appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges each contribute 10 numbers, and the last range contributes 9 numbers (since the book ends at 488), totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit):** The digit '8' does not appear in the hundreds place as the book only goes up to page 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe digit '4' is printed 90 times more than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
