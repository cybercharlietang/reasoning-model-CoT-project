    "text": " So, 488 is included, and that's part of the hundreds place. So, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - This sequence has 49 terms (from 0 to 484, every 10 numbers).  \n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   - Each set contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such sets.  \n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 400-488.  \n   - This range includes 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).  \n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - This sequence has 49 terms (from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers).  \n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.  \n   - The first four sets contribute 10 eights each, and the last set (480-488) contributes 9 eights.  \n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).  \n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"
