    "text": " 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is 488, so it's the 49th 8 in the units place. So, units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set. Let's see how many sets there are. Each block of 100 has one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yep, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? The first is 8, then every 10 numbers. So, 8,18,...,488. The total number is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 0, 8 is the 1st, 18 the 2nd, ..., 488 the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is within 488, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. So, how many sets do we have? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. So that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, total eights are 89. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 89 = 99. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 40. 49+40=89. So, 188-89=99. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. The hundreds place for fours is from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so that's correct. And for eights, since the hundreds place doesn't go beyond 488, there are no eights there. So, yeah, 188 fours and 89 eights, so the difference is 99. So, the answer should be 99 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 4 such blocks.\n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **89**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = **99**.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **99**.\n\n\\boxed{99}"

Let's see how many sets of 100 we have. Each set contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Wait, let me make sure. Units:49, tens:49. So, 49+49=98. Yes, that's correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in the tens place. For the fours in the tens place: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, and 440-449 is 10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. That seems right. For the eights in the tens place: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. That seems correct.

For fours: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For eights: hundreds place is 800-899, which isn't present, so 0. Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th number because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. That's correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 +9=49. So, units and tens each have 49 eights, totaling 98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers. Let me just quickly check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

    "text": " 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, last is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. The number of terms can be calculated as ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be another set, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So, let's count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last. So, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems correct. Let me just cross-verify. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights. I think that's the answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, but let me just make sure I didn't double-count or miss any numbers. For units place fours: 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers. Tens place fours: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, 5 blocks, so 50. Hundreds place fours: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units 8,18,...,488: 49. Tens place:80-89,180-189,...,480-488: 49. So, 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

Correct. Tens place for eights: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389. That's 4 sets, 40 eights. Correct. Hundreds place for fours: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.

    "text": " 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see: the first is 8, then 18, 28,..., up to 488. To find how many, we can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. Wait, 488 is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because starting from 0, it's every 10 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is the last set. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 =9). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, let me confirm: units 49, tens 49, so 49+49=98. That seems correct. So, the total number of fours is 188, and the total number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed. Wait, did I do that right? Let me double-check the counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yes, that seems correct. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many that is. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but the last group has 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is okay, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. So, let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights. So, 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the book, so does that add any more? In the tens place, 480-488 has 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, that's an extra 9 eights in the tens place. Wait, but when I counted earlier, I thought each block of 100 has 10 eights in the tens place, but in the last block (400-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, in the hundreds place, 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, how many 8's? Let me recast this: For the tens digit, each hundred block (e.g., 0-99, 100-199, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. But in the last block (400-488), the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many complete hundreds blocks do we have? From 1-99: 10 eights in tens place (80-89). From 100-199: 10 eights (180-189). From 200-299: 10 eights (280-289). From 300-399:10 eights (380-389). From 400-488:9 eights (480-488). So, total eights in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, that's different from my initial thought. Let me check again. Wait, no, because from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens place has 10 (from 80-89) +10 (180-189)+10 (280-289)+10 (380-389)+9 (480-488)=49 eights. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 40, but that's not correct because I didn't account for the last partial block. So, tens place has 49 eights. Wait, no, that can't be right because 400-488 is only part of the 400-499 block, but the book ends at 488. So, in the tens place, the 8's are in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, 10, 10, 10, and 9 eights. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, but let me double-check. Units place: 49 eights, tens place:49 eights, so total 98 eights. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but earlier I thought the tens place for 8's was 49, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the tens place. Let me recount the tens place for 8's. From 1-99: 80-89:10 eights. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 in the tens place. Units place: same as 4's, 49. So, total 8's:49+49=98. 4's:188. Difference:188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences (from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each complete block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - The last block (400-488) contributes 9 occurrences (480-488).\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = **49** occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, 90 more 4's than 8's. Let me just double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yep, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does that count? Let me list some: 8,18,28,...,488. That's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, right? Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, because 488-480=8, but including both endpoints, it's 9. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, etc.) each have 10 eights in the tens place, and the last block (480-488) has 9. So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.

So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me make sure. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. Yes, that seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms in this sequence is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49.

So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, that's 49? Let me add: 10+10=20, +10=30, +10=40, +9=49. Yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49+49=98. Hmm, but let me make sure. Units place:49, tens:49, so total 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems like a lot, but let me check again.\n\nWait, did I make a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place? Because from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for that range. So, adding up: 10 (80-89) +10 (180-189)+10 (280-289)+10 (380-389)+9 (480-488) = 49 eights in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't overcount in the hundreds place for fours. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, correct. Because 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, for units place fours: from 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers, as 484 is 484, which is the 49th term.\n\nWait, but when I count units place fours, I included 484, which is correct. So, 49 units, 50 tens, 89 hundreds, total 188 fours.\n\nEights: units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct.

So, from 0 to 488, how many 8's in units place? It's floor(488/10) + 1 if the last number is included. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. Then, since 488 is included, it's 49.

Let me recount. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4*10 +9=49.

That's five sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50.\n\nBut for eights, in the tens place, the last set is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers, so that's why it's 49 instead of 50.

Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers, since 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, let me count each block: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits that are 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Wait, let me check that again. Units place: 49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. That's correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** The digit '4' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, the book goes up to 488, so the last set is 380-389. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, so that's 4 sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389). So, 4 x 10 = 40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but does 480-489 exist? Since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of the hundreds place. So, in the tens place, 8 can only go up to 389, which is 4 sets. So, 40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (40) = 89. Wait, that seems off. Let me recount. Units place: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me calculate how many terms there are. The first term is 8 (1st term), the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place:49. Tens place: as above, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, so 40 eights. So, total eights:49 + 40 = 89. So, total eights:89. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's.

    "text": " 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, starting at 8, the last one is 488. How many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8*49=392? Wait, no, 8*50=400, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see: 488 is the 49th number because 8*49=392, but 488 is 8*61=488, which is more than 49. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating. Alternatively, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is the number of complete decades up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? Let me calculate: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 is included. So, how many sets of 100 have 8 in the tens place? From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, total eights in the tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9=49. Wait, is that right? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me double-check. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. Yep. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but wait, did I make a mistake in counting? Let me verify the counts again. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. That seems correct.

Each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so that's 4*10=40. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 =9).

Hmm, wait, let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: from 4,14,...484. That's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers. So 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: same as fours, 49. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 4 full blocks (each 10) and one partial block with 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place:0. So, 49+49=98. Then, 188-98=90.
