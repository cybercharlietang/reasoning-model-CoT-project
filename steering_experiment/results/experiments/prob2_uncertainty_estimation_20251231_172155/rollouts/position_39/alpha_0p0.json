    "text": " 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see, the last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? Starting from 8, each step of 10. The number of terms can be calculated as ((488 - 8)/10) + 1. Let's compute that: (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except possibly the last block. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yep, that looks correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This is 49 occurrences (40 in the first four blocks and 9 in the last).\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set. So, how many sets? From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, each of the next three sets is 10, and the last set is from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.

Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but the last group includes 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would be next, but since the book ends at 488, we have 480-488. So, how many sets? Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block, which only goes up to 488, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check the counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the tens place for fours. Let me check: tens place for fours is 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's five sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. For eights in the tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's five sets, but the last set has 9 numbers instead of 10. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9: 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, the difference is indeed 90.

So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, no. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's the same as the number of times 8 appears in each block of 10. So, from 1-488, there are 488 numbers. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full decades and a partial one. Each full decade contributes one 8 in the units place, so 48 times.

Hmm, but wait, when I counted the tens place for 4's, I considered 440-449, which is correct because 440-449 is within 488. But for eights, in the tens place, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (including both 480 and 488). So, 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers.

Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block from 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. Similarly, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, the first four sets (80-89, etc.) have 10 each, and the last set has 9. So, that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

    "text": " 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,..., up to 488. The last number is 488, so how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be another set, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49+49=98. Hmm, so the number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Let me just quickly verify my counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. Difference is 90. That seems correct. I think I did everything right, but just to be thorough, let me check the counts again. Units place for fours: from 4,14,...484. How many? (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place for fours: each hundred block has 10, and there are 5 blocks (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but for the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place for fours: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place. Correct. For eights: units place is 8,18,...488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, since 800+ is beyond 488. So, 0. Correct. So, 188 fours and 98 eights, difference is 90.

So, let's count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, that's 480-488 inclusive, which is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Wait, that seems a bit low. Let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens:49, so 98 total. Hmm, that seems correct because in the tens place, we have 49, and units place 49, so 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block. Let's count them: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9.

Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when counting the tens place for fours, I considered 440-449 as part of the tens place. But in the hundreds place, 440-449 is already counted in the hundreds place as 4. So, that's correct because each position is independent. Similarly, in the tens place for eights, 480-488 is 9 numbers, which is correct because 488 is the last page. So, I think my calculation is correct.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the tens place, in the hundreds, like 140-149, that's 10 numbers, same for 240-249, etc., up to 440-449.

Similarly, for the tens place, in the 480-488 range, the numbers are 480,481,...,488. The tens digit is 8 in all these numbers, so that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive).

So, tens place:49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, let me check: units is 49, tens is 49, so 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.

The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8*61=488? Wait, no. Wait, 8 appears once every 10 numbers, so from 8 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's (488 - 8)/10 + 1. Wait, that's (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Each of these sets has 10 numbers except the last one, which has 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, how many sets? From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I feel like maybe I made a mistake in counting the tens place for fours or eights. Let me check the tens place for fours again. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50. That's correct. For eights in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last block only has 9 numbers, so 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct. So, the difference is indeed 188-98=90.

So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and 9 from 480-488. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.

    "text": " 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does that count as an 8 in the units place? Yes, it does. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9 (480,481,...,488). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that seems off because earlier, I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, but let me recount. 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488: that's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, 9 eights in the tens place for 480-488. So, total in tens place is 49. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Wait, but when I thought about units place, I thought 488 is included, so units place has 49 eights. Let me confirm: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, units place:49. Tens place:49. So, total eights: 98. Now, the number of fours was 188, and the number of eights was 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours. Let me recount the fours. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. That's from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place:49. Tens place:40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, tens place:50. Hundreds place:400-488:89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place. So, 89. Total fours:49+50+89=188. That's correct. Now, eights: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So, 98 eights. So, 188 - 98 =90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly? Because sometimes when counting, it's easy to make an off-by-one error. Let me check the units place for fours: 4,14,24,...,484. That's 49 numbers, correct. Tens place:40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, 10 each, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place:400-488:89 numbers. Correct. So, 188 fours. For eights: units place:8,18,...,488:49 numbers. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

The formula is ((488 - 8)/10) +1. So, (480/10) +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), right? So, each block from 80-89, 180-189, etc., has 10 numbers, except the last one which is cut off at 488. So, let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9.

So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For the units place of 4's: from 4,14,...484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. That's correct. For tens place of 4's: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks (from 0-400, so 400/100=4, but wait, 440-449 is the fifth block). So, 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For the 8's: units place: 8,18,...488. Number of terms: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10, the last has 9, so 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, 49+49=98 eights. 188-98=90. Yep, that seems right.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n\nWait, let me just go through that again to make sure I didn't miss anything. For the fours: units place had 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, totaling 188. For the eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, totaling 98. 188-98=90. That seems correct. I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for eights. Let me check again. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and then 480-488:9 numbers. So that's 4*10=40 plus 9=49. So, 49 in tens place. Units place is 49, so total eights are 49+49=98. Yes, that's correct. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).

    "text": " 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. To find the count, I can do (488 - 8)/10 + 1. So, (480)/10 + 1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block, which only goes up to 488. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, which is 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights here. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is included, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. So, how many sets of 100 have the tens digit as 8? From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Wait, but 380-389 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 89. So, there are 89 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 89 eights = 99. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 40, hundreds 0. 49+40=89. So, 188 - 89 = 99. Hmm, that's correct. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. And in the tens place for fours, I had 5 sets (40-49, 140-149, etc.) each giving 10 fours, so 5*10=50. Units place fours: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 4,14,24,...484. How many? Let's see, 484 is the last one. So, from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 fours in units place. That's correct. For eights, units place: 8,18,...488. 488 is 488, so (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place for eights: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389. Each set has 10 numbers, so 4 sets *10=40. Correct. So, the total eights are 49+40=89. So, fours are 188, eights 89. The difference is 188-89=99. So, there are 99 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, how many sets are there? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers), 100-199:180-189 (10), 200-299:280-289 (10), 300-399:380-389 (10), and 400-488:480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, for the tens place, each hundred has 10 eights, except the last one which has 9. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for eights. Let me recount the tens place for eights. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10*4 +9=49. That's correct. So, the difference is indeed 90.
