    "text": " 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 is beyond 488, so we only go up to 488. So, how many full sets do we have? From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 40 eights in the tens place. But wait, 480-488 is part of the book. The tens digit here is 8, and the numbers are 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9 more in 480-488, making it 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Let me just check my counting again to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. That seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences (from 4 to 484 inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488. This range includes 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1), each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences (from 8 to 488 inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges each contribute 10 numbers, and 480-488 contributes 9 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n\nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, correct. So, 89 fours there. Now, for the tens place in fours, I had 50, which is 10 per hundred, and there are 5 hundreds (0-9, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, no, actually, in the tens place, the 4 appears in each hundred block once. So, 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. That's correct. Now, for eights, in the tens place, we had 49, which is 10+10+10+10+9. Wait, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9=49. That's correct. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems a large number. Let me think if I counted correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use a formula to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position.\n\nFor a digit d in a position (units, tens, hundreds), the count can be calculated as follows:\n\n- For units place: total numbers = floor(n/10) + 1 if the units digit is >= d.\nWait, maybe a better approach is to use the formula for digit counting.\n\nLet me try to formalize it.\n\nFor a given digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated by:\n\n- Let the current position be the k-th digit (k=1 for units, k=2 for tens, etc.).\n- The higher part is the number formed by digits higher than k.\n- The current digit is the digit at position k.\n- The lower part is the number formed by digits lower than k.\n\nThe formula is:\n\ncount = higher * 10^(k-1) + \n        if current > d: 10^(k-1)\n        elif current == d: lower + 1\n        else: 0\n\nBut maybe it's easier to apply this formula to each digit position.\n\nLet me try this for fours and eights.\n\nFirst, counting the number of fours:\n\n1. Units place (k=1):\n   - n = 488\n   - higher = 488 // 10 = 48\n   - current = 488 % 10 = 8\n   - lower = 0\n   - Since current > 4, count += (higher + 1) * 1 = (48 +1) *1=49\n\n2. Tens place (k=2):\n   - higher = 488 // 100 =4\n   - current = (488 //10) %10=8\n   - lower = 488 %10=8\n   - Since current >4, count += (higher) *10=4*10=40\n   - But wait, the formula is higher * 10^(k-1) + ... So, higher is 4, current is 8, which is >4, so count += 4*10 +10=50? Wait, maybe I'm mixing up.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the standard digit counting method.\n\nFor units digit (k=1):\n\n- The number of times 4 appears in units place is floor(488/10) + 1 if 488 mod 10 >=4. Since 488 mod10=8 >=4, so floor(488/10)=48, so 48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units place.\n\nFor tens digit (k=2):\n\n- The number of times 4 appears in tens place is calculated by:\n   - higher = 488 // 100 =4\n   - current = (488 //10) %10=8\n   - lower = 488 %10=8\n   - if current >4, count += (higher +1)*10\n   - else if current ==4, count += higher*10 + lower +1\n   - else, count += higher*10\n   - Since current=8>4, count += (4+1)*10=50\n   - So, 50 fours in tens place.\n\nFor hundreds digit (k=3):\n\n- higher =488 //1000=0\n- current=(488//100)%10=4\n- lower=488%100=88\n- since current=4, count += higher*100 + lower +1=0*100 +88 +1=89\n- So, 89 fours in hundreds place.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188, which matches my earlier count.\n\nNow, for eights:\n\n1. Units place (k=1):\n\n- higher=488//10=48\n- current=488%10=8\n- since current >=8, count += higher +1=48+1=49\n\n2. Tens place (k=2):\n\n- higher=488//100=4\n- current=(488//10)%10=8\n- lower=488%10=8\n- since current=8>=8, count += (higher +1)*10= (4+1)*10=50\n- But wait, does this include all cases? Wait, actually, when current digit is 8, the count is higher*10 + lower +1.\n\nWait, let me apply the formula correctly.\n\nFor tens place (k=2):\n\n- higher=4\n- current=8\n- lower=8\n- since current=8, count += higher*10 + lower +1=4*10 +8 +1=40+8+1=49\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 49, but using this formula, it's 49. Wait, but earlier I had 49 for tens place eights. Wait, but when I counted manually, I had 10+10+10+10+9=49, which matches.\n\n3. Hundreds place (k=3):\n\n- higher=0\n- current=(488//100)%10=4\n- lower=488%100=88\n- since current=4 <8, count +=0\n- So, 0 eights in hundreds place.\n\nSo, total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe 90 seems high, but using the formula, it's consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place for eights. Because in the tens place, when current=8, the formula gives higher*10 + lower +1=4*10 +8 +1=49, which is correct because from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9, which totals 49. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference between their counts.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit from the right):**\n     - The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n     - Number of 4s: 48 (from 4 to 480) + 1 (484) = 49.\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit from the right):**\n     - The digit 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n     - Number of blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n     - Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit from the right):**\n     - The digit 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n     - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - **Total 4s:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n     - Number of 8s: 48 (from 8 to 480) + 1 (488) = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - The digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n     - Number of blocks: 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 40, and 480-488 contributing 9.\n     - Total 8s: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n     - Total 8s: 0.\n   - **Total 8s:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4s: 188\n   - Number of 8s: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:**\nThere are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, that's 4 full sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4\u00d710=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, total of 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 4\u00d710 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, but let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, so total 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each step again. For the 4's: units place from 4,14,...,484: that's (484-4)/10 +1 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449: 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Hundreds place:400-488: 89 numbers. So 49+50+89=188. For the 8's: units place:8,18,...,488: (488-8)/10 +1=48.8, so 49. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488: 4 full sets (each 10) and 9 in the last set, totaling 49. Hundreds place:0. So, 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Wait, but 480-489 would be another set, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except possibly the last block. From 1-400: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 40 eights. Now, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 more eights in the tens place. So total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That's correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Wait, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, that's correct. For the tens place, fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. Correct. Units place for fours: every 10 numbers, so 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10=484. So, (484-4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. For eights: units place, 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1=49. Correct. Tens place for eights: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four contributes 10 eights, and the last one contributes 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct. So, the difference is indeed 188-98=90. Wait, but I feel like maybe I missed something. Let me check the hundreds place for fours again.

Hmm, but wait, let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. That seems correct. And for the tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 in tens place. Units place, 49. So, 188 fours. For eights, units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90.

From 40-49, 140-149, etc. Up to 440-449. How many hundreds? From 0-400, so 4 sets (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then 400-488: 440-449 is another 10, so total 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct. Total 49+50+89=188.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\n- Units place: From 8,18,...,488. So, 488 is included. So, (488 - 8)/10=48, plus 1 is 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49.

So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me make sure. Units:49, tens:49, so 98. Yep. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed. Wait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 4, 14, 24, ..., 484, there are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in numbers 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 8, 18, 28, ..., 488, there are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 40 occurrences, and 9 more in 480-488, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8's appear every 10 numbers. So, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so the count should be 49. Let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. That's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except for the last block, which is only up to 488. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last one, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). Wait, is that correct? Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 40 +9=49. Wait, no, wait: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So that's 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me double-check. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. That seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights) =90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188. For eights, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, total 98. 188-98=90. That seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many are there? The last occurrence is 488, which is the units digit. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let me calculate how many numbers have 8 in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers with tens digit 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check the counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place for fours. Wait, when I counted the tens place for fours, I considered 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. That seems right. Similarly, for eights in the tens place, we have 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's five blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. So, that's correct. And for hundreds place, fours are from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, and eights in hundreds place are zero. So, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights, so 90 more fours.

Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for eights. Let me recount that. In the tens place, 8 appears in 80-89, which is 10 numbers, then 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9.
