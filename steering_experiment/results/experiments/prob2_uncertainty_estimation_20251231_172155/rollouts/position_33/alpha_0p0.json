    "text": " Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does that mean the units place 8's go up to 488? Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 fall within the book? The book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, how many sets of 10 are there where the tens digit is 8? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, as 488 - 480 +1 =9). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 10 (from 80-89) +10 (180-189) +10 (280-289) +10 (380-389) +9 (480-488) = 10+10=20, +10=30, +10=40, +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99+89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488-400+1=89. So, that's correct. And for the tens place in fours, I had 50, which comes from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. That seems correct. For eights, in the tens place, I had 49 because the last set was 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. So, yes, 49. Units place for eights:49, same as fours. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The last block is 480-488, which has 9 numbers. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let's check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? The formula is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would be next, but the book only goes up to 488. So, let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. Let me verify: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Yes, that's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many tens places have an 8. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80s, 180s, 280s, 380s) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place had 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, totaling 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, totaling 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me check the units place for fours: from 4 to 484, that's every 10 numbers, so (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct. Tens place for fours: from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. For eights: units place, 8 to 488, every 10 numbers. 488 -8 = 480, 480/10 = 48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9 = 49. Correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Let me count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189:10 - 280-289:10 - 380-389:10 - 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last one, so 480 to 488 is 9 numbers) So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8.

Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units (49), tens (50), hundreds (89) = 188. For eights: units (49), tens (49), hundreds (0) = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for fours. Let me check that again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For eights, in the tens place, I had 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, 480 is included, so 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9. So, 49 in tens place. So, 49 eights in units, 49 in tens, total 98. Fours: 49 units, 50 tens, 89 hundreds, total 188. So, 188 - 98 = 90.

So, that's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block from 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers (from 0 to 484 inclusive), so 49 fours.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such blocks, totaling 50 fours.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, contributing 89 fours.\n\n**Total fours:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers, contributing 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 eights each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights, totaling 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total eights:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights.\n\n**Difference:** 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, seems right. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers, so 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. But wait, does 480-489 exist? Since the book goes up to 488, yes, 480-488 are included. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-400: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 40 eights. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 is 90. But let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me check the units place for 4 again. From 4,14,...,484. So, how many terms? The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The nth term is 10n - 6, but perhaps it's easier to compute (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So that's correct. For the tens place, 40-49,140-149, etc., each 10 numbers per block. There are 5 blocks: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). So 5*10=50. Plus the hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place, 8,18,...,488. That's (488-8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. Total tens place eights:40+9=49. Units place eights:49, tens:49, so total eights:98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. Yes, that's correct. For eights, hundreds place: none, since the book ends at 488, which is less than 800. So, yes, 0 eights there. So, the total fours are 188, eights are 98, so 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48, but including 488, it's 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me check up to 488. 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but 488 is the last page. So, how many sets do we have? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers?

So total tens place eights: 10 (80-89) +10 (180-189)+10 (280-289)+10 (380-389) +9 (480-488) = 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8.

So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake. Let me recount the fours: Units place: from 4,14,...,484. So, how many? 484 /10 =48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488:89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. That's correct. Now, eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488: 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I feel like that's a lot. Let me check if I counted correctly for the hundreds place in fours. From 400 to 488 inclusive: 488 - 400 +1 = 89. Yes, that's correct.

Let's see how many times that happens. The last number is 488, so dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, which means 48 full sets, but the 49th number is 488. So, units place has 49 eights. Wait, but let me count: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, how many numbers? The formula is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49.

    "text": " Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first is 8 (which is 8*1), the next is 18 (8*2), and so on. So, 488 is 8*61, which would be the 61st occurrence? Wait, that doesn't make sense because 488 is 488, so the units digit is 8. Let me think differently. Each block of 10 numbers has exactly one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8. That's 48 eights. But wait, does the last partial block (481-488) have an 8? Yes, 488 is included, so that's one more 8, making it 49 eights in the units place. Wait, but when I count 8,18,...,488, how many terms are there? The nth term is 8 + 10(n-1). So, 8 + 10(n-1) \u2264 488. So, 10(n-1) \u2264 480, so n-1 \u2264 48, so n \u2264 49. So, there are 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 489 is beyond 488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, yes, 4*10=40 and +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights here. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the units place for fours again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then 14, 24,...,484. Let me see: 484 is the last one. So, how many terms? The nth term is 4 + 10(n-1) = 484. So, 10(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in units place, correct. For tens place, fours: 40-49, 140-149,...,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and how many blocks? From 40-49 (1 block), 140-149 (another), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. For eights: units place, 8,18,...,488. As above, 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,...,480-488. Each block of 100 contributes 10, except the last one which contributes 9, so 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: 49 (since 484 = 4 + 10*(49-1)).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, totaling 5 blocks * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 89 (488 - 400 + 1).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: 49 (since 488 = 8 + 10*(49-1)).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 eights, except the last which contributes 9, totaling 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

To find how many, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within 488. 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 set, but only up to 488. Each block from 80-89, 180-189, etc., has 10 numbers. Let's count how many full blocks there are. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check that again. Each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 1-488, how many hundreds have a tens digit of 8? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 (since 489 is beyond 488)\n\nSo that's 10*4 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the tens place. Each hundred block (like 0-99, 100-199, etc.) has exactly 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, how many hundreds are there? From 0-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488: since 480-489 is part of this, but 488 is the limit, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, that's 4 full hundreds (each contributing 10) and one partial with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, that's correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier for fours, I had 188 fours. So, the number of fours is 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours and eights.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units: 4,14,...,484. That's from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each has 10, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488: 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. (488-8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four has 10, the last has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: 0, since 800+ is beyond 488. So, 0.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nThus, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed any page numbers. For example, in the hundreds place for fours, 400-488: that's correct, 89 numbers. For eights, the tens place up to 488 is correct. I think the calculations are accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Each of the first four sets (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, but the last set (480-488) has 9 numbers because 489 is beyond 488.

Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. Similarly, for eights in the tens place, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks each have 10 eights, and the last block has 9 eights, so 4*10 +9=49.

    "text": " Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. Again, I'll check each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which suggests 49 numbers, but let me confirm. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th term (since 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488 \u2192 10*(n-1)=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many full sets we have. Each set from 80-89, 180-189, etc., has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484.

Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours and eights in each place. For fours: Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units:49. Tens place: Each hundred block has 10, and there are 4 blocks (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, 5 blocks. So, tens:50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct. For eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. That's ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units:49. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Let's count each: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens:49. Hundreds: none, so 0. Total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90.

So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. Let's see how many numbers that is. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part gives 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48 full tens, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it starts at 8 (1st), 18 (2nd), ..., 488 (49th). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each set from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 gives 10 eights in the tens place, and 480-488 gives 9 eights (since 488 is included). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.
