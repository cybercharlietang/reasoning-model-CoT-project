    "text": " Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be the next set, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488. So, let's see: each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), we find that there are 188 fours and 98 eights. Subtracting these gives 90 more fours than eights.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 count? Yes, because it's page 488. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480-488). So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last block which only goes up to 488. So, how many such blocks? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total:98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place for 8 again. I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9. So, 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one block of 9 (480-488), so 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That's correct. Similarly, for fours in the hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place for fours: 4,14,...,484. Let me check how many that is. The last 4 in the units place before 488 is 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 fours in units. Tens place for fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That adds up to 49+50+89=188. For eights, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, total 98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, starting at 8, the next is 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within the book. Since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. So, each hundred block has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, the first four blocks give 4*10=40, and the last block gives 9, so total 40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check the tens place for 8. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 49, so total eights are 49 +49=98. Wait, but earlier for fours, I had 188 fours. So, the difference would be 188 -98=90. But wait, let me check again because I might have made a mistake. Let me recount the eights in the tens place. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Units place: 49, so total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89. Then, tens place: 50, units:49. 89+50=139, plus 49=188. That's correct. For eights, units:49, tens:49, so 98. So, the difference is 188-98=90.

Each block (e.g., 0-99, 100-199, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check that again. From 80-89: 10 eights in the tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Then, 480-488: that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total eights in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. When I considered 480-488, that's 9 numbers, right? So, 480, 481, ..., 488: that's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, yes, 4 full sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one set of 9, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89 (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = **49**.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

That's 5 sets, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. 49+50+89=188, that seems right. For eights: units place: 49, which is correct because from 8 to 488, step 10: (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9.

Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, so actually, the last 8 in the units place is at 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me double-check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Let's see how many there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but including 488, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? But the book ends at 488, so 480-488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can only be 8 if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. When I considered 480-488, that's 9 numbers, right? So, 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188 and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours. Let me recount the fours. Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 484 /10 =48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. For eights, units:49, tens:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for eights. When I counted 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. That's correct. So, yes, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, so 98 eights. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90 more fours.

    "text": " Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Let's go through each place again. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within the book's page count. Since the book has 488 pages, 480-488 is included. So, how many sets of 100 have the tens digit as 8? From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9.

So, there are no hundreds places with 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, fours are 188, eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that can't be right because when I added up fours, I got 188, and eights 98, so 188-98=90. But let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake in counting. Let me go through the fours again: units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds place: none. So, 49+49=98. So, 188 fours and 98 eights.

Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take the integer part, which is 48, but let's check if 488 is included. Yes, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, from 8 to 488 in steps of 10, that's 49 numbers (since 488 is the 49th occurrence). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set. Let's count how many sets there are. Each hundred has one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers, right? Wait, no, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, the first four sets (80-89, etc.) have 10 each, and the last set has 9. So total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188 and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the units place. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one 8. So, from 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? The total number is floor(488 / 10) + 1 if 488 mod 10 is 8 or higher. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188.

For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place for fours again. I had 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Correct. For eights, in the tens place, I had 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct. Units place for eights: 488 is included, so 49 eights. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Let me see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups of 10, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, it's included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 fall within the book? The book ends at 488, so 480-488 is included. So, each of these blocks has 10 numbers except maybe the last one. Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

    "text": " Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's do the same for 8's. Again, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so it's actually 49 numbers. Let me check: starting at 8, each 10 numbers adds another 8 in the units place. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive). So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights, so that's 4*10=40. The last set, 480-488, has 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups, but 488 is the 49th occurrence.

Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place.

So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I overcounted the hundreds place for fours. Let me check: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right. For eights, in the tens place, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, total 98 eights. So, yes, the difference is 90.

    "text": " Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488 with a step of 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count each block. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 488 is included). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4*10=40. Then, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 40+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. I think I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for fours. Wait, when I counted the tens place for fours, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Let me count how many sets that is. From 40-49:1 set, 140-149:2nd set, 240-249:3rd, 340-349:4th, 440-449:5th. So, 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. That's correct. Similarly, for eights, the tens place had 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, etc.) and one partial set (480-488), which is 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct. So, the difference is 188-98=90.

    "text": " Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is included because it's the last page. So, starting from 8, every 10 numbers up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. To find the count, I can do (488 - 8)/10 + 1. So, (480)/10 = 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is included, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so only up to 488. So, how many sets do we have? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Each of these is 10 numbers, so that's 4 sets, which is 40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488: the tens digit is 8 here as well. From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, we have 40 + 9 = 49 eights? Wait, no. Let me correct that. The tens digit being 8 occurs in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 40, but now I'm getting 49. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10*4 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights here. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought units was 49 and tens was 49, making 98. But wait, let me check again. Units place: 8,18,...,488. How many? From 8 to 488, step 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units. Tens place: as above, 49 eights. So total eights: 49+49=98. Now, the number of fours was 188, and eights were 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but that seems high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I feel like that's a lot. Let me check again. Maybe I overcounted the hundreds place for fours. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right. For the tens place, 4 in the tens digit: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, step 10. So, (484-4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for eights. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. So, yes, 98 eights. So, the difference is 90. But wait, let me think again. When counting the tens place for eights, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, that's correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90. Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the tens place for fours. Let me check: 4 in the tens place occurs in 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. So, correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. So, 49+50+89=188. So, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights. So, the difference is 90. So, the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Number of occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each block (except the last) contributes 10 occurrences, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Number of occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

Yes, because the last page is 488. So, how many such numbers are there? Let's see: The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but including 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it.

So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, subtracting the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but I feel like I might have made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Wait, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. But wait, 400 is included, so 488-400+1=89. That's correct. For eights in the tens place, I had 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, so 98 eights. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the tens and units places, I might have miscounted. Let me cross-verify. Alternatively, another approach is to count the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nAnother way to calculate the number of times a digit appears in a particular position is to use a formula. For example, in the units place, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to N is given by:\n\n- For units place: floor((N + 1) / 10) * 1 + (if (N % 10) >= d, then 1 else 0). But I think that might complicate things more. Alternatively, for each position, we can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recount the fours and eights more carefully.\n\nStarting with fours:\n\n- Units place: Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. From 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48*1=48. But wait, the last partial set is from 481 to 488, which includes 484, so that's one more 4. So total units place fours: 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: For the tens digit, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many such blocks are there? From 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488. Wait, but 401-488 is not a full block of 100. Let's see: how many times does the tens digit 4 occur? In each full hundred, it's 10 times. How many full hundreds are there? 400-488 is part of the 400s, but let's see:\n\nFrom 1-488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, for the tens digit:\n\n- 0-99: tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49: 10 times.\n- 100-199: 140-149: 10.\n- 200-299: 240-249:10.\n- 300-399:340-349:10.\n- 400-488: 440-449:10, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's another 10. So total tens place fours: 5 blocks of 10, so 5*10=50. That's correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nNow for eights:\n\n- Units place: Similarly, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. From 1-488, how many 8s in units place? 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. The last partial set is 481-488, which includes 488, so that's one more 8. So total units place eights: 48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: For the tens digit 8, it occurs in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count:\n\n- 80-89:10 numbers.\n- 180-189:10.\n- 280-289:10.\n- 380-389:10.\n- 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can't be 8. So 0 eights here.\n\nTotal eights: 49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (4, 14, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens Place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total Fours:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (8, 18, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens Place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488 (9 numbers). Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total Eights:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 fall within 488? Yes, up to 488. So, each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480 is the first, 481, 482, ..., 488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks give 4*10=40, and the last block gives 9. So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 is 90, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. Let me double-check. When counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks gives 10 eights, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so that's 9 eights. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. That seems correct. So, the total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. And fours are 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. And for the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, so 50. Units place is 49. So, 50 + 49 + 89 = 188. For 8's, units and tens give 49 each, so 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).

    "text": " Now, I need to count the number of 8's in the same way. Let's do that. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number would be 488. So, how many such numbers? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last one). Wait, let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers.

Since the book only has 488 pages, 480-488 would be the numbers with tens digit 8. Let me count how many sets: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9.

For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the tens place for eights again. When counting 480-488, that's 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49. So, yes, that's correct. Similarly, for fours in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89.
