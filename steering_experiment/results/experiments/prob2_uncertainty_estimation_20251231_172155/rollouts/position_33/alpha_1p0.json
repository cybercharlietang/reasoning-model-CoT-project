    "text": " Wait, let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yes, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so integer part is 48, but including 488, it's 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, how many sets? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last one). So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Wait, but earlier I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, right? 488-480=8, so 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 eights in the tens place for 480-488. So, 49 eights in the tens place. So total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks up to 440-449.\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488) which has 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, let me double-check that. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many 4s in units? The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1 = floor(484/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So that's correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10, and there are 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, 400-488 is part of the fifth hundred block. So, in each complete hundred block (like 0-99, 100-199, etc.), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 0-488, how many complete hundreds are there? 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So that's 5 blocks, but the last block (400-488) isn't a complete hundred. So, in each complete hundred, there are 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4 complete hundreds (0-399) would give 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409 and 440-449, but wait, 400-409 is 10 numbers, and 440-449 is another 10. So that's 20 fours in the tens place from 400-488. So total tens fours would be 40 + 20 = 60? Wait, that contradicts my earlier count. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that in each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9, so every hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-399, that's 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40 fours in the tens place. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409 (10 numbers) and 440-449 (another 10). So that's 20 fours. So total tens fours would be 40 + 20 = 60. So, earlier I thought it was 50, but now I'm getting 60. That's a discrepancy. Let me check with specific examples. From 40-49: 10 fours. From 140-149:10. 240-249:10. 340-349:10. 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 fours, so 50. But according to the other method, from 0-399, it's 4*10=40, then 400-488 adds 20, making 60. Wait, but 400-488 includes 400-409 and 440-449, which are two sets of 10, so 20. So, total would be 40 (from 0-399) + 20 (from 400-488) = 60. But when I count each set from 40-49, etc., I only get 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Where is the confusion here? Oh, I think I see. The 400-488 includes two more sets: 400-409 and 440-449, which are within 400-488. So, in 0-399, there are 4 sets: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, each in their respective hundreds. That's 4 sets, each with 10, so 40. Then, in 400-488, we have 400-409 (10) and 440-449 (10), so 20. So, total is 40 + 20 = 60. So, I think the correct count for tens place is 60 fours. So, earlier I thought 50, but now I'm seeing 60. That changes things. So, units place:49, tens:60, hundreds:89. So total fours:49+60=109, plus 89 is 198. Wait, that's different from my initial 188. Hmm, I must have miscalculated earlier. Let me try another approach. Alternatively, maybe I should use a formula to count the number of times a digit appears in each position.\n\nFor a given digit d and position p (units, tens, hundreds), the count can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. **Units place:** For each complete group of 10 numbers, the digit appears once. So, total units fours = floor(488 / 10) = 48, but since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, we add 1, so 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** For each complete group of 100 numbers, the digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, total tens fours = (488 // 100) * 10 = 4*10=40. Then, we look at the remaining 88 numbers (400-488). In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 400-409 (10 numbers) and 440-449 (10 numbers), so 20. So, total tens fours = 40 + 20 = 60.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 +1 =89).\n\nSo, total fours:49+60+89=198.\n\nWait, that seems consistent now. So, 198 fours.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach.\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers:8,18,28,...,488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, and the last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place:49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 count? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, in the tens place, 8 appears in 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, since 480-488 is 9 numbers:480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights:4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) and 9 in 480-488. So, 4*10=40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but let me check with the formula. For tens place:\n\nTotal tens eights = (488 // 100)*10 + min( (488 % 100) -8*10 +1, 10 )\n\nWait, maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, as before:\n\nFrom 0-399, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8:80-89, 180-189, etc. So, 4 hundreds (0-399) would have 4*10=40.\n\nThen, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, total tens eights:40 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. So, hundreds place eights:0.\n\nSo, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 0-399: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's 4 sets, each with 10, so 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units eights were 49, same as fours. So, fours are 198, eights are 98. So, the difference is 198 -98=100.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I did the eights correctly. Let me check the units place again. Units eights:8,18,28,...,488. How many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, the number of terms is floor((488 -8)/10)+1 = floor(480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, that's correct.\n\nTens place eights: as above, 49.\n\nSo, total eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, fours:198, eights:98. Difference:198-98=100.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 100. But I'm not sure if I did the fours correctly. Let me recount the fours.\n\nFours:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:60\n\nHundreds:89\n\nTotal:49+60=109+89=198.\n\nEights:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:49\n\nHundreds:0\n\nTotal:98.\n\nDifference:198-98=100.\n\nSo, the answer should be 100 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - From 0-399: 4 sets of 10, totaling 40.\n   - From 400-488: 400-409 and 440-449, totaling 20.\n   - Total: 60.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 60 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 198.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - From 0-399: 4 sets of 10, totaling 40.\n   - From 400-488: 480-488, totaling 9.\n   - Total: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place (since pages go up to 488).\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n198 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 100.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{100}"

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8, but how many numbers is that? From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, I think that's correct. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for eights. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. And units place: 8,18,...,488. Since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 units, 49 tens, 0 hundreds: 98 eights. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is indeed 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many times this happens. The first 8 is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would give 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, 8,18,...,488.

So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through the counts again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check if I counted correctly in each place. For units place fours: 4,14,...,484. 484 is 4*121=484, so from 4 to 484, how many numbers? It's (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place fours: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place fours: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (since (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49).\n   \n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   \n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - This range has 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms.\n   \n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40, and 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   \n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Let me double-check that. Wait, when I counted the units place, I thought 484 is the 49th occurrence. Let me see: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 fours, plus one more for 484, making it 49. That seems right. Similarly, for the tens place, each hundred has 10 fours, and there are 5 hundreds (0-400, but wait, actually, the hundreds place is 0 for 1-99, 1 for 100-199, etc., up to 4 for 400-488). So, for each hundred, except the first, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, 100-199: 10 fours, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:10. Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 within that range. So, that's 10 numbers. So, 10 fours in the tens place for each hundred except maybe the last one? Wait, no, because 400-488 includes 440-449, which is a full set of 10. So, that's 5 sets (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-449, and 450-488). Wait, no, 400-449 is a set where the tens digit is 4, and 450-488 doesn't have the tens digit as 4. So, actually, the tens digit 4 appears in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-449. That's four sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 40 fours in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 50. Hmm, I'm confused now. Let me recount. The tens digit is 4 in the ranges:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers (but this is in the first hundred, 1-100)\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249:10\n- 340-349:10\n- 440-449:10\n\nSo that's 5 sets, each with 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. Okay, so that's 50. So, the hundreds place is 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. So, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that is. The last occurrence is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights, plus one more for 488, making it 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the range, so how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nWait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 480 is the first, then 481, ..., up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? Because 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for the last set.\n\nSo, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. For each hundred:\n\n- 1-100: 80-89: 10 eights\n- 101-200:180-189:10\n- 201-300:280-289:10\n- 301-400:380-389:10\n- 401-488:480-488:9\n\nSo, that's 10 + 10 +10 +10 +9=49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place had 49 eights, and the tens place had 49, so total 98 eights.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights, plus one more for 488, making it 49. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place had 49, tens place had 49, so 98 total.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought about the tens place, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, so 9 eights, making the tens place total 49. So, yes, that adds up.\n\nSo, total eights: 98.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's take a smaller example to check. Suppose we have a book with 100 pages. How many eights would there be? Units place: 8,18,28,...,98: 10 eights. Tens place: 80-89:10 eights. So, total 20 eights. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in our case, up to 488, units place has 49, tens place has 49, so 98 eights.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. So, that seems correct.\n\nSo, total eights: 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place had 49, tens place had 49, so 98. But when I calculated fours, I had 188. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the fours count. Units place: 49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct.\n\nEights: units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. That seems right.\n\nWait, another way to check: total number of digits. Let's see, from 1-9: 9 numbers, each single digit: 9 digits. 10-99: 90 numbers, each two digits: 180 digits. 100-488: 389 numbers, each three digits: 1167 digits. Total digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits.\n\nWait, but the total number of digits should also be equal to the sum of all digits in page numbers. Alternatively, maybe I can cross-validate the counts of 4's and 8's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nFor counting the number of times a digit appears in each position, we can use the method where we consider each digit place separately and calculate how many times the digit appears.\n\nLet me try that for both 4's and 8's.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n\nWe can calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488.\n\nThe formula is: for each complete group of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, the number of complete groups is floor(488 / 10) = 48. Each group contributes 1 occurrence, so 48. Then, we check the remainder: 488 % 10 = 8. So, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once more (at 484). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n\nHere, 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like x4y, where x can be 0-4 (since we go up to 488), and y can be 0-9, but we have to consider the upper limit.\n\nFor each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n\nNumber of hundreds: 488 is in the 400-488 range, so we have 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n\nIn each of the first four hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit 4 appears exactly 10 times. So, 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\nIn the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 more.\n\nTotal tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n\nHere, 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n\nSimilarly, for units place, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. Number of complete groups: floor(488 / 10) = 48. Remainder: 8. So, in the last group (481-488), 8 appears at 488, so one more occurrence. Total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n\n8 appears in the tens place in numbers like x8y. Each hundred has 10 such numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nNumber of hundreds: 5 (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n\nIn each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\nIn the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 9 occurrences.\n\nTotal tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n\nAs before, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Calculating the difference:**\n\nNumber of 4's: 188\n\nNumber of 8's: 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nSo, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of '4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** '4' appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** '4' appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** '4' appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal '4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of '8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** '8' appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** '8' appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** '8' does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal '8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

The last number is 488, which is the 49th multiple of 10 after 8. So, 8,18,...,488: that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus the 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Units place, every 10 numbers, so 484 is the last one, which is 49 times. Okay, moving on to counting the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, looking at units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. Let's see how many that is. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 0, 8 is the first, 18 the second, ..., 488 the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Wait, how many numbers is that? Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me double-check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

Tens place: each hundred has 10, and there are 4 full hundreds (1-400), but wait, 400-499 would be another, but since we stop at 488, does that affect the count? Wait, no, because for the tens place, each hundred block from 1-100, 101-200, etc., up to 400-499, each contributes 10 fours in the tens place. But since we only go up to 488, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit can still be 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The last number is 488, which is the 49th term because (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, how many sets? From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, so total eights are 98. But wait, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total eights:98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10. The number of terms is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of terms} = \\left(\\frac{484 - 4}{10}\\right) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n   So, 49 fours in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such ranges:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 10 = 50\n   \\]\n   So, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place in the range 400-488.

The first four ranges contribute 10 eights each, and the last range contributes 9 eights:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\n   \\]\n   So, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total eights:**\n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 49 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 0 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference:**\n\\[\n188 \\, (\\text{fours}) - 98 \\, (\\text{eights}) = 90\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** There are \\boxed{90} more 4's printed than 8's."

Tens: Each hundred block has 10, and there are 4 full blocks (1-400), but wait, 400 is the start of the hundreds place. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. From 1-99, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 100-199: 140-149: 10. 200-299: 240-249: 10. 300-399: 340-349:10. 400-488: 440-449:10, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10.

Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, each hundred block contributes 10, except the last one which contributes 9.

So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

That's four sets, each with 10 eights in the tens place, so 40. Units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers.

Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does that mean 488 is included? Yes, so units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of this. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks are there up to 488. From 1-400: 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, that's 9 more eights in the tens place. So total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, but earlier I thought units place had 49 eights, tens place 49, so 98 total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems. Let me recount the fours. Units place: from 4,14,...484. How many? Let's see, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 full tens, but since 484 is included, that's 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...488. 488 is the 49th number. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.

The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. Wait, does 488 count as the 49th? Let me see: 8,18,28,...,488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th term (since 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10 => n= (488-8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except possibly the last block if it's cut short. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So that's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 =49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that right? Let me think again. Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so for 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 in 480-488. So that's 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number \u2192 0 times.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me check if I missed anything. Wait, when counting the hundreds place, I considered 400-488, which is correct because the book has 488 pages. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Let me count how many full sets of 100 we have. Each set contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each with 10, so 40 eights. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, in the tens place, we have 40 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, but earlier I thought 480-489 would be another 10, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9. So, 40 from the first four sets and 9 from the last partial set, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights. Wait, but earlier when I was counting the tens place for 8's, I thought there were 49 eights, but let me verify that. From 80-89: 10 eights in the tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but earlier I thought I had 188 fours and 98 eights, so the difference is 90. But let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counts. Let me recount the fours: Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these has 10 numbers, so 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89), each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in hundreds place. Total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. Now, for eights: Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 eights, so 4*10=40. The last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, 40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Hundreds place: No eights, as before. So, total eights:49 +49=98. Therefore, the difference is 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, let me double-check that. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in units. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, which would mean 49 fours in the units place, correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in tens, so 4 sets (from 0-499, but our book only goes up to 488, so in the hundreds place, we have 400-488, which is 89 numbers, but for the tens place, I think we can still have 10 in each hundred up to 400, 500, etc., but since 488 is less than 500, the tens place in 400-488 would still have 10 fours in 440-449, but wait, from 400-488, the tens digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So that's 4 sets (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only part of the 400-499 range, but since the book ends at 488, does that affect the count? In 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10. So total tens place fours: 4 (from 100-399) *10 +10 (from 400-488) = 50. So that's correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. So total fours: 49 +50 +89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is 8 in units. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the book. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except maybe the last one if the book ends before the next set. So, from 0-99: 80-89:10 numbers. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488: how many numbers? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but the book stops at 488, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 (from 0-399) and then 9 in the 400-488 range. So total tens place eights: 4*10 +9 =40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights:0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. Wait, but let me double-check the counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check the tens place for fours again. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Correct. For eights in tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Units place: both 4 and 8 have 49 each, because 488 is included. So, units place is correct. Hundreds place: fours have 89, eights have 0. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** '4' appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each hundred has 10 such numbers, and there are 5 hundreds (0-499), but only up to 488. Thus, 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a '4'. So, 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to '4', '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each hundred has 10, but in 400-488, it's only 480-488, which is 9. So, 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No '8's since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 times more than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Alternatively, for each digit position, count the number of 4's. Let's see: For units place, as before, 49. For tens place, 50. For hundreds place, 89. So, total 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many 8's in the units place? Let's see, starting at 8, each 10 numbers. The last one would be 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? Let's compute 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, it's included. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me count again. Each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 4 hundreds (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10, and the last one contributes 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's.

    "text": " Let me check that again. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yeah, that seems right. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, so let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. Since 488 is the 49th occurrence (8, 18, ..., 488). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 times.\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit):** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10, totaling 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit):** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 times.\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit):** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The last set has 9 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit):** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit within 1-488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Okay, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place separately. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers are there? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would be another set, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that's 98 eights. Wait, but let me check the tens place again. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10 +9=49, yes. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, number of fours is 188, number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each block contributing 10 occurrences.\n   - Total occurrences: 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., each block contributing 10 occurrences.\n   - The last block (480-488) contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total occurrences: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me check if I missed anything. Wait, in the hundreds place, I considered 400-488 as 89 numbers, but wait, 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 = 88, but adding 1 gives 89. That seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll go through each digit position again. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many sets. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9. So, yes, 9. So total in tens place is 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.

    "text": " Now, let me check if I did that right. Wait, in the units place, I thought 484 is the last one, which would be 484. So, 484 is the 49th number because 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 49 numbers. Yes, that seems correct. And in the tens place, each hundred has 10, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but for the tens place, when considering 40-49, 140-149, etc., each of these is within their respective hundreds. So, 5 sets of 10, which is 50. That seems correct. And the hundreds place is 89. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, then 18, ..., 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block, which is 480-488. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. That seems correct. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for fours. Let me check again. When counting the tens place for fours, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50. That's correct. For eights, in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49. That's correct. So, I think my counts are accurate.

Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, does 480-488 count as a full set? Let's see: 480-489 would be a full set, but the book ends at 488, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each full set from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 gives 10 numbers each, and the last set from 480-488 gives 9 numbers. So, how many sets? 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place.

The last one is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence.

Yes, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but earlier I thought each block contributes 10, so from 1-400, 4 blocks, 4*10=40. Then 480-488 is 9 more, so total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Then 480-488: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. So, tens place eights: 49. Units place: 49. So total eights: 49 + 49 = 98. Okay, so total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours. Let me recount the fours. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? 484 is the 49th number because 484 = 4 + 10*(n-1), so n = (484 -4)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 fours in units. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours. Eights: units 49, tens 49, total 98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units place:** '4' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** '4' appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** '4' appears in the hundreds place for all pages from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of '8's:**\n   - **Units place:** '8' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** '8' appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each (40 total), and 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is '8' since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yeah, that seems right. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many numbers is that? The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers with 8 in units place? Let's see: The last number is 488, which is 8 more than 480. So, 480 +8=488. So, how many steps of 10? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full steps, but the first number is 8, which is the 0th step? Wait, maybe a better way is to think of it as numbers from 0 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place. So, 0-488 is 489 numbers. But since we start at 1, it's 488 numbers. The number of times 8 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) +1 if the last number is >=8. Wait, 488/10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. But since 488 is included, we add 1 more. So, 48 +1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, does 480-488 include 488, which is the last page. So, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers. So, the first four sets (80-89, etc.) each have 10, and the last set has 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. For the tens digit being 8, we have 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). That's 4*10 +9=49. So, yes, 49 in tens place, plus 49 in units, so 98 total eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours. Let me recount the fours. Units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place:89 fours. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many that is. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40 and 9, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me make sure. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9.

So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188.

Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, 5 sets, but the last set has only 9 numbers, so 4 full sets and 1 partial set. So, 4*10 +9=49. That's correct.\n\nSo, total eights: 49+49=98.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought of 49 in units and 49 in tens, so 98 eights.\n\nNow, comparing to fours: 188 fours and 98 eights.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the fours in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for fours, I had 5 sets of 10: 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 5 sets, each with 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: 49 fours, as we have 4,14,...,484, which is 49 numbers.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188 fours.\n\nEights: units 49, tens 49, so 98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check again for the units place of fours. From 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place of eights: from 8 to 488, (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So that's correct.\n\nTens place for fours: 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 50.\n\nTens place for eights: 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers, so 49.\n\nWait, no, earlier I thought of 5 sets but only 4 full sets and 1 partial. Wait, let me recount.\n\nFor eights in the tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 5 sets, but the last set has only 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, total eights: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90 more fours.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed any numbers. For example, in the hundreds place, fours go up to 488, which is correct. For eights, there are none in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but wait, 488 is included in the units place for eights, right? So, 488 is counted as a units place eight, which it is. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, 488 is 4 in the hundreds, 8 in the tens, and 8 in the units. So, each digit is counted separately. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when counting fours in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers. Each of those has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, the fours are in 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours.\n\nUnits place fours: 4,14,...,484, which is 49 numbers.\n\nSo, 89+50+49=188 fours.\n\nEights: units place is 49, tens place is 49, so 98 eights.\n\nThus, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can write a small program or use another method to verify. Alternatively, I can think of it as the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFor 4's: The number of times 4 appears in units place is floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10)=48, but wait, that formula might not be accurate. Wait, actually, for each digit position, the count can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's = number of complete groups of 10, which is 488//10=48, and then if the remainder is >=4, add 1. 488%10=8, which is >=4, so 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: 488//10=48, and 488%10=8, which is >=8, so 48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's: The number of complete groups of 100 is 488//100=4. Each group contributes 10 numbers where tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49). So, 4*10=40. Then, look at the remaining part: 488%100=88. The tens digit in the remaining part is 88//10=8, which is greater than 4, so we add 10 (from 440-449). So total 40+10=50.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: Similarly, number of complete groups of 100 is 4, each contributing 10 numbers where tens digit is 8 (80-89, etc.), so 4*10=40. Then, the remaining part is 88, which is >=80, so we have 80-88, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4's: The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, 488-400+1=89 numbers.\n\nFor 8's: The hundreds digit is 8 would be from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\nFours:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50+89=188\n\nEights:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** From 4, 14, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** From 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Count the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** From 8, 18, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** From 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** None, as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, that seems right.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. So, units place has 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 count? Yes, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, for the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 (80s, 180s, 280s, 380s) and one set of 9 (480s). So, that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, so 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98 eights.\n\nBut wait, in the tens place, I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 480-488: 480,481,...,488. Let me count: 480 is the first, then 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, so yes, 9 eights in the tens place for the 480s. So, 4 sets of 10 (80s,180s,280s,380s) which is 40, plus 9 makes 49 in the tens place. So, total eights:49+49=98.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I thought about the hundreds place for 4's, I included 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so that's correct. But for 8's, the hundreds place doesn't contribute anything because the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, total eights:98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place for 8's is 49, and tens is 49, so 98 total.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nLet me recount the number of 4's:\n\n- Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? The formula is floor((488 -4)/10) +1. So, (484)/10=48.4, floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 fours in units.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in tens.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488:488-400+1=89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal:49+50+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\n- Units place:8,18,...,488. How many? The last number is 488, which is 8*61=488. Wait, 8*61=488? Let me check: 8*60=480, plus 8 is 488. So, the units digit 8 occurs every 10 numbers, starting at 8, so the count is floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 is included, it's 49. So, 49 eights in units.\n\n- Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in tens.\n\n- Hundreds place: none, as before.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I remember sometimes when counting digits, especially in higher places, you have to consider overlaps or something, but I think in this case, since we're counting each digit separately, it's okay.\n\nWait another thought: when counting the tens place for 4's, 440-449 is included, but does 440-449 have 4 in both tens and hundreds? Yes, but each digit is counted separately, so that's fine.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, 480-488 has 8 in the tens place and 4 in the hundreds, but each digit is counted separately.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, the number of 8's is 98, so 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check the units place for 8's again. The last number is 488, which is 488. So, the units digit is 8, which is included. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, how many numbers? The formula is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in units, it's the same: from 4 to 484, which is 484-4=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, you might miss some cases, but I think I've covered all the possibilities.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we'll count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of 4's: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences, so 5 blocks contribute 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Number of 4's: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of 8's: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 40, and 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would give 49 numbers.

So, that's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9.

Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. For the tens digit 8, each block of 100 has 10 numbers, except the last block which goes up to 488. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10 +9 = 49, which matches. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. So, now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 -98 =90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.

In the tens place, each hundred has 10, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit for 400-488 is 4, which is 89 numbers. So, the tens place 4s are in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Okay, that's correct. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The last 8 in the units place is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Each of these sets (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers. How many such sets are there? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, so the last set only has 9 numbers because 489 is beyond 488. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89 up to 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, subtracting the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights. Wait, but let me double-check the counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units (49), tens (50), hundreds (89). 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units (49), tens (49), hundreds (0). 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{484}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).  \n   Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   5 \\times 10 = 50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n   \\]\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 50 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 89 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).  \n   The first four blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contribute 10 occurrences.  \n   The last block (400-488) contributes 9 occurrences (480-488).  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   0\n   \\]\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 49 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 0 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**  \n\\[\n188 - 98 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

Wait, 480-489 would be next, but since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488.

So, that's 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, no: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9.

    "text": " Let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would suggest 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also count? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that range. So, let's see: each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). Wait, is that right? 480, 481, ..., 488: that's 9 numbers, but actually, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9. So, in the hundreds place, the 480-488 is part of the 400s, so the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Units place: 49, tens:49, so total eights are 98.\n\nWait, but earlier for fours, I had 188, and for eights, 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for eights. So, in the tens place, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but in the units place, I had 49 eights as well, so 49 + 49 = 98. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place for eights. The last page is 488, so the units digit 8 occurs at 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms is that? The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The nth term can be expressed as 8 + 10(n-1) = 10n - 2. We set 10n - 2 \u2264 488. So, 10n \u2264 490, so n \u2264 49. So, n=49, which means 49 terms. So, units place eights:49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for fours in the units place: 4,14,...,484. Let's check that. The nth term is 4 + 10(n-1) = 10n -6. Setting 10n -6 \u2264488, so 10n \u2264494, so n \u226449.4. So, n=49, so 49 fours in units place. Correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought for fours, units place was 49, which is correct.\n\nNow, for the tens place of fours: 40-49,140-149, etc. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 50 fours. Correct.\n\nAnd in the hundreds place, fours are from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a four in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So, total fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor eights, units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0. So, total eights:98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. For example, in the hundreds place, when counting fours, I included 400-488, which is correct because those are three-digit numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. For eights, since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place, so that's correct.\n\nAnother way to check is to consider that for each digit position, the count should be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position.\n\nFor a given digit d and position p (units, tens, hundreds), the count can be calculated as:\n\ncount = higher * 10^p + current * (current >= d ? 1 : 0) + lower + 1 if current > d.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use a standard digit counting method.\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating it. Since I've already broken it down manually and got 188 fours and 98 eights, the difference is 90. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).

I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,..., up to 488. Let's see, the last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book stops at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights.

Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me double-check the counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188.

    "text": " Wait, let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yes, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that's 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, 8, 18, 28,..., 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? The last number is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 / 10 = 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 380-389. Let's count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 x 10 = 40 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, there are 89 eights in total. Wait, but let me check again. Units:49, tens:40, hundreds:0. So, 49+40=89. That seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 89. The difference is 188 - 89 = 99. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That's correct. For eights: units:49, tens:40, hundreds:0. 49+40=89. So, 188-89=99. Hmm, but wait, let me think again about the tens place for fours. From 40-49, that's 10 numbers, correct. Then 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 5x10=50. Correct. For the hundreds place, 400-488: that's 89 numbers, correct. For eights: units:49, correct because 8 appears once every 10 numbers, and 488 is included. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each is 10 numbers, so 4 sets, 40 eights. Correct. So, 188 fours and 89 eights. 188-89=99. So, the answer is 99 more fours than eights. But wait, let me think again. When counting the units place for fours, I considered 4,14,...,484, which is 49 numbers. Similarly, for eights, units place is 8,18,...,488, which is also 49 numbers. So, units place for both digits contributes 49 each. Then, tens place for fours is 50, for eights it's 40. Hundreds place for fours is 89, for eights it's 0. So, yes, 49+50+89=188, and 49+40+0=89. So, the difference is indeed 99. Therefore, there are 99 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in any hundreds place within 1-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 89.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 99.\n\n$\\boxed{99}$"

    "text": " Let me check that again to make sure I didn't miss anything. Units: 4,14,...,484: that's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens: each hundred block has 10, and there are 5 blocks (40-49,140-149, etc.), so 50. Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers. 49+50+89=188. Yeah, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that's 49 numbers (8,18,...,488). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me make sure. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " Wait, let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many numbers is that? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. So, each of these blocks has 10 numbers except maybe the last one. Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Wait, but earlier I thought the hundreds place for 8's would be zero, which seems correct. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, let me just check if I missed anything. For the fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188. For the eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. 188 - 98 = 90. That seems correct. But let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. And for the tens place, 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Units place: 49. So, 89+50+49=188. For eights, units: 49, tens:49, so 98. So, the difference is 90.
