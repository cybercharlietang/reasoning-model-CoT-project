    "text": " Let me see. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Well, the first number is 4, then every 10th number after that. So, the sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find how many terms there are, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence. The nth term is given by a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_1 is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms. Here, a_1 = 4, d = 10, and a_n = 484. Plugging in: 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 484 - 4 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 480 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's look at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place as in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? Well, from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, how many full decades are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Each of the first four decades (0-99, 100-199, etc.) has a range where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers each. So, that's 4 ranges \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, adding that, total 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is part of the 400-488 range, so that's included. So, total 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10. 200-299: 240-249 \u219210. 300-399: 340-349 \u219210. 400-488: 440-449 \u219210. So that's 5 ranges \u00d710=50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 only for numbers 400-499, but since our book ends at 488, it's 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 188 4's. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let me see how many terms there are. The first term is 8, last term is 488. The common difference is 10. So, using the same formula: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)*d \u2192 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 488 -8 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 480 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, so let's see. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers except maybe the last one. Let's count: From 0-99: 80-89 \u219210 numbers. 100-199:180-189\u219210. 200-299:280-289\u219210. 300-399:380-389\u219210. 400-488:480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 -480 +1=9. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total for tens place: 4 full decades \u00d710=40, plus 9 in the last partial decade. So, 40+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 98 8's. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, giving 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., but only 480-488 in the hundreds place, giving 9 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let's see, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place would be the total number of complete groups of 10. That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but let me think again. If I take 488 divided by 10, it's 48 with a remainder of 8. So, the last complete group is 480-488, where the units digit goes up to 8, so 484 is included. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: from 1-99, there's one range (40-49). From 100-199, another (140-149). From 200-299, another (240-249). From 300-399, another (340-349). From 400-488, another (440-449). So that's five ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many times. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups. But wait, 488 is included, so 488 is the last one. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. How many such ranges are there? From 1-99: 80-89 (1 range). From 100-199: 180-189 (1). From 200-299: 280-289 (1). From 300-399: 380-389 (1). From 400-488: 480-489, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges with 10 each, and one with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above, but the book only goes up to 488. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, 97 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 187 fours minus 97 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For 8's: units 48, tens 49, hundreds 0. 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 8's. Let me check that again. From 1-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189 is 10. 200-299: 280-289 is 10. 300-399: 380-389 is 10. 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4*10 + 9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. So, 48 units + 49 tens = 97. So, 187-97=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

    "text": " Let me calculate. The first 4 in the units place is at 4, and the last one before 488 would be 484. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? It's an arithmetic sequence where the first term is 4, the last term is 484, and the common difference is 10. The formula for the number of terms is ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many times this happens. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. Similarly, 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. Now, 440-449: that's another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, 5 sets of 10, which is 5*10=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488? Let's see, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, the last 8 in the units place is 488. Let me calculate how many terms there are. The first term is 8, the last term is 488, common difference is 10. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let me count how many sets there are. 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me think. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place is equal to how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488. That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 48 times 10 is 480, so the last group would be 481-490, but our book stops at 488, so we have 488 - 480 = 8 numbers left. But since 488 is the last page, the units digit 4 would appear in 484, which is within 480-488. So, from 481-488, 484 is the only one with a units digit of 4. So, actually, the total number of 4's in the units place would be 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 (from 481-488), totaling 49. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me check again. From 1-488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is how many times 4 is the units digit. So, every 10 numbers, it appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then in the last partial group (481-488), 484 has a units digit of 4, so that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10), but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, let's add up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, but let's check. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and in the last partial group (481-488), 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So, units place 8's: 48 +1=49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. The ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last range. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Now, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, how many 8's in the tens place here? Each number from 480-488 has 8 in the tens place, right? Because 480 is 4 8 0, 481 is 4 8 1, up to 488 which is 4 8 8. So, that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 (from the first four ranges) +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49+49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's, so 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (48 full groups of 10 plus one in 484).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in pages 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (48 full groups plus one in 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times (40 from the first four ranges plus 9 in 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let's see, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 48 times 10 is 480, so the last page is 488, which is beyond 480. So, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, the 4 appears once every 10 numbers, and since 488 is the last page, the 48th cycle ends at 480, and the 49th cycle starts at 481. But in the 49th cycle, the units digit 4 would be at 484, which is within 488. So, actually, the number of 4's in the units place is 49. Wait, no, that can't be right because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, we have 48 full cycles plus an extra 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each cycle of 10, there's one 4 in the units place. So, 48 cycles give 48 4's, and then in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more at 484. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for a block of 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, let's see how many such blocks are there up to 488. The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 blocks would contribute 5*10=50 4's. But wait, the last block is 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so from 400 to 488 is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to the 4's, but let's see. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 8's. But then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block. Each full block (like 80-89) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's count the blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five blocks. The first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, contributing 4*10=40 8's. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. Total: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 49, Hundreds place: 0. Total: 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full cycles of 10 within 480, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - The remaining pages (481-488) include one more 4 at 484.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place for blocks like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - This range includes 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers contribute one 8 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full cycles, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - The remaining pages (481-488) include one more 8 at 488.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 occurrences.\n   - The last block (480-488) contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in a 488-page book have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's: 188\n- Number of 8's: 98\n- Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think. The first 4 is at 4, and the last one within 488 would be 484. To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, and then check if there's a 4 in the next numbers. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that means there are 48 full groups where 4 appears once each in the units place, plus one more at 484. So that's 49 times? Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. Hmm, let me check: from 4 to 484, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so from 4 to 484, that's 484/10 = 48.4, but since we can't have a fraction, it's 48 times, plus the 4 in 484, making it 49 times. Wait, but 484 is the 49th number because starting from 4, every 10th number adds one. So yes, 49 times for units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count them: - 40-49: 10 numbers - 140-149: 10 numbers - 240-249: 10 numbers - 340-349: 10 numbers - 440-449: 10 numbers But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440 is included, right? Yes, because 440 is less than 488. So 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book ends at 488, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, and the last one is 488. So that's 49 times, right? Because 8, 18, ..., 488. So 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 numbers - 280-289: 10 numbers - 380-389: 10 numbers - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So total is 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear \u2192 0 times.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think. The first occurrence is at 4 and the last one before 488 would be 484. So, how many terms are in this sequence? The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. Here, first term is 4, last term is 484, common difference is 10. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count them: - 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nBut wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, all these ranges are valid. So, that's 5 ranges \u00d7 10 numbers each = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. Let's see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. Total number of 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, now I need to do the same for the digit 8. Let's go through each place again. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find the last occurrence. The last page is 488, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many terms? First term is 8, last term is 488, common difference 10. Number of terms = ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is included, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of the range. So, does 480-488 count? Yes, but only up to 488. So, how many 8's in the tens place? - 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nWait, let me confirm: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (since 480 has 8 in the tens place, 481, etc., up to 488). So, that's 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Hmm, that seems correct. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding them up: Units place: 49, Tens place: 49, Hundreds place: 0. Total number of 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484.

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the total number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra in the last partial decade. The total number of decades is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. So, there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, which is 48 times. But wait, in the last partial decade, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 484 is included, which is another 4. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so the units digits go from 0 to 8 in the 48th decade, which is 480-488. So, 484 is included, so yes, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 times the digit 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 1-99, there's one block (40-49), in 100-199, another block (140-149), and so on. Let's calculate how many complete hundreds there are. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Wait, no, actually, each hundred block is 100 numbers, so 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. So, how many blocks where the tens digit is 4? In each hundred, there's a block from x40 to x49, where x is the hundreds digit. So, for 1-100, it's 40-49 (10 times). For 101-200, it's 140-149 (10 times). Similarly, 240-249 and 340-349. So, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So, that's another 10. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 times. Wait, no, because 401-488 is the fifth hundred, but only up to 488. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's are 4*10 (from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349) plus 10 from 440-449, totaling 50. Wait, but 40-49 is in 1-100, so that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in page numbers from 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these page numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 49 times. Tens place: 50 times. Hundreds place: 89 times. Total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? It's the same as the number of complete decades plus any extra in the last partial decade. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, which is 488, so the last units digit is 8, so that's another one. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is within 488, so let's see. Each of these blocks contributes 10 times, except maybe the last one if it's partial. Let's calculate. From 1-99: 80-89 is one block, 10 times. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488? Wait, no, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, right? Because 480 is 4 8 0, so the tens digit is 8. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, in the hundreds place 4, the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place in page numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's are 188, total 8's are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't overcount in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. For 8's in the tens place, I had 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Units place: 49. So, 98 total. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 times (48 full decades + 1 extra in the last partial decade).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Total: 50 times (4 full hundreds blocks + 10 in the last partial hundred).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 times.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Total: 49 times (4 full hundreds blocks + 9 in the last partial hundred).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place (pages go up to 488).\n   - Total: 0 times.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me think. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one such number. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, it's 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then the 480-488 range, where 484 is the last one with a 4 in the units place. So, that's 49 times. Wait, is that right? Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 480-489), but since we're only going up to 488, the last decade is 480-488, which has 488-480+1 = 9 numbers. So, in the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 (from the first 48 decades) plus one more in 484, making it 49. Wait, but 480-488 includes 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, yes, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count these. Each of these blocks is 10 numbers long. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, right? So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, in the hundreds place, each number from 400-488 has a hundreds digit of 4. So, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, let's add up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, and then the last partial decade 480-488, which includes 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488: the tens digit is 8 in 480-488? Wait, no. Wait, 480-488: the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488 when the tens digit is 8, but 480 has tens digit 8? Wait, no. Wait, 480 is 4-8-0, so the tens digit is 8. So, 480-488 includes numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, how many such blocks? Let's see: 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, right? Wait, no: 480 is 4-8-0, so tens digit is 8. 481 is 4-8-1, same. Up to 488, which is 4-8-8. So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, the blocks are: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, total in the tens place: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 in the last partial block, totaling 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. 188 - 98 = 90. That seems correct. But let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. For the tens place in 4's, I had 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. That's correct. For units place in 4's, 49 times. Similarly, for 8's, units and tens each 49, so total 98. So, yes, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (from 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- Total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (from 8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n- Total 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488, plus any extra if the last partial set has a 4. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Now, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is another 4. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one block, contributing 10. From 100-199: 140-149 is another, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, total 4's in tens place: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Wait, but actually, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the units place. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 8. Now, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. So, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last partial block. Each full block (like 80-89) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's count how many full blocks there are. From 1-99: 80-89 is one block, 10 8's. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, in the tens place, how many 8's? For each full block, 10. There are 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10, so 4 x 10 = 40. Then, the last block from 480-488 contributes 9 8's in the tens place (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so each of these 9 numbers has an 8 in the tens place. So, 9 more. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me verify the 4's again: Units place: 48 full tens, plus 1 in 484, so 49. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. Now for the 8's: Units place: 48 full tens, plus 1 in 488, so 49. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds: total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct.

    "text": " Let me see. The first occurrence is at 4 and the last in the units place would be 484. So, how many numbers is that? Well, from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms can be calculated by (484 - 4)/10 + 1. That's (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 484 is the 49th term. So, that's 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is up to 449, which is less than 488, so that's valid. Let's count each set: - 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 appears in the tens place. - 140-149: another 10. - 240-249: another 10. - 340-349: another 10. - 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 times. Wait, but wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? So, 5*10=50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place would be 488. How many terms? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1. That's (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is valid. Let's count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds place never has an 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each group of 10, the units digit is 4 exactly once, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial group, the units digit goes from 481 to 488, which includes 484, so that's one more 4. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's correct. So total tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 exactly 89 times. So, hundreds place 4's: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me compute that: 49 + 50 = 99, then 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, similar to 4's, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit includes 488, so that's one more 8. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). Now, from 400-488: The next block would be 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many complete blocks of 10 do we have? 4 blocks (80-89, etc.) each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial block, 480-488, we have 9 8's in the tens place. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. The tens place for 8's: each block of 100 has one block where tens digit is 8, contributing 10 8's. So from 0-99: 80-89 (10). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). That's 4 blocks, 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, that's 9 more. So, total 40+9=49. That's correct. So, 49 in tens place. Units place: 49. Hundreds:0. Total 8's: 98. 4's:188. Difference:90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many blocks of 10 are there in 488? That's 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a block, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, that would give us 48 occurrences, but actually, the last block is 480-488, and 484 is within that block, so we do have a 4 in the units place there. So, actually, it's 48 times plus one more for the 484? Wait, no, because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the number of complete blocks is 48, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, let me check: from 1 to 480, that's 48 blocks of 10, each with a 4 in the units place. Then from 481 to 488, we have 484 as the 4 in the units place. So that's one more, making it 49. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as floor division. The formula is usually (n + 9) // 10, where n is the total number. So, (488 + 9) // 10 = 497 // 10 = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in 1-99, we have 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then in 100-199, 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, using the same logic as with 4's, (488 + 9) // 10 = 497 // 10 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that range. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences except the last one, which contributes 9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488). Let me count: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 ranges with 10 each and one with 9. So, total is 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Let's see, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4. Well, every 10 numbers, there's one such number. So, the total number of 4's in the units place would be the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? The last number ending with 4 before 488 is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 488 pages, how many hundreds are there? Well, 488 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each hundred, there's a range where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. So, for each of the 4 full hundreds, that's 4 times 10 = 40 numbers. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 401-488 is 88 numbers, so does 440-449 fall within that? Yes, because 440 is greater than 401 and less than 488. So, yes, that's another 10. So, total 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. Hmm, but let me double-check. Units place: 48 times. Tens place: 50 times. Hundreds place: 89 times. So total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full occurrences. But wait, 488 ends with an 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place for 8's: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 in the tens place appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. So, how many such ranges are there? Each hundred has a range where the tens digit is 8, except perhaps the last one. Let's see: from 1-488, the hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. In each full hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.), the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, for 4 full hundreds, that's 4 times 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 occurrences. So, total in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place for 8's: 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, but I feel like that might be correct, but let me think again. Wait, when counting the units place for 8's, I considered 488 as the last number, which ends with 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. Similarly, for the tens place in 8's, in the last partial hundred, 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. So, 40 from the full hundreds plus 9 from the last partial hundred: 49. That seems right. For the 4's, in the tens place, I had 50 because in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 from the full hundreds plus 10 from the last partial hundred: 50. That seems correct. And in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, adding up, 48+50+89=187 for 4's, and 49+49=98 for 8's. So, 187-98=89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, totaling 50 times (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, totaling 49 times (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Let's see, the first such number is 4 and the last is 484. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find the count, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: (Last term - First term) / Common difference + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449? Since the book has 488 pages, 449 is within the range, so yes, that's valid. So, 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 ends with an 8, so the last such number is 488. So, the sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. Using the same formula: (488 -8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-488: how many numbers? 488 -480 +1=9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   Number of terms:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n   Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges.  \n   Total: \\(5 \\times 10 = 50\\) occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488.  \n   Number of terms:  \n   \\[\n   488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n   \\]\n   Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n\\(49 + 50 + 89 = 188\\)\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   Number of terms:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n   Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9.  \n   Total: \\(4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\\) occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   8 does not appear as the hundreds digit since the book ends at 488.  \n   Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n\\(49 + 49 + 0 = 98\\)\n\n**Difference:**  \n\\(188 - 98 = 90\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, there's one such number. So, total number of 4's in the units place would be the total number of complete groups of 10 in 488. That's 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, it's 48 times. But wait, does 488 include another 4 in the units place? Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, meaning 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers long, so each contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's one range, then 140-149 is another, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? So that's five ranges. Each contributes 10 4's, so 5 times 10 is 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, so that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 minus 400 plus 1, which is 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, meaning 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so does that add another 8 in the units place? Let me check: 488 ends with an 8, so yes, that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. Wait, no, because from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) + 1 if 488 mod 10 is 8. Let me compute: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, we add 1, making it 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last range. Let me count how many full ranges there are. 80-89: that's one, 180-189: another, 280-289: another, 380-389: another, and 480-488: that's part of the fifth range. Each full range (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. But 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, each full range contributes 10 8's, and the last partial range contributes 9. So, how many full ranges are there before 480? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's four full ranges, each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Then, the last range is 480-488, which contributes 9 8's in the tens place. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4 for the numbers 1-488. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the highest is 4 in 400-488. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that's 98 8's. But wait, let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in tens place. Similarly, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. That's 40. Then, 480-488: that's 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, 40 + 9 = 49. So, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. So, number of 4's is 187, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98. Let me compute that: 187 minus 98. 187 - 90 is 97, then minus 8 more is 89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to miscount. Let me verify the 4's again: units place: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, +89=187. That seems right. For the 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the units place for 8's. Let me check again. When counting the units place for 8's, I said that 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, and since 488 mod 10 is 8, we add 1, making it 49. But wait, is that correct? Let me list some numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms are there? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, yes, 49 terms, so 49 8's in the units place. Similarly, in the tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 4's:187, 8's:98. Difference:187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers, e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the last partial cycle might have another 4. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so the last full cycle ends at 480, and then we have 481-488. So, in the units place, we have 48 times where the digit is 4. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99, there's 40-49, which is one range. From 100-199, 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's a total of 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8 in the units place. The last partial cycle is 481-488, which includes 488, so that's another 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is one. From 100-199: 180-189 is another. Similarly, 280-289 and 380-389. That's 4 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Wait, but 380-389 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 40 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, there are 89 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 98. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems right. For 8's: units 49, tens 40. 49+40=89. So, 187-89=98. Hmm, that seems correct.

    "text": " Let me see, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles of 10, and then 8 extra numbers. In each full cycle, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but the last block is 440-449, and then 450-488. So, actually, 440-449 is the last full block, and then 450-488 doesn't add another block. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only up to 449. After that, 450-488, the tens digit is 5, 6, etc. So, yes, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, total 4's in hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, plus 1 more in the last partial ten, so 49. Tens: 5 blocks of 10, so 50. Hundreds: 89. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, okay, maybe that's correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial cycle (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, each block from 80-89, 180-189, etc., except the last one, which is only 9 numbers. So, let's count: from 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189 is 10. 200-299: 280-289 is 10. 300-399: 380-389 is 10. 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book has 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 4's would be less. Let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct. So, the total 4's are 188, 8's are 98, so the difference is 90. But wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the tens place for 4's. I said 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. The blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50. That seems correct. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, I have 5 blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, totaling 49. So, that seems correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. Wait, but I think I might have miscounted the 8's in the tens place. Let me recount. The tens digit is 8 in the ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so that's 9. So, total 40 +9=49. That's correct. So, the total 8's are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, okay, I think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - There are 48 full cycles of 10 in 480, contributing 48 times.  \n   - In the last partial cycle (481-488), 484 has a 4 in the units place.  \n   - **Total units place 4's:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges.  \n   - **Total tens place 4's:** 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488.  \n   - This is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.  \n   - **Total hundreds place 4's:** 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - There are 48 full cycles of 10, contributing 48 times.  \n   - In the last partial cycle (481-488), 488 has an 8 in the units place.  \n   - **Total units place 8's:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 8 appears in the tens place in ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.  \n   - The first four ranges each contribute 10 numbers, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9 numbers.  \n   - **Total tens place 8's:** (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - Since the book has 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8.  \n   - **Total hundreds place 8's:** 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think. The first occurrence is at 4 and the last occurrence in the units place would be 484, which is 484 = 400 + 84, so 484 is within 488. The sequence of units digits with 4 is every 10 numbers, so from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49 times. Wait, but 484 is the last one, so yeah, 49 times. But wait, does 484 count as a units place 4? Yes, because the units digit is 4. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49 (which is 10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 times. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it's 488, so the units digit is 8. So, starting from 8, every 10 numbers up to 488. The first is 8, the last is 488. How many terms? Let me calculate: (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49 times. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can't be 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, hundreds place: 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For 4's: Units: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total 188. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total 98. Difference: 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me see, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place. The first such number is 4, then every 10th number after that. So, the count would be the number of times 4 appears in the units place. To calculate this, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that means there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. However, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many ranges is that? 0-99: 1 range, 100-199: 1, 200-299:1, 300-399:1, 400-488:1. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 x 10 = 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. Pages from 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Wait, but the problem is about digits, so each occurrence in the hundreds place counts as one 4. So, 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times does this happen? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. The last number would be 488, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. The ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me check if 480-489 is included, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of this. So, how many ranges are there? From 0-99: 80-89 is one. 100-199: 180-189 is another. 200-299: 280-289. 300-399: 380-389. 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, how many full ranges? The first four ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10 numbers. The last partial range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 ranges x 10 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, 40 + 9 = 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 49 + 0 = 97. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) minus 97 (number of 8's) equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (every 10th number).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (ranges 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (pages 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (every 10th number).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (ranges 80-89, 180-189, etc., plus 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's = 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me see: The first 4 in the units place is 4, and the last one before 488 would be 484. So, the numbers are 4, 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94, 104, 114, ..., 484. To find how many there are, I can calculate how many sets of 10 are there up to 488. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets, which gives 48 occurrences, but wait, the last one is 484, which is the 49th occurrence because 484 is 48*10 + 4. Wait, actually, maybe a better way is to calculate it as (488 + 1) / 10, but I think I might be overcomplicating. Let me think: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So the number of such numbers is floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1. Let me compute that: (488 - 4) is 484, divided by 10 is 48.4, floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. These numbers would be 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449. Let me count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such sets are there? From 40-49 (that's one set), then 140-149 (second), 240-249 (third), 340-349 (fourth), and 440-449 (fifth). So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. Wait, but wait: 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. The numbers here would be 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, I'm only interested in how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but wait: the problem is about how many times 4 is printed, so each occurrence is counted once per digit. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 ends with 8, so that's included. Let me calculate how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first is 8, then every 10 numbers. So, the number of such numbers is floor((488 - 8)/10) + 1. (488 - 8)=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Each of these sets (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. Let me count how many such sets there are. 80-89: that's one set, 180-189: second, 280-289: third, 380-389: fourth, and 480-488: fifth. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the tens place, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 8's, so that's 4*10=40. The last set, 480-488, contributes 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 occurrences. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait: when I count 80-89, that's 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. Similarly for 180-189, etc. So, yes, 4 sets of 10, which is 40, plus the 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. For 8's: units: 49, tens: 49. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the hundreds place for 4's, I thought that from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89. But let me confirm: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Yes, that's correct. So, 89 in the hundreds place for 4's. For 8's in the tens place, I had 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 40 + 9=49. That seems correct. Units place for both digits: 49 each. So, 4's total 188, 8's total 98, difference is 90. Wait, but let me think again about the 8's in the tens place. When I count 480-488, that's 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct. So, I think my calculations are right.

    "text": " Let me see. The first occurrence is at 4, and the last within 488 is 484. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. Here, first term is 4, last term is 484, common difference is 10. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 can be in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449, right? Let me count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, so each set contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such sets are there? From 40-49 (that's one set), then 140-149 (another set), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 numbers each = 50 times. Wait, but hold on, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can be in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. But in this range, the hundreds digit is always 4, so that's 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. So, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is included, right? So, starting from 8, the last one would be 488. Let me calculate how many terms. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. The 8 can be in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, how many sets? Let me see: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 5 sets, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, total for tens place: 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 for the last set, so 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 8 can be in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times. So, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " Let me think. The first occurrence is at 4, and the last occurrence before 488 would be 484. So, from 4 to 484, how many numbers are there? Well, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part. Wait, but 484 is 48*10 + 4, so that's 49 numbers? Wait, no, because starting from 4, each set of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 have a 4 in the units place? No, it's 8. So, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is within 488. So, 48 times. Wait, but starting from 4, which is the first occurrence, so 4,14,...,484. That's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49 times. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to maybe 440-449? Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449. Each of these sets has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such sets are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first set, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 numbers, but we're only interested in the count of 4's in the tens place, which is 5 sets *1 (since each set has exactly one 4 in the tens place per number, but actually, each number in the set has a 4 in the tens place, so each set contributes 10 4's. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, each set has 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place, so that's 10 4's per set. So, 5 sets would give 5*10=50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but does the last set go up to 449? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 50 4's. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. That would be from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in sets like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these sets has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such sets are there? Let's see: 80-89 is the first, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 sets. Each set contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40 8's. Wait, but let me check if 480-489 is included, but since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 is part of the hundreds place, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, right? Wait, no, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, so that's another set, but only 9 numbers (480-488). So, that's an additional set, but only 9 numbers. So, how does that affect the count? Let me think. So, the sets are: 80-89: 10 numbers, 8 in tens place. 180-189: 10 numbers. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. And then 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 4 full sets and one partial set. Each full set contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. The partial set, 480-488, has 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place, so 9 more 8's. So, total 40+9=49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought 4 sets, but now it's 4 full sets plus one partial. So, 4 full sets: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 8's, so 40. Then 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 more. So, total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 4 (for 400-488) or less. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book is only 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 8's. Let me recount the tens place for 8's. The sets are: 80-89:10 numbers, each with 8 in tens place. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. And then 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 4 full sets (40 numbers) and 9 partial, totaling 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. That seems correct. So, 49 units, 49 tens, 0 hundreds: 98 total 8's. 4's: 49 units, 50 tens, 89 hundreds: 188 total. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers (from 4 to 484, inclusive).\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n   **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers (from 8 to 488, inclusive).\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each full range contributes 10 occurrences, and the partial range 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book only has 488 pages.\n\n   **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - **Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me see. The first occurrence is at 4, and the last occurrence within 488 would be at 484. So, how many numbers is that? Well, from 0 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles and then a partial cycle. But since we're only counting up to 488, the last number is 488, which ends with an 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 times 1 (since each cycle has one 4). Wait, no, actually, each cycle of 10 has exactly one 4 in the units place, right? So, from 1 to 488, how many full tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times 1 is 48. But wait, 48 times 10 is 480, so the 48th cycle ends at 480. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no additional 4's in the units place beyond 480. So, total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. But wait, in our case, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range would be 440-449, since 450-488 would have 5 in the hundreds place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49). Similarly, in 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10. Then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers, so 5 ranges (from 0-49, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, no, actually, it's 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, in each of these, except maybe the last one, there's a full set of 10 numbers. Let's see: From 0-99: 40-49: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149: 10. From 200-299: 240-249: 10. From 300-399: 340-349: 10. From 400-488: 440-449: 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5\u00d710=50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, but let me check: 400 is included, and 488 is the last, so yes, 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: Units place: 48, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. Total 4's: 48+50+89= 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48 8's. But wait, does 488 end with an 8? Yes, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, that's included in the 48. So, 48 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so the last range is 480-488. So, how many such ranges? Let's see: 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each of the first four ranges contributes 10, and the last one contributes 9. So, total 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: Units place:48, Tens place:49, Hundreds place:0. Total 8's:48+49=97. So, total 8's:97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) minus 97 (number of 8's) equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

    "text": " Let me think. The first occurrence is 4, and the last occurrence before 488 would be 484. So, how many numbers is that? Well, from 4 to 484, each step is 10. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included. So, yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check. From 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. 200-299: 240-249 is 10. 300-399: 340-349 is 10. 400-488: 440-449 is 10. So, yes, 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, how many times does the hundreds digit 4 appear? Each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4. So, that's 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many times? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488), right? Because 488 is the last page. So, let's break it down: - 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). - 100-199: 180-189 (10). - 200-299: 280-289 (10). - 300-399: 380-389 (10). - 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers). So, the first four ranges each have 10 numbers, and the last one has 9. So, total is 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

Wait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so it's 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. The first range is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. So, pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, that's 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? Again, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, meaning 48 numbers ending with 8. But wait, does 488 end with 8? Yes, 488 is included, so actually, it's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, because 488 is the 49th occurrence. Let me check: from 1 to 488, the numbers ending with 8 are 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is given by ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place, such as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 380-389 is okay, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. So, how many ranges are there? 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-489: but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, for the tens place, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total for tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers each, contributing 10 times the digit 8 in the tens place. The last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so that's 9 times. So, total tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above, but the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (every 10 numbers).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (10 numbers each in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488 inclusive).\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (every 10 numbers, including 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (10 numbers each in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 9 in 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Let me see. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the total number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a group, it's 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last number, so the 48th group would end at 480, and then there's 481-488. So, in the units place, 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so 48 times up to 480, and then in 484, which is within 481-488, so that's an additional 1. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the ranges are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. But wait, 488 is included, so in the 48th group, 488 is the last number, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, no. Wait, 488 is the 48th group? Let me think. The first group is 1-10, the second 11-20, etc. So, 488 is in the 48th group (since 48*10=480, so 481-490 would be the 49th group, but we only go up to 488). So, in the units place, 8 appears once every 10 numbers, so from 1-488, how many times? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full times, and then in the 489th number, which is 488, the 8 appears once. Wait, no, 488 is the 488th number, so in the units place, the last 8 is at 488, which is the 48th occurrence. Wait, because 8, 18, ..., 488. So, how many terms are there? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. Let's solve for n: 10(n-1) \u2264 480 \u2192 n-1 \u2264 48 \u2192 n \u2264 49. So, there are 49 terms where 8 appears in the units place. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges are within 1-488. 80-89: yes, 180-189: yes, 280-289: yes, 380-389: yes. 480-489 would be the next, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, the 480-489 range is only partially included. So, in the tens place, 8 appears in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40. But wait, in the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, that's 9 occurrences. So, total tens place 8's: 40 (from the first four ranges) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49. Wait, but earlier I thought 480-489 would be a full range, but since we only go up to 488, it's only 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought units place was 49 and tens place was 49, so total 98. But let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98. Now, the number of 4's was 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 8's in the tens place. Let me recount. The tens place 8's: 80-89: 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 ranges, 10 each, so 40. Then, 480-488: 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), each with an 8 in the tens place. So, 9 more. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct. So, 49 in tens place, 49 in units place, total 98. So, 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:188-98=90. Hmm, but let me check if I counted the 4's correctly. Units place:49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. Let me think about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. That's correct. For the tens place of 4's, it's 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's, so 50. Correct. Units place:49, as we have 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4, and then 484 as the 49th. So, 49. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. So, 188 4's, 98 8's, difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - There are 49 such numbers (48 full groups of 10 and one additional in 484).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 5 ranges.\n   - Each range contributes 10 4's, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - There are 49 such numbers.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 4 full ranges contributing 10 each (40).\n   - Additionally, 480-488 contributes 9 more 8's.\n   - Total tens place 8's = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me see. The first occurrence is at 4 and the last one before 488 would be 484. To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can calculate how many groups of 10 there are in 488 and then see how many 4's are in each group. Wait, maybe a better way is to divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 times. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups. But actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so the number of 4's in the units place is 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each with a 4 in the units place). But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 have a units digit of 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is 48*10 + 4, so yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: from 1-99, there's one block (40-49), which is 10 pages. Then from 100-488, how many blocks? The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for hundreds digit 1, 2, 3, each has a block 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, each contributing 10 4's. Then, for hundreds digit 4, the block would be 440-449, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, right? Wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's another 10. So total for tens place: 1 (from 40-49) + 3 (from 140-149, 240-249, 340-349) + 1 (from 440-449) = 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's. So that's 5*10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: from 1-99: 40-49 is 10 4's in the tens place. Then 100-199: 140-149 is 10. 200-299: 240-249 is 10. 300-399: 340-349 is 10. 400-488: 440-449 is 10. So that's 5 blocks, each with 10, so 50. So total 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be pages 400-488. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, but wait, 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. So total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So 48 4's. Tens place: as above, 5 blocks of 10, so 50. Hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89. So total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Now, let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can use a formula. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor(n/10). Similarly, for the tens place, it's floor(n/100)*10 + something, but maybe it's easier to count manually as I did before. Now, moving on to 8's. Let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, the units digit is 8 once. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8. So 48 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Let's count how many such blocks exist up to 488. From 1-99: 80-89 is one block, 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So in the hundreds place 4, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. So 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. So total 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in the tens or units place. For 4's: units place: 48, tens place:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units:48, tens:49, hundreds:0. 48+49=97. So 187-97=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. For the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 48 times. But for the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, while 8 appears 49 times. So 50-49=1 more 4 in the tens place. For the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, while 8 appears 0 times. So 89-0=89 more 4's in the hundreds place. So total more 4's: 1 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 90. Yeah, that matches. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\) times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\) times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Total: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\) times.\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\) times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 occurrences, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\) times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 times.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 48 + 49 + 0 = 97 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n- More 4's than 8's: \\( 187 - 97 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{90}\\)"

From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. From 200-299: 240-249 is 10. From 300-399: 340-349 is 10. From 400-488: 440-449 is 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So total 50 numbers where 4 is in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 4's appear 187 times. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Since 488 is included, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th. Wait, 8,18,...,488. The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Because starting from 8 (1st), 18 (2nd), ..., 488 is the 49th. So units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8's in the tens place occur in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count each range: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8's in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, 8's appear 98 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, +89=187. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So 187-98=89. Yeah, that seems right. So, 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484) gives 48 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** Every 100 numbers in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   \n   Total '4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers up to 488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** Ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last range being 480-488 (9 numbers), totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No occurrences as the book ends at 488.\n   \n   Total '8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - More '4's than '8's = 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place would be the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, it's 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times. But wait, the last group would be 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 480-488 includes 484, which is another 4 in the units place. So, actually, it's 49 times. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as (488 + 1) divided by 10, which is 48.9, so 48 full times, but since 488 is included, maybe it's 49. Wait, let me check. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, starting at 4, 14, 24,..., 484. The last one is 484, which is the 49th occurrence because 484 is the 49th multiple of 10 minus 6. Wait, maybe a better way is to calculate it as (488 - 4) / 10 + 1. Let me see: (488 - 4) is 484, divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 full groups, plus 1 for the starting number 4. So, 49 times. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. This happens in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting at 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? Similar to the 4's, from 1 to 488, the number of 8's in the units place is (488 - 8) / 10 + 1. (488 - 8) = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So, each of these ranges except the last one has 10 numbers, but the last one (480-488) has 9 numbers because 489 is beyond 488. So, let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 480-488 is correct. The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 8's in the tens place for that range. So, total tens place 8's: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake in counting. Let me verify the units place for 4's: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place, starting at 4. The last one is 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 is correct. Tens place for 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five ranges, each contributing 10 4's, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89. Total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For 8's: Units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. Total 8's: 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences (since the book ends at 488).\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think: The first occurrence is at 4, and the last within 488 is 484. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? It's an arithmetic sequence where the first term a1=4, the common difference d=10, and the last term l=484. The formula for the nth term is a_n = a1 + (n-1)d. So, 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 4 from both sides: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n=49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. Wait, but 484 is the 49th term because starting from 4, adding 10 each time, so 4 is the 1st, 14 is the 2nd, ..., 484 is the 49th. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block, so that's 10 4's. From 100-199: 140-149 is another block, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. Now, 400-488: Here, 440-449 is another block, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, how many blocks is that? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5*10=50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but I need to check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these contributes one 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, let me check: 400 is the first, 401, 402,..., up to 488. So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 end with an 8? Yes, 488 is included. So, how many terms? The first term is 8, last term is 488. Using the same arithmetic sequence formula: a1=8, d=10, l=488. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 8: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n-1, so n=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Each of these blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except possibly the last one if it doesn't complete the block. Let's check: From 0-99: 80-89 is one block, 10 8's. 100-199: 180-189, another 10. 200-299: 280-289, another 10. 300-399: 380-389, another 10. 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-489 is a block, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many 8's in the tens place here? Each number from 480-488 has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the tens place. So, for the 400-488 range, we have 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in tens place: 10. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, total 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete groups of 10, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, so 48 times. But wait, does the 48th group end at 480, and then 481-488 is the next group, which doesn't complete. So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks is 10 numbers long. Let's count how many such blocks exist up to 488. The blocks are at 40-49 (first block), 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times. Wait, but the last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98 + 89 = 187. So, 4 appears 187 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so does that mean 48 times or 49? Let me check. The last 8 in the units place is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one. So, from 8 to 488, that's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block is 10 numbers, and each block contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks exist up to 488. The blocks are at 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. So, that's 4 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40 times. Wait, but the next block would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 in 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, in the tens place, how many times does 8 appear? Let's see: 80-89: 10 times, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 times (since 488 is included). So, total tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49 times. Wait, but earlier I thought of 4 blocks, but the 480-488 is the fifth block but incomplete. So, the total is 4\u00d710 +9=49. So, tens place: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the difference is number of 4's minus number of 8's: 187 - 98 = 89.

So, units place gives 48 fours. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count these. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers, so 10 fours in the tens place. Similarly, 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. Now, 440-449: that's another 10. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is fully included. So that's 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, there are 187 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, similar to the 4's in units place, how many are there? From 8 to 488, every 10 numbers. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, meaning 48 eights. But wait, in the last group, 480-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included. So, 48 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-489 would be another set, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488. Wait, actually, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, adding up: 10 (80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 187 (fours) - 97 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 48 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each range contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such ranges, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, contributing 89 fours.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 48 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let's see, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, it's 48 times. Wait, but actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups and then 8 extra pages. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, the last group is from 481 to 488, which includes 484, so that's another 4 in the units place. So, maybe it's 49 times? Wait, let me think again. From 1 to 480, that's 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then from 481 to 488, the next page with a 4 in the units place is 484, so that's one more, making it 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's one range, 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's five ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50 times. So, the digit 4 appears 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4. This happens in the range 400-488. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488. But each page number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? From 1 to 488, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is the number of complete groups of 10, which is 488 / 10 = 48.8. So, 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. But wait, the last group is from 481 to 488, which includes 488, so that's another 8 in the units place, making it 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This happens in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488). Let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 only for 480-488, right? So, in each range, except the last one, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. And 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total is 4 ranges with 10 each and one range with 9. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can only be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), or 4 (400-488). So, the hundreds digit is never 8 in this book. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (from 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, contributing 10 times per range.

    "text": " Let me see. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, how many complete cycles of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete cycles and an extra 8 numbers. In each complete cycle, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 times. Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 is included, which is another 4. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, right? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 is 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete cycles, each contributing one 8. Plus, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the last block. Let's count how many full blocks and partial blocks. The first block is 80-89: 10 numbers. Then 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Then 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, how many 8's in the tens place? Each full block has 10, so 4 blocks * 10 = 40. The last block has 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place, so 9 more. Total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete cycles of 10, contributing 48 fours. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include another 4, totaling 49 fours.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 fours, totaling 50 fours.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, contributing 89 fours.\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 40 eights, and the partial block 480-488 contributes 9 eights, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's appear here.\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me see. The first occurrence is at 4, and the last is at 484. To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48 full groups of 10, and then 8 extra numbers. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, the 48th group would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the 484 is within that. So, from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? Well, 484 is 48*10 + 4, so that's 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 times. But wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Oh, I see, I missed the last one. So, actually, it's 49 times in the units place. Because when you include both the first and last term, you add 1. So, units place: 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10 = 50 fours. But wait, does 440-449 end at 449, which is before 488, so yes, that's fine. So, tens place: 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see if 480-489 is included, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, each of these ranges contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, in the hundreds place, 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, for the tens place: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one range of 9 (480-488). So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, same for 180-189, etc. But 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, tens place: 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Therefore, total number of eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me think again. Did I count correctly in the tens place for eights? From 80-89: 10 eights. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. And 480-488: 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. For fours in the tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Yes. And hundreds place for fours: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Eights: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide both sides by 10: 48 = n - 1. So, n = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within range, but 450-488 would have 4 in the hundreds place, but not in the tens. Let me count each set: - 40-49: that's 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place. - 140-149: another 10 numbers. - 240-249: another 10. - 340-349: another 10. - 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 occurrences. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can be in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Wait, but wait a second. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. So, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I need to count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same arithmetic sequence approach: an = a1 + (n-1)d. Here, a1=8, d=10, an=488. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 8: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n - 1. So, n=49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let me count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 = 9). So, that's 5 sets, but the last set has only 9 numbers instead of 10. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait, 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, that's 4 full decades and a partial. So, total 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, there are 48 full cycles of 10. But wait, the last partial cycle might have a 4 in the units place. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so the last number with a 4 in the units place is 484, which is within the range. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 49? Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, and 484 is the last number with a 4 in the units place, which is 484 = 48*10 + 4. So, actually, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 times from 4 to 484, but wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 is 48*10 + 4, so that's 48 times. Wait, but when I count from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (1-480) and then 481-488. So, in each cycle of 10, there's one 4 in the units place. So, 48 cycles would give 48 4's, and then in 481-488, there's 484, which is another 4. So, total 49 4's in the units place? Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so the units digit goes up to 8. So, in the last partial cycle (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 is included once (484). So, total 4's in units place: 48 (from 1-480) +1 (484) = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, from 1-488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. In each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each. So, that's 4*10 = 40. Now, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 401-410. Wait, no, 401-410 would have tens digit 0, right? Wait, no, 401-410: the tens digit is 0 for 401-410? Wait, no, 401 is 4 0 1, so the tens digit is 0. Then, the next set where the tens digit is 4 would be 440-449, but 440-449 is within 401-488. So, that's another 10 numbers. So, total 40 +10=50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 more. So, total 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 188 4's. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, in the last partial cycle (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So, total 48 +1=49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Each full block (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. In each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers each, so 4*10=40. Now, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers here. So, total 40 +9=49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4, plus one more in 484. Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes 10 4's. There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, plus one more in 488. Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block contributes 10 8's. There are 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and a partial block 480-488, contributing 9 8's. Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place (800-899 exceeds 488). Total: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, that means there are 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page. So, in the 480-488 range, the units digit goes from 0 to 8, so 484 is included. So, that would be 48 times, right? But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, it's 48 full tens, each giving one 4, so 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the 48th ten? Let me check: 10-19 is the first ten, 20-29 the second, and so on. So, the last ten is 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the last ten is 480-488. So, in each ten, the units digit 4 appears once. So, 48 tens would give 48 instances of 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers long. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, and the book ends at 488, so 440-449 is entirely within the book. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, is that correct? Let me see: 40-49: yes, 10 numbers. 140-149: yes, 10. 240-249: yes, 10. 340-349: yes, 10. 440-449: yes, 10. So, 5 ranges, 10 each, so 50 times. So, 50 instances of 4 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4. This occurs in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 instances. So, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187 instances of the digit 4. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so in the 480-488 range, the units digit 8 appears once. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This happens in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-489 would be 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, let's count the ranges: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers. So, that's 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, total is 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 instances of 8 in the tens place. Wait, but let me double-check: 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. Yes, that's 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place because 800-899 would be beyond 488. So, 0 instances. So, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places: 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97 instances of the digit 8. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90.

    "text": " Let me see, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place. It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so let me check if 488 has a 4 in the units place. 488 ends with 8, so the last number with a 4 in the units place would be 484. So, from 4, 14, ..., 484, that's 48 times? Wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count these. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-488, how many hundreds are there? Well, 488 is less than 500, so we have four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, actually, 401-488 is part of the fifth hundred, but not a full hundred. Let's see, in each full hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 1-100: 40-49 is 10 numbers. 101-200: 140-149 is another 10. 201-300: 240-249 is another 10. 301-400: 340-349 is another 10. Now, 401-488: the tens digit here is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 10 each for four blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, that's actually five blocks because 440-449 is in the 401-488 range. So, that's 5 times 10, which is 50. Wait, but 401-488 only goes up to 488, so does 440-449 fit entirely within 401-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, totaling 50. Hmm, but wait, the first block is 40-49, which is in 1-100, so that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. That would be from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's are 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 ends with 8, that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, because 8,18,...,488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, how many numbers? The formula is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many full blocks there are. From 1-488, the blocks are 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). Now, 480-489 would be another block, but since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 is part of that block. So, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive, but 480-489 would be 10, but we only have up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers). Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 480 is the first, then 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 numbers. So, how many blocks? The first four blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, that's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, the 480-488 block contributes 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's verify the 4's count again. Units place: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 187. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. When I was counting the tens place, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5\u00d710=50. That seems correct. For the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. 484 is 48\u00d710 + 4, so that's 48 numbers. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence, right? Because 48\u00d710=480, plus 4 is 484. So, that's correct, 48 times. So, 48 +50 +89=187. For 8's, units place: 49 times because 488 is included, so that's correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9), totaling 49. So, 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can think of the total number of digits used and see if the counts make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I can write a small table to count the digits in each position. But maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the number of times each digit appears in each position. For units place: from 1 to 488, each digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place, except possibly the last digit if the total isn't a multiple of 10. So, for units place, total numbers:488. Each digit 0-9 appears floor(488/10)=48 times, and then the remaining 8 numbers (488-480=8) will have digits 0-7 in the units place. Wait, but wait, 488 is 48 full tens (480) plus 8 more numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, digits 1-8 appear once each in the last partial block. So, for digits 1-8, they appear 48+1=49 times, and digits 9 and 0 appear 48 times. Wait, but in our case, we're counting 4 and 8, which are both in 1-9, so they each appear 49 times in the units place. Wait, but earlier I thought 4's in units place were 48. Hmm, that's a contradiction. Let me think again. If from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each digit 0-9, they appear floor(488/10)=48 times, and then in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, each appearing once. So, digits 1-8 appear 48+1=49 times, and digits 9 and 0 appear 48 times. So, for 4 and 8, both are in 1-8, so they each appear 49 times in the units place. Wait, but earlier I thought 4's in units place were 48. That was a mistake. So, correction: units place for 4 is 49, not 48. Similarly, units place for 8 is 49. Hmm, so that changes things. Let me recalculate. So, for 4's: units place:49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. Total 4's:49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0. Total 8's:49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but earlier I thought 4's in units place were 48, but now it's 49. Which is correct? Let me take a specific example. From 1 to 10: units digits are 1-0. So, digit 4 appears once (at 4). From 11-20: 14. So, another 4. So, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-480, that's 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of 10, so 48 times 4 in units place. Then, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once more at 484. So, total 48+1=49 times in units place. So, yes, 49 times. So, I made a mistake earlier by stopping at 484, thinking it's 48 times, but actually, it's 49 times because 484 is included in 1-488, and 484 is the 48th occurrence, but wait, no, 484 is 48\u00d710 +4, so 48th occurrence would be at 484, but then 484 is the 48th occurrence, but then 484 is within 1-488, so that's correct. Wait, but then from 1-480, 48 occurrences, and then 484 is the 49th. So, 49 times. So, yes, 49. So, 4's in units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 4's:49+50+89=188. 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 8's:98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but earlier I thought 4's in units place were 48, but now it's 49. So, I need to correct that. So, the correct count is 49 for 4's in units, leading to total 4's as 188, and 8's as 98, so difference is 90. Let me confirm the tens place for 4's: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's five blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct. Hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place:49, tens place:49. So, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (1s place):** The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences because 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, and the integer part is 48, but since 484 is included, it's 49.\n   - **Tens Place (10s place):** The digit '4' appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place (100s place):** The digit '4' appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place (1s place):** The digit '8' appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences because 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, and the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49.\n   - **Tens Place (10s place):** The digit '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers), totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place (100s place):** There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
