    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra if the last number exceeds the next multiple of 10. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, there are 48 complete decades and 8 extra numbers. Each decade has exactly one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial decade (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which adds one more 4. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, let me check that again. From 1-10: 4 once. 11-20: 14 once. So, each 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last group is 481-488. In this group, 484 is present, which has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: from 1-99: 40-49, that's one range, contributing 10 numbers. Then 100-199: 140-149, another 10. 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is another 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is entirely within the book, so that's 10 more. So, how many ranges? From 1-99: 1 range, 10 numbers. Then each subsequent hundred has one range, so 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. That's 4 more ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So total ranges: 1 + 4 = 5, each with 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So total 4's in the tens place: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. Each number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, total 4's in hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial group, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 80-89, that's one range, 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189, another 10. 200-299: 280-289, another 10. 300-399: 380-389, another 10. 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, let me check: 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total ranges with 8 in the tens place: 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 numbers, and one partial range (480-488) contributing 9 numbers. So, total 8's in tens place: (4 * 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 48*10 is 480, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is within 488. So, 48 times. Wait, but let me check: from 1-488, how many numbers end with 4? It's actually 48 times because 488 / 10 = 48.8, so the integer part is 48. So, 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers), 100-199: 140-149 (10), 200-299: 240-249 (10), 300-399: 340-349 (10), and 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5*10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8. So, 48 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Now, from 0-99: 80-89 (10), 100-199: 180-189 (10), 200-299: 280-289 (10), 300-399: 380-389 (10). The next block would be 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought each block contributes 10, but in this case, the last block is incomplete. So, let's recalculate: From 0-399, how many 8's in the tens place? It's 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, 9 8's in the tens place. Therefore, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) = 97. So, total 8's are 97. Now, the difference is number of 4's minus number of 8's: 187 - 97 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For the 8's: units 48, tens 49. 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. Hmm, but wait, when counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) up to 380-389, which is 40, and then from 480-488, which is 9. So, 40+9=49. That seems right. But wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in tens place is 49. So, total 8's is 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 48 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 100: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 4's.\n   - Total: 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in page numbers 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences (488 - 400 + 1).\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 48 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 100: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389.\n   - Each block contributes 10 8's.\n   - From 400-488, 8 appears in 480-488 (9 numbers).\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in 800-899, so 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place is the total number of such blocks. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, the 488th page is 488, which is part of the 488th block. So, actually, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 (from 1-480) plus one more at 484? Wait, no, 484 is within 480-489, so 484 is the 48th occurrence in the units place. Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let me calculate it as follows: The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the total number of pages divided by 10, rounded down. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page. So, does that mean the 48th occurrence is at 480, and then 484 is the 49th? Wait, no, 480 is 480, so the units digit is 0, so 480 is not a 4 in the units place. The next 4 in the units place after 480 would be 484, which is within 481-490. So, from 1-480, how many 4's in units place? That's 480 / 10 = 48. Then, from 481-488, we have 484 as the next 4 in the units place, which is one more. So, total 49 times in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included. So, yes, 49 times. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as the number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488 is 49. Let me check that: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Yes, that makes sense. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 for numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 0-488, the blocks are: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. How many blocks are there? Well, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50 4's in the tens place. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's do the same process for 8's. 1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many 8's in units place? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8. But wait, the last block is 481-490, but the book only goes up to 488, so in the last block, 488 is included, which is an 8 in the units place. So, from 1-480, 48 8's, and then 488 adds one more, so total 49 8's in units place. Let me verify: 8,18,28,...,488. The first term is 8, last term is 488. Common difference 10. Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Yes, so 49 8's in units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? The tens digit is 8 for numbers from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except the last block, which might be less. Let's check: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in tens place. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so 9 8's in tens place. So, total 10+10+10+10+9=49 8's in tens place. Wait, let me confirm: From 80-89: 10. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page). So, 10*4 +9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (from 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, contributing 10 times per block.

There are 4 full blocks and a partial block (480-488), totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have exactly one 4 in the units place. So, total number of 4's in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning there are 48 full groups of 10, and then the 489th number is 488, which is beyond our range. So, actually, it's 48 times. But wait, let me check: from 4 to 484, that's every 10 numbers. So, 484 is the last number with a 4 in the units place. So, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, but since we're counting each occurrence, it's 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-488, we have 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50 times. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total number of 4's is 187. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is included. So, how many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is included, so that's 49 times. Wait, let me check: 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, n-1 = (488-8)/10 = 480/10=48, so n=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. So, how many full ranges? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. Then, 480-488 is another range, but only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, total for tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's appear here.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 488 include another 4 in the units place? Let me check: 484 is the last number before 488 where the units digit is 4. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place (tens digit):** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's a fifth block. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place (hundreds digit):** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 end with an 8? Yes, 488 is included. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, but since 488 is included, that's 49 times. Wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (each cycle being 10 numbers) and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, in each cycle, there's one 8 in the units place. So, 48 full cycles give 48 eights, and then in the last partial cycle, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there? From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389). Now, 488 is beyond 400, but does 480-489 fall within 488? Yes, 480-488 is part of the next block, but since 488 is the last page, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, each of these has an 8 in the tens place. So, that's an additional 9 eights. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because in the tens place, each block is 100 numbers, so 80-89 is the first block, then 180-189, etc. But 480-489 would be another block, but since the book only goes up to 488, we only have 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many blocks are there? The first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights in the tens place. Then, the next block is 480-488, contributing 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 4 x 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 89. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, when I counted the units place for 4's, I got 48. But let me check again: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. The last number is 484, which is 484. So, how many terms? The sequence starts at 4, ends at 484, with a common difference of 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that's 49 times, not 48. Oh no, I think I made a mistake earlier. I thought 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so I took 48, but actually, the last term is 484, which is 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10. So, solving for n: 484 = 4 + 10(n-1) => 480 = 10(n-1) => n-1=48 => n=49. So, units place for 4's is 49, not 48. Similarly, for 8's in the units place, I had 49, which seems correct because from 8,18,...,488, which is 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10 => 480 = 10(n-1) => n=49. So, both units places for 4 and 8 have 49 counts each. Wait, so I think I made a mistake in the initial count for 4's in units place. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50 (as before)\n- Hundreds place: 89 (as before)\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49 (as before)\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 187 - 98 = 89, but that was because I miscalculated the units place for 4's. So, the correct total for 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. I had 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. That seems correct because 440-449 is within 488. So, 50 is correct.\n\nAnd for hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 is correct.\n\nSo, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits: 49\nTens: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 40, plus 480-488, which is 9, so 40 + 9 = 49.\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 488 was included in the units place for 8's, which it is, so that's correct.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any other mistakes. Let me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits: 4,14,...,484: 49 numbers.\n\nTens: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So, 5 x10=50.\n\nHundreds: 400-488:89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits: 8,18,...,488:49.\n\nTens:80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4x10 +9=49.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, every set of 10 consecutive numbers has exactly one number ending with 4. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning there are 48 full sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. So, in the 488th page, the last number ending with 4 is 484, which is 48*10 + 4. So, yes, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one block, so 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, how many blocks? Let's see: 40-49 (1), 140-149 (2), 240-249 (3), 340-349 (4), and 440-449 (5). Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks mean 5*10=50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, meaning 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, meaning 48 times in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, which ends with 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. Hmm, let me check: from 1 to 488, the numbers ending with 8 are 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of such numbers is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such blocks there are within 488. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-489 would be the next block, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place would only go up to 488. So, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, so in the hundreds place, 4 is from 400-488, but the tens digit 8 would be in 480-488. So, for the tens place, how many blocks? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last one only has 9 numbers instead of 10. So, the first four blocks have 10 each, and the last one has 9. So, total in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me confirm: from 1-399, how many 8's in the tens place? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 blocks, 40 numbers. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = **187**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **89**\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 488 divided by 10 is exactly 48.8, so does that mean there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4, and then an extra 8 pages? Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, the last set is 480-488, which includes 484, so that's the 48th 4 in the units place. So, units place contributes 48 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the blocks are: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 fours each = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there here? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, from 1 to 488, how many 8's in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so again, 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, and the last set is 480-488, which includes 488. So, units place has 48 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. The blocks are: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see if 480-489 is included, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 380-389. So, how many blocks? 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 blocks. Each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (48) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 88 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 88 = 99.

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one number ending with 4. So, how many blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks and then 8 extra numbers. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times, right? Wait, but the last block is 481-490, but since the book ends at 488, the last number with 4 in the units place is 484. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let me calculate it as (488 // 10) + 1 if 488 % 10 >= 4. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. Since 8 is less than 4? No, wait, 8 is more than 4, so actually, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is within 480-488. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? Well, starting from 40-49 (which is 10 numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 440-449, which is within 488. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 numbers each = 50 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? Let's subtract 399 from 488: 488 - 399 = 89. So, there are 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. Therefore, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that happens. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, the last number is 488, which ends with an 8, so that's included. So, the number of 8's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence. Let me check: 8, 18, ..., 488. The first term is 8, the last term is 488, and the common difference is 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, but the last block (480-488) has only 9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488). So, how many 8's in the tens place? First, 4 full blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, and then 9 numbers in 480-488, so 9 more. So, 40 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but let me double-check. From 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. That's 4\u00d710=40. Then, 480-488: numbers are 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, 9 more. So total is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times. Wait, that can't be right because I thought the hundreds place would have some, but no, since the book is only 488 pages, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's are 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but earlier, I thought the units place was 49 and the tens place was 49, so total 98. Now, the number of 4's was 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 8's in the tens place. Let me recount: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. That's 4\u00d710=40. Then, 480-488: 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, 40 + 9 = 49. So, units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds: 0. So, total 8's: 98. Number of 4's: 187. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, but let me check the 4's again. Units place: 48, tens place:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, +89=187. That's correct. So, the difference is 89. But wait, I think I made a mistake in the units place for 8's. Let me check that again. Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. So, 8 +10(n-1) \u2264488 \u2192 10(n-1) \u2264480 \u2192 n-1 \u226448 \u2192 n \u226449. So, 49 terms. So, units place:49. Tens place: as above, 49. So, total 8's:98. So, 4's:187, 8's:98. Difference:187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that in the hundreds place, the 4's are from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. Similarly, in the tens place, 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 in the tens place. Units place:48, as 488//10=48, but since 488 ends with 8, which is after 484, the 48th occurrence is 484, so 48 times. So, 48+50+89=187. For 8's: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0, total 98. So, 187-98=89. So, the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 48 such occurrences (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, and the last 4 in the units place is 484).\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449). There are 5 such blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, and the last 8 in the units place is 488).\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488). There are 4 full blocks contributing 10 each (40 occurrences) and the last block (480-488) contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, every set of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, I should take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning there are 48 full sets of 10 pages, each contributing one 4, and then 8 extra pages (481-488). In those 8 pages, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is the 48th 4 in the units place. So, actually, it's exactly 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many full ranges there are: - 40-49: 10 pages - 140-149: 10 pages - 240-249: 10 pages - 340-349: 10 pages - 440-449: 10 pages Now, 440-449 is within 1-488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is fully within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488, so all 10 pages are included. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. Each page from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so again, 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, and then 8 extra pages (481-488). In those 8 pages, the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, because 488 is the last page, so in the 48th set, it's 480-488, which includes 488. So, that's 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last range. Let's see: - 80-89: 10 pages - 180-189: 10 pages - 280-289: 10 pages - 380-389: 10 pages - 480-488: 9 pages (since 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, the first four ranges each contribute 10 8's, and the last contributes 9. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=187-98=89. Hmm, that seems right. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (every 10th page, 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (pages 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (every 10th page, 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? Let me check: 488 is 488, so the units digit is 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484. So yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so the block 400-449 would be complete, but 450-488 would not have a full block. Let me count: - 40-49: 10 numbers - 140-149: 10 numbers - 240-249: 10 numbers - 340-349: 10 numbers - 440-449: 10 numbers So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count how many such blocks are within 488. - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 numbers - 280-289: 10 numbers - 380-389: 10 numbers. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40. But wait, does 480-488 have any 8's in the tens place? 480-488: the tens digit is 8, but the units digit varies from 0-8. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (including 488). So, that's an additional 9 numbers. So total tens place 8's: 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48+49=97. So, 97 8's in total. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 187 - 97 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems right. For 8's: units 48, tens 49, hundreds 0. 48+49=97. 187-97=90. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. And units place: 8,18,...,488: 48 numbers. So 48+49=97. For 4's, the hundreds place was 400-488, which is 89 numbers, correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449: 5 blocks, each 10, so 50. Units place: 4,14,...,484: 48 numbers. So 48+50+89=187. So 187-97=90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because I remember sometimes when counting digits, especially in the hundreds place, there might be overlaps or miscounts. Let me verify the hundreds place for 4's: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. And for 8's, hundreds place: none, since 800 is beyond 488. So yes, 0. So, 187-97=90.

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is the number of complete tens in 488. Let me calculate that: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. So, there are 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but let me check if 488 is included. The last 4 in the units place before 488 would be 484, which is indeed within the range. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one block, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another block, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, how many blocks is that? Let me count: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Because from 1-99, 40-49 is one block, that's correct. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's indeed 5 blocks. So, 5*10=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there from 400-488? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 +89=187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, but wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, the count is 49, because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 times completely (each cycle is 10 numbers), giving 48*1=48 occurrences, and then in the 49th cycle, 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the 8 in the units place is at 488. So, that's an extra 1, making it 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 occurrences. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 1-99: 80-89 is one block, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. Now, does 480-489 fall within 488? 480-489 is within 488, as 488 is the last page. So, 480-489 is another block, but wait, 480-489 would be pages 480 to 489, but our book ends at 488, so only up to 488. So, does that affect the count? Let me think. The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the numbers 480-488 have 8 in the tens place. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, the block 480-489 would contribute 9 occurrences instead of 10. So, how many blocks do we have? Let's see: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract 8's from 4's: 187 -98=89. Wait, that can't be right because 187-98=89, but let me double-check my calculations. Wait, when I counted the units place for 8's, I got 49, and for tens place, 49, so total 98. For 4's, units:48, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 187. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 8's. Let me recount the tens place 8's. The blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40, and the last block 480-488 contributes 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, 40+9=49. That seems correct. So, total 8's:49+49=98. And 4's:187. So, 187-98=89. Wait, but I feel like I might have missed something. Let me think again. For the units place of 4's: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, there's a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4. But wait, does 488 include an extra 4 in the units place? No, because 488's units digit is 8, not 4. So, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 is correct. For the tens place of 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50. That seems correct. Now, hundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, as 488-400+1=89. So, 89. So, 48+50+89=187. For 8's: units place, 49; tens place,49; hundreds,0. So, 98. 187-98=89. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place for 8's. Let me check again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? The first 8 is at 8, then 18,28,...,488. So, how many terms are in this sequence? It's an arithmetic sequence starting at 8, with a common difference of 10, up to 488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264488. So, 8 +10(n-1) \u2264488 \u219210(n-1) \u2264480 \u2192n-1 \u226448 \u2192n\u226449. So, n=49 terms. So, 49 occurrences. That's correct. So, units place for 8's is 49. Tens place for 8's: as before, 49. So, total 98. So, 4's:187, 8's:98. Difference:89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 8's would have some, but since the book only goes up to 488, 800-899 isn't included, so no 8's in the hundreds place. So, yeah, 98 8's. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's. But let me think again: 4's total 187, 8's total 98, so 187-98=89. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the answer is 89.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Number of blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 49 times (including 488).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Number of blocks: 5 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488).\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences except the last block, which contributes 9 (480-488).\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **89**.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles of 10. In each cycle, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last cycle is 480-488, and 484 is within this cycle, so it's included. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block of 100 numbers has exactly 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 1 to 488, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 1-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers) 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers) 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers) 400-488: 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers as well. So, how many blocks? Each hundred block contributes 10. From 1-99, that's 1 block, 100-199 is another, 200-299 another, 300-399 another, and 400-488 is part of the fifth block. So that's 5 blocks. Each contributes 10, so 5*10=50. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's from 400 to 488. Let's see, 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Wait, but actually, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many. From 1 to 488, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles. Each cycle has one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's included in the 48. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block of 100 has 10 such numbers. How many blocks? From 1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers) 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers) 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers) 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers) 400-488: 480-489, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480-488). So, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks (1-399) each have 10, so 4*10=40. Then, the last block (400-488) has 9. So, total tens place 8's: 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48+49=97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) minus 97 (number of 8's) equals 90. So, 90 more 4's are printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the Digit 4:**\n- **Units Place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded down to 48).\n- **Tens Place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., with 10 occurrences per 100 numbers.

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles of 10, and then 8 more numbers (481-488). In each cycle, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times from the full cycles, plus one more in the partial cycle (484). So, total 49 times in the units place. Wait, let me check that. From 1 to 480, that's 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more, making it 49. Okay, so 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is only 10 numbers, but 440 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. Each number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's count how many. From 1 to 488, how many multiples of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, in the last partial cycle (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these. Each block is 10 numbers. From 1-488, how many such blocks? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. But wait, 380-389 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 40 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, 89 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 99.

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the total number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, it's 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last group is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, does that affect the count? Hmm, actually, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 times because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so 488 is page 488, which ends with 8, not 4, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the end, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, each hundred has a range where the tens digit is 4, and each contributes 10 numbers. From 0-488, how many hundreds are there? Well, 488 is in the 400-499 range, but since we only go up to 488, the 440-449 range is still within 400-488. So, the number of ranges is 5: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 4 appears 187 times. Now, let's do the same for 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, and 488 ends with 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, 10. From 200-299: 280-289, 10. From 300-399: 380-389, 10. From 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, 480-488 is 9 numbers. Wait, so in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is included. So, for the tens place, the first four ranges (0-399) each contribute 10 numbers, so 4 x 10 = 40. Then, the last range (400-488) contributes 9 numbers. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 times. Adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484) \u2192 48 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., contributing 10 per range.

So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers.

Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can also be 4. That would be pages 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, the units digit 8 appears in 8,18,...,488. Let's count how many: starting from 8, each 10 numbers. The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence? Wait, no. Let's think: 8 is the first, then 18 (2nd), 28 (3rd), ..., 488 is the 49th? Wait, no, because from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? Let's see: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. Wait, but earlier with 4's, we had 48 in units place. But here, it's 49. Because 488 is included. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many such blocks. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 full blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9. Each full block contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the partial block contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 8? Wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 4 (for 400-488) or lower. So, 8 cannot appear in the hundreds place because the highest hundreds digit is 4. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=187-98=89. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check the units place for 4's again. From 1 to 488, how many 4's in the units place? The numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Wait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. I thought it was 48, but it's actually 49. Because 484 is the 49th term. So, units place for 4's is 49, not 48. That changes things. So, let me recalculate the 4's. Units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place:89. Total 4's=49+50+89=188. Similarly, for 8's, units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. So, difference=188-98=90. Wait, so I think I initially miscalculated the units place for 4's. It should be 49, not 48, because 484 is included. So, the correct total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90. Let me confirm again: units place for 4's: 4,14,...,484. Number of terms: ((484-4)/10)+1=(480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each with 10 4's, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Total 4's:49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place:8,18,...,488. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1=(480/10)+1=48+1=49. Tens place:80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 4 full blocks (each 10) and one partial block (9). So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total 8's=49+49=98. So, difference=188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Each block contributes 10 4's, and there are 5 such blocks, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal number of 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences (since 488 is included).\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The last block contributes 9 numbers, so total occurrences are 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal number of 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, the total number is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, so each block contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's a total of 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's, so 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, the last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, because 8 is the first occurrence at 8, then 18, ..., 488 is the 49th. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many blocks: 80-89 (1 block), 180-189 (2), 280-289 (3), 380-389 (4), and 480-488 (5). Each block except the last one has 10 numbers. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, the first four blocks contribute 4 x 10 = 40, and the last block contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: Units place: 48, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. Total: 187. For 8's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 49, Hundreds place: 0. Total: 98. Difference: 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, seems correct. But let me verify the tens place for 8's again. The blocks are 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. Similarly, for 4's in the tens place, we have 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). So, 5 blocks, each 10, totaling 50. Correct. Units place for 4's: 48, since 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens. Units place for 8's: 488 is the last page, which is 8 in the units place, so 49 times. So, yes, 49. So, 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 48 occurrences (every 10 numbers up to 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 49 occurrences (8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. If I divide 488 by 10, I get 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10, and then 8 extra numbers. In those 8 extra numbers (481-488), does the units digit reach 4? Yes, 484 is within this range. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, that makes sense because from 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4, and then 484 adds another 4. So, 49 in total. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, we have 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 blocks, 50 numbers, so 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 up to 488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's printed. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds place again. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In the extra numbers, 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Each block except the last one has 10 numbers, but the last block has 9 numbers (480-488). Let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place starting from 800, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's printed. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, there are 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last number, and 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 times. But wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (1-10, 11-20,..., 481-490). But 490 is beyond 488, so maybe it's 48 times. Hmm, but wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit goes up to 8. So, in each set of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many sets of 10 are there? From 1 to 488, that's 488 numbers. Divided by 10, that's 48 full sets, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 488, but 440-449 is 10 numbers. So, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This happens from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Wait, but actually, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. So, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places for 4: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187 times. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. Units: 48 times, tens: 50 times, hundreds: 89 times. So, 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. Hmm, seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, but now looking for 8's. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Again, every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8. So, 48 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so the last number is 488, which is the 48th cycle. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking for 8 in the tens place. This happens in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but 480-489: 480 to 488 is within 488, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many ranges? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers. So, that's 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9. So, total is 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. So, total number of 8's is 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97 times. Now, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. So, the difference is 187 - 97 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each step again. For 4's: Units: 48, Tens: 50, Hundreds:89. Total: 187. For 8's: Units:48, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total:97. Difference:187-97=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check: From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488-400+1=89. So, that's correct. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. For the tens place of 4's: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. For units place: 48 times. So, 48+50+89=187. For 8's: Units place:48 times, correct. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again: in the hundreds place for 8's, there are none, so that's correct. And for 4's, hundreds place is 89, which is correct. So, yeah, I think 90 is the correct difference.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 187 - 97 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place would be 488 divided by 10, but since 488 isn't a multiple of 10, I should take the integer part. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, the last set would be 481-490, but since the book ends at 488, the units digit 4 appears once more in 484. So actually, it's 49 times? Wait, no, because 488 \u00f7 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but we have an extra 4 in 484, making it 49. Wait, let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 instances of 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Since the book ends at 488, 449 is within the range, so yes, that's a full block. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, 8,18,28,...,488. Let's count how many. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 instances. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 4 x 10 = 40. Now, wait, does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. So, that's 9 numbers (480-488) where the tens digit is 8. So, in the tens place, we have four full blocks (80-89, etc.) contributing 40, and then an additional 9 in 480-488. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me verify: from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 times. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Well, starting from 4, every 10th number has a 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does this happen? Let me calculate. The total number of 4's in the units place would be the number of complete groups of 10, plus any extra if the last number is beyond that. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10, which gives 48 times, and then in the 49th group (481-490), the 484 is within this range, so that's one more. Wait, no, actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for units place, the number of 4's is floor(488/10) = 48 times, because 488/10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 have a 4 in the units place? No, 488 ends with 8. So, the last 4 in the units place would be 484, which is within 480-489, but 488 is the end, so 484 is included. So, units place 4's: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? Let's see. The first range is 40-49, which is within 1-99. Then 140-149 (100-199), 240-249 (200-299), 340-349 (300-399), and 440-449 (400-488). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, how many ranges is that? From 40-49: 1 range, then each subsequent hundred adds another range. So, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fit within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times. So, tens place 4's: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, hundreds place 4's: 89 times. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Wait, let me add that again: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, does 488 end with 8? Yes, 488 is the last page, so that's included. So, units place 8's: 48 +1 = 49 times? Wait, no. Because from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (each contributing one 8), and then the 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me think. For units digit 8, the numbers are 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms are there? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. So, number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place 8's: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. This occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many full ranges and partial ranges. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, total tens place 8's: 4 full ranges (each 10) and one partial range of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9 (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place 8's: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's:187, total 8's:98. So, 187 -98=89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:187\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:98\n\nDifference:187-98=89.\n\nWait, but let me verify the tens place for 4's. I said 5 ranges: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 ranges, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 4 full ranges (40) and 9, total 49. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's:48, because 488/10=48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing a 4 in the units place. The last 4 in units place is 484, which is within 488, so no extra. Wait, earlier I thought 488 is the last page, so units place 4's would be 48 times, not 49. Wait, let me recalculate units place for 4's.\n\nUnits place 4's: from 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Wait, that contradicts my earlier calculation. Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me clarify.\n\nWhen counting how many times a digit appears in the units place, it's the number of times the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, for units digit 4, the numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? Let's see: starting at 4, each step is +10. So, the nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. We need the last term \u2264488. So, 4 + (n-1)*10 \u2264488 \u21d2 (n-1)*10 \u2264484 \u21d2 n-1 \u226448.4 \u21d2 n \u226449.4, so n=49. So, units place 4's:49 times.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 48, but now it's 49. That's a mistake. So, units place 4's:49.\n\nSimilarly, for units place 8's: from 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 + (n-1)*10=488 \u21d2 (n-1)*10=480 \u21d2 n-1=48 \u21d2 n=49. So, units place 8's:49.\n\nSo, correcting the earlier mistake, units place 4's:49, not 48.\n\nSimilarly, tens place 4's:50, as before.\n\nHundreds place 4's:89, as before.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nWait, that's different from before. Let me recalculate:\n\n4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so earlier I had 187-98=89, but now it's 188-98=90. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial count of units place 4's. Let me confirm.\n\nYes, the units place for 4's should be 49, not 48, because 488 is the last page, and 484 is the last 4 in units place, which is the 49th term. So, units place 4's:49.\n\nSimilarly, units place 8's:49.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 187, but that was incorrect because I miscounted the units place 4's as 48 instead of 49.\n\nSo, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again.\n\nUnits place 4's: numbers are 4,14,...,484. How many terms? Let's calculate:\n\nFirst term a=4, common difference d=10, last term l=484.\n\nNumber of terms n is given by l = a + (n-1)d \u21d2 484=4 + (n-1)*10 \u21d2 480=(n-1)*10 \u21d2 n-1=48 \u21d2 n=49.\n\nSo, 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, units place 8's:8,18,...,488. Last term is 488.\n\nUsing the same formula: l=488, a=8, d=10.\n\n488=8 + (n-1)*10 \u21d2 480=(n-1)*10 \u21d2 n-1=48 \u21d2 n=49.\n\nSo, units place 8's:49.\n\nTens place 4's:5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 50.\n\nHundreds place 4's:400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nTens place:4 ranges of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) plus 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10=40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89, but now it's 90. Let me check again.\n\nYes, because units place 4's are 49, not 48, so total 4's are 188, and 8's are 98, so difference is 90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is calculated by examining each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately. Similarly, the number of times the digit 8 appears is counted. The difference between the counts of 4's and 8's is then determined.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers (since 484 is the 49th term in this sequence).\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers (since 488 is the 49th term in this sequence).\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges each contribute 10 numbers, and the last range contributes 9 numbers, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - The number of 4's exceeds the number of 8's by 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.  \n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? Let me check: 488 ends with an 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times the digit 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99, there's one range (40-49). From 100-199, another (140-149), and so on up to 400-488. Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, but 450-488 is beyond that. So, how many complete ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, but the last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, 1 to 488: 8 appears in the units place 49 times? Wait, let me check: 8,18,...,488. The first is 8 (1), then 18 (2), ..., 488 is the 49th because (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which is 480-488. Let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is included). So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 times. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, but wait, when I counted the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, but let me check: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, right? From 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers (480 is the first, 488 is the ninth). So, 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place in the 480-488 range. So, yes, 49 times total for 8's. So, 187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct. So, I think the calculation is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the Digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Total occurrences: \\( \\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\rfloor = 48 \\).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Total occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 \\).\n\n**Counting the Digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n   - Total occurrences: \\( \\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, except 480-488, which contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers in 800-899, so 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:** \\( 187 - 98 = 89 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have exactly one 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, I think we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's five blocks. But wait, the last block is only up to 488, so from 440-449, that's a full block, and then 450-488 doesn't have a 4 in the tens place. So, each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, from 40-49 is one block, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's actually five blocks, each contributing 10, so 5\u00d710=50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place only in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, but 400 is the first, and 488 is the last, so yes, 89 numbers. So, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's are 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full occurrences. The last 8 in the units place is at 488, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count these blocks. From 0-99: 80-89 is one block, contributing 10 8's. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), so that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 10+10=20+10=30+10=40+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, total 8's are 97. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., but the last block (480-488) has only 9 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book doesn't reach 800.\n\nTotal 8's = 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? 488 ends with an 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484. So, yes, 48 times. Wait, but let me check: starting from 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. So, the first is 4, and the last is 484. How many terms are there? The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so that's 49 times. I think I made a mistake earlier by just dividing 488 by 10. So, correct count for units place 4's is 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count these blocks. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? Well, in the hundreds place, we can have 0 (for pages 1-99), 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, but pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit, so the tens digit can be 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, for each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, etc.), the tens digit 4 appears in 10 numbers each. So, from 100-499, that's 4 sets (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-499). But our book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 400-488. Let's check how many numbers in 400-488 have a tens digit of 4. That would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total blocks with tens digit 4 are:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249: 10\n- 340-349: 10\n- 440-449: 10\n\nWait, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Wait, but the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, let's add up all the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me double-check that addition: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Okay, that seems right.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through each digit position similarly.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's count these. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book goes only up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count each block:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nWait, so the first four blocks each have 10 numbers, but the last block has only 9 because 489 is beyond 488. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. When I count 80-89, that's 10 numbers, right? 80 to 89 inclusive is 10 numbers. Similarly, each subsequent block. But in 480-488, how many numbers have an 8 in the tens place? The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but hold on. When I count the tens place, I included 80-89, which are 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. Similarly for 180-189, etc. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49+49=98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 4's was 89, which is correct because from 400 to 488 is 89 numbers. But for 8's, there's no hundreds digit, so that's 0.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. I counted 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nAnd for the units place, 4's: from 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers, as calculated.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, units place: 49 numbers, and tens place: 49 numbers.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, 8's:98, difference 90.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Correct, each has a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check if 488 is included. Yes, 488 is the last page, so it's included in the hundreds place count.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place of 4's, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct.\n\nHmm, I think my calculations are correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block has 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks have 10 numbers each, and the last block (480-488) has 9 numbers.\n   - Total: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book only goes up to 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** 90 more 4's are printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles of 10, and then 8 extra numbers. In each cycle, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial cycle (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484). So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, which means there are 4 full hundreds, and then 88 extra numbers. In each hundred, the 4 in the tens place occurs in 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, 4 hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 occurrences. Now, in the last 88 numbers (400-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's another 10 numbers. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 only in 400-488, but each of these numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many times. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial cycle (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included. So, that's one more 8. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, 9 occurrences. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

So, the number of 4's in the units place is the total number of tens in 488, which is 488 divided by 10, but since we're only counting the units digit, it's actually 48 complete sets of 10, which gives 48.

So, that's 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another range. So, that's 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is only up to 449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400 to 488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? From 1 to 488, the number of 8's in the units place is the number of complete tens. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but we take the integer part, which is 48. So, 48 8's in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, which ends with 8, so that's included. So, 488 is the 48th occurrence of 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is one range. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: Hmm, 480-489 would be another range, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, 480-488 is part of that range. So, that's another range. So, total ranges: 5. Each range contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens place 8's are from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), not 10. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, actually, in the hundreds place, for the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8's are only 9 numbers. So, that would be 4 ranges with 10 8's each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one range with 9 8's (480-488). So, total 4\u00d710 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, total 97 8's. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 4's, totaling 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in page numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = **49**.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in 800-899, so 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **97**.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers will have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but does 488 include a 4 in the units place? 488 ends with an 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. Let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each set of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. For example, 40-49 is 10 numbers, then 140-149 is another 10, and so on. So, how many hundreds are there? From 1 to 488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So that's 4 times 10, which is 40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 440-449. So, that's another 10. So total 40 + 10 = 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 4 appears 187 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, does 488 count as an 8 in the units place? Yes, because 488 ends with 8. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full hundred has 10 occurrences. From 1-400, that's 4 sets of 100, so 4*10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up the occurrences of 8: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 187 - 97 is 90. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98+89=187. For 8's: units 48, tens 49, hundreds 0. 48+49=97. So, 187 - 97 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each set of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - From 1-400: 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - From 401-488: 440-449 contributes 10.\n   - Total: 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 times.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - From 1-400: 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - From 401-488: 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 times.\n\n**Total 8's:** 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n**Difference:**\n- More 4's than 8's: 187 - 97 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, it's 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 48 times 10 is 480, and the next number would be 484, which is within 488, so that's 49 times? Wait, no, because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the number of times the units digit is 4 is 48 full times plus one more for 484, making it 49 times. Wait, but let me think again. If I take 488 divided by 10, it's 48.8, which means 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once at 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, the last block is 401-500, but since we only go up to 488, the 401-488 part still includes the tens digit 4 from 401-410, 420-429, etc., but actually, in the 400s, the tens digit 4 would be from 440-449. Wait, no, that's not right. The tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. But since the book only goes up to 488, the 440-449 block is fully included, right? So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, 5 blocks. So, 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but earlier I thought 488/100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds, but actually, it's 4 full hundreds (1-400) and then 401-488. So, in 1-400, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, which is 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers, so total 40 + 10 = 50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for page numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, and then in the last partial cycle (481-488), 488 is included, so that's one more. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Additionally, in the 400s, the tens digit 8 would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but in the tens place, 480-488 has the tens digit as 8? Wait, 480 is 4-8-0, so tens digit is 8. 481 is 4-8-1, so tens digit is 8. Similarly up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8 in the 400s. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me confirm. In the 400s, the tens digit 8 is only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 40 from the earlier blocks plus 9 from the last partial block, total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract 98 from 188: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear \u2192 0 times.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, I think it's 48 times. Wait, but actually, 488 is the last page, so 488 divided by 10 is 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then 8 more pages (481-488) which don't add another 4 in the units place. So, units place 4's: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. 100-199: 140-149. 200-299: 240-249. 300-399: 340-349. 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but in the last block, 440-449, does 449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's fine. So, tens place 4's: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. Each page number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, hundreds place 4's: 89 times. Now, total 4's = units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Wait, let me check that again. Units: 48, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. Adding them up: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that happens. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. The last group is 481-490, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, units place 8's: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is one block. 100-199: 180-189. 200-299: 280-289. 300-399: 380-389. 400-488: Now, does 480-489 exist? Yes, but 480-489 is within 488. So, 480-489 is another block, but since the book ends at 488, the last number is 488, which is within this block. So, how many full blocks? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 includes 480-489 up to 488. So, that's another block. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, in the 400-488 range, the 80-89 in the tens place would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, does that affect the count? Let me think. The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last number is 488, which still has an 8 in the tens place. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought each block contributes 10, but in this case, it's only 9. Hmm, that's a mistake. Let me correct that. So, for the hundreds place, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can be 8, but only up to 488. So, the block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, in the tens place, for the hundreds digit 4, we have 9 numbers instead of 10. So, how does that affect the total count? Let me recalculate. For the tens place:\n\n- 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 50. So, I need to adjust that. So, tens place 8's: 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0 times.\n\nNow, total 8's = units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 49 + 0 = 97 times.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 48, Tens place: 49, Hundreds place: 0. So, 48 + 49 is 97. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 187\n\nTotal 8's: 97\n\nDifference: 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. Let me recount:\n\n- 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10\n- 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10\n- 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10\n- 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10\n- 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, we had 5 blocks each contributing 10, so 50, which is correct because 440-449 is fully within 488.\n\nWait, but in the 4's hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\nTotal 8's: 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have missed something in the units place for 8's. Let me check again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, how many such numbers are there? The last one is 488, which is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 8. So, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so that's the 49th occurrence? Wait, no, because starting from 8 as the first, then 18 is the second, so up to 488 would be 49 times. Wait, let me see: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place 8's: 49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48. That's a mistake. So, I need to correct that.\n\nSo, units place 8's: 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, units place 4's: Let's recalculate. From 4,14,24,...,484. The last one is 484, which is 484 = 4 + 10*(n-1). So, n = (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place 4's: 49 times.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought units place 4's were 48, but actually, it's 49. Let me confirm that.\n\nYes, because starting at 4, each 10 numbers add another 4 in the units place. So, 4,14,24,...,484. That's 49 numbers because 484 is the 49th term. So, units place 4's: 49.\n\nSimilarly, units place 8's: 49.\n\nSo, that changes the counts.\n\nLet me redo the counts with this correction.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n1. Units place: 49 times.\n\n2. Tens place: 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 4's. So, 5*10=50.\n\n3. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n1. Units place: 49 times.\n\n2. Tens place: 5 blocks, but the last block (480-488) has 9 numbers instead of 10. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place 4's were 49 and units place 8's were 49, but in my initial calculation, I had 48 for 4's and 48 for 8's, which was incorrect. So, the correct counts are 49 each for units place, leading to 188 4's and 98 8's, difference of 90.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure about the units place counts. Let's list them out for a smaller range to see if the formula is correct.\n\nFor example, from 1 to 20:\n\nNumbers ending with 4: 4,14 \u2192 2 times.\n\nUsing the formula: (20 - 4)/10 +1 = 16/10 +1 = 1.6 +1=2.6, which is not an integer. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the formula should be floor((n - a)/d) +1, where a is the first occurrence, d is the step.\n\nSo, for 4's in units place up to n:\n\nNumber of 4's = floor((n - 4)/10) +1 if n >=4, else 0.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nNumber of 8's = floor((n -8)/10)+1 if n>=8, else 0.\n\nLet me test this with n=20.\n\nFor 4's: floor((20-4)/10)+1 = floor(16/10)+1=1+1=2. Correct, 4 and 14.\n\nFor 8's: floor((20-8)/10)+1= floor(12/10)+1=1+1=2. Correct, 8 and 18.\n\nSimilarly, for n=488:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place: floor((488-4)/10)+1 = floor(484/10)+1=48+1=49.\n\nNumber of 8's in units place: floor((488-8)/10)+1= floor(480/10)+1=48+1=49.\n\nSo, that's correct. So, units place 4's:49, units place 8's:49.\n\nTherefore, earlier correction was right, so total 4's:188, 8's:98, difference 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. In the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, in the tens place, for the 400-488 range, it's 9, not 10. So, total tens place 8's:10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nTotal 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The last block contributes 9 occurrences instead of 10 because the book ends at 488. Total tens place 8's = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, I can divide 488 by 10 to find how many complete cycles there are, which gives 48 full cycles (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles). Each cycle has exactly one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? 488 ends with an 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484, which is within the 488 limit. So, units place gives 48 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? Well, from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's five blocks. Wait, but the last block is only up to 488, not 499. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449. Let me check: 400-449 would be 50 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, each of the first four blocks (40-49, 140-149, etc.) contributes 10 fours, and the fifth block (440-449) also contributes 10 fours. So, that's 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. That's 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 fours in total. Now, I'll do the same process for the digit 8. Let's count the number of 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the fours, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? Again, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8 in the units place. The last 8 in the units place is 488, which is included, so that's 48 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is one block. 100-199: 180-189. 200-299: 280-289. 300-399: 380-389. 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, so in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, how many blocks? The first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, and the fifth block (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, total eights are 97. Now, to find how many more fours than eights there are: 187 fours - 97 eights = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 187-97 is 90, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours and eights. For fours: units place: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For eights: units place:48, tens:49, hundreds:0. 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. Hmm, but I have a feeling I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for fours. Wait, when counting the tens place for fours, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks, each with 10 fours, so 5\u00d710=50. That seems correct. For eights, in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks each have 10 eights, and the last block has 9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. That seems correct. So, 48 units eights, 49 tens eights, total 97. So, 187 fours minus 97 eights is indeed 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because 488 is a three-digit number, and I'm not sure if I considered all the hundreds correctly. Let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. That seems correct. For eights, no hundreds place contributions. So, yes, the difference is 90. But wait, let me think again. When counting the tens place for fours, I included 440-449, which is correct because 440 is within 488. Similarly, for eights, 480-488 is correct. So, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the number of fours printed is 90 more than the number of eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total cycles: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 full cycles.\n   - Each cycle contributes 1 '4', so 48 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 100: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block has 10 '4's, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total cycles: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 full cycles.\n   - Each cycle contributes 1 '8', so 48 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 100: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 '8's each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 '8's.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, there are 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full tens and then 8 more pages. So, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, that's 48 times. But wait, does 488 have a 4 in the units place? No, because 488 ends with 8, so the last 4 in the units place is indeed 484. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place (second digit):** The 4 can appear in the tens place for every block of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, which means there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, the last hundred is 401-500, but the book only goes up to 488, so the 440-449 block is fully included, right? Yes, because 440-449 is within 1-488. So, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40 times. 3. **Hundreds place (third digit):** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times. Wait, but let me check: 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units (48) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 40 = 88; 88 + 89 = 177. So, there are 177 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that happens. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full cycles, each contributing an 8 in the units place. But wait, the last page is 488, which ends with 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 when counting from 8. Let me check: 8*1=8, 8*2=16, ..., 8*49=392, but wait, no, that's not the right way. Actually, the units digit cycles every 10, so from 1 to 488, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is the number of times the units digit is 8. That would be every 10 pages: 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many terms are there? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The number of terms can be found by ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place (second digit):** The 8 can appear in the tens place for every block of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, meaning there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, the last hundred is 401-500, but the book ends at 488, so the 480-489 block is partially included. Wait, but 480-489 would be the next block after 380-389, but since the book only goes up to 488, the tens digit 8 in the 400s occurs from 480-489, but 488 is the last page. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 in these 9 numbers. Therefore, the tens place count is 4 blocks (each 10) plus 9, so 4*10=40 +9=49. Wait, but let me think again. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in the following blocks:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, totaling 4*10 +9=49 times. So, tens place: 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (third digit):** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nNow, adding up the number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 177 (4's) -98 (8's)=79. So, there are 79 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor the 4's:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 40\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:48+40=88+89=177. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98. That also seems correct.\n\nDifference:177-98=79. So, the answer should be 79 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for 4's again. I had 48 times. But let me think: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then every 10. So, 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. Wait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. I thought it was 48, but actually, it's 49. Because 484 is the 49th term. So, units place for 4's is 49, not 48. That changes things.\n\nWait, so let me correct that:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place:49.\n\nThen, tens place:40.\n\nHundreds place:89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+40=89+89=178.\n\nWait, that's different. So, I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, units place was 49, tens place 49, so total 98.\n\nSo, difference is 178 -98=80.\n\nWait, so I think I initially miscalculated the units place for 4's. Let me confirm.\n\nThe units digit cycles every 10. The first 4 is at 4, then 14,24,...,484. So, how many terms?\n\nThe formula is ((last - first)/step) +1.\n\nSo, ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, units place was correct at 49.\n\nSo, 4's:49 (units)+40 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=178.\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)=98.\n\nDifference:178-98=80.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is 80 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400+1=89. So, yes, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd for the tens place, 40 times. So, 49+40=89+89=178.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's tens place was 40, which is correct because each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, and there are 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40.\n\nSo, 4's total is 49+40+89=178.\n\n8's: units 49, tens 49, so 98.\n\nDifference:178-98=80.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is 80 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place (second digit):**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 100: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 4 full blocks (1-400).\n   - Total: 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (third digit):**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 178 times.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place (second digit):**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 100: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (third digit):**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 times.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98 times.\n\n**Difference:** 178 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 80.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{80}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have exactly one 4 in the units place. So, total number of 4's in the units place would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but the last group would be 480-488, which includes 484 as the 4 in the units place. So actually, there are 49 instances where 4 appears in the units place because 488 is included. Wait, no, because 488 is 488, which is 488, so the units digit is 8, not 4. So, the last 4 in the units place would be 484, which is 484. So, from 1 to 484, every 10 numbers, there's a 4 in the units place. So, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, which would mean 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, 484 is the 48th group, right? Because 480-489 would be the 48th group, but we're only going up to 488. So, in the units place, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. That would be from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 times. Now, let's add up the 4's: units place 48, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. So total 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Wait, let me check that addition: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. Okay, so 187 times 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place would be 488. So, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, there's an 8 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 times. Wait, because 488 is 8 in the units place, so yes, 49 times. Wait, let me think again: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. That would be ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many such ranges: From 1-99: 80-89, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, 10. From 200-299: 280-289, 10. From 300-399: 380-389, 10. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, each of the first four ranges contributes 10, and the last contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit can be 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. So total 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's: 187, total 8's: 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: Units place: 48, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. Total 187. For 8's: Units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. Total 98. Difference: 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, but let me think again about the units place for 4's. When I counted 48, I thought that 484 is the last one, but 488 is 488, so 484 is included. So, from 1 to 484, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. 484 / 10 = 48.4, so 48 times, but actually, 484 is the 48th occurrence, so that's correct. Wait, but 488 is 488, so 488 is 8 in the units place, so 488 is included in the 8's count. So, for 4's in the units place, it's 48 times, correct. For 8's in the units place, it's 49 times, because 488 is included. So, that seems correct. For the tens place, 4's: 50 times, as we have 5 ranges each contributing 10. 8's in the tens place: 49 times, because the last range is only 9 numbers. So, that's correct. So, total 4's: 187, 8's: 98. Difference: 89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding how many more 4's are printed than 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 48 complete groups of 10 within 488, but since 484 is included, it's 48 times.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). Since 488 is included, there are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 complete ranges contributing 10 each and one incomplete range (480-488) contributing 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's = 187\n   - Number of 8's = 98\n   - Difference = 187 - 98 = 89\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, I can divide 488 by 10 to get the number of complete cycles. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so there are 48 complete cycles and a partial cycle of 8 numbers. In each complete cycle, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 times. Now, in the partial cycle from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 is within this range, which adds one more 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449. Let me count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, so from 0-99: 40-49 is one set. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five sets. Each set contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 times. But wait, I need to check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, total 4's in tens place: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Wait, actually, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in each of these, the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's 89 times. Wait, let me check: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times. So, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's. Every 10 numbers, the units digit is 8. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Now, the partial cycle from 481-488: units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. So, that's one more 8 in the units place. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such sets there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is one set. From 100-199: 180-189 is another. Similarly, 280-289 and 380-389. So, that's four sets. Each set has 10 numbers, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, does 480-489 exist? Well, our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the hundreds place. But the tens digit in 480-488 is 8, right? So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Wait, but I think I might have already counted up to 488 in the hundreds place. Wait, no, the tens place is separate. So, in the hundreds place, we have 400-488, but in the tens place, for 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's an additional 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Wait, but let me make sure. The first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 numbers, so 40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but let me check that again. Units: 49, Tens: 49, so 98 total 8's. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again. For 4's: Units: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total 188. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. That seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the total number of page numbers divided by 10, which is 488 / 10 = 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, we'll take the integer part, which is 48 times. Wait, but actually, 488 is the last page. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then an extra 8 pages. So, from 1 to 480, that's 48 times 4 in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again. So, total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100, so 488 / 100 = 4.88, which means 4 full blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399). Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 blocks give 4*10=40. But wait, the last block is 400-499, but our book ends at 488, so the tens digit 4 in 400-488 is still 10 times (400-409, 410-419, etc., up to 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but we're considering the tens digit as 4. So, actually, the tens digit being 4 occurs in 400-409, 410-419, ..., 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is still within 488. Wait, no, 440-449 is within 488, but 450-459 would be next, but the tens digit is 5 there. Wait, no, the tens digit cycles every 10 numbers, so in 400-409, tens digit is 0, then 410-419 is 1, up to 440-449 is 4, and then 450-459 is 5, etc. Wait, actually, no, the tens digit in 400-499 is determined by the second digit. So, 400-409: tens digit 0, 410-419: tens digit 1, 420-429: tens digit 2, 430-439: tens digit 3, 440-449: tens digit 4, 450-459: tens digit 5, etc., up to 480-489: tens digit 8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, including that, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? Let's see:\n\n- 40-49: 10 times\n- 140-149: 10 times\n- 240-249: 10 times\n- 340-349: 10 times\n- 440-449: 10 times\n\nBut wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 times. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 times, so 5*10=50. Wait, but earlier I thought 4 blocks, but actually, from 0-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 blocks. So, 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 5 blocks, each 10 numbers, so 50 times. So, the tens digit 4 appears 50 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 488/100=4.88, so 4 full hundreds, but actually, 488 is more than 400, so the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is the fifth block. So, total 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\nWait, but let me check again. From 1-488, how many times does the tens digit 4 occur?\n\n- 40-49: 10\n- 140-149:10\n- 240-249:10\n- 340-349:10\n- 440-449:10\n\nSo, 5 blocks, each 10, so 50.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 400 is included, and 488 is the last page. So, 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place:89.\n\nNow, summing up the 4's:\n\nUnits:48, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total 4's=48+50+89=187.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nSimilarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488.\n\nHow many such numbers are there? From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10, so 488/10=48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, and then an extra 8 in 488. So, 48+1=49 times.\n\nWait, let me check: 1-480 has 480 numbers, which is 48*10, so 48 eights in the units place. Then, 481-488 includes 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, total 48+1=49.\n\nSo, units place:49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, let's count:\n\n- 80-89:10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, total tens place 8's:10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, tens place:49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, hundreds place:0.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:187, total 8's:98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 48+50=98, 98+89=187.\n\n8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98.\n\nSo, 187-98=89.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n\n1. **Units place:** \n   - The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 full cycles of 10, contributing 48 instances.\n   \n2. **Tens place:** \n   - The digit '4' appears in blocks of 10 numbers where the tens digit is '4' (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n   - There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 instances, totaling 50.\n   \n3. **Hundreds place:** \n   - The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 instances.\n\n**Total '4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**\n\n**Counting the digit '8':**\n\n1. **Units place:** \n   - The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 full cycles of 10, contributing 48 instances, plus one more in 488, totaling 49.\n   \n2. **Tens place:** \n   - The digit '8' appears in blocks of 10 numbers where the tens digit is '8' (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n   - There are 5 such blocks, but the last block (480-488) has only 9 numbers. Thus, total instances are 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n   \n3. **Hundreds place:** \n   - The digit '8' does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = **89**\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, I can divide 488 by 10 to find how many complete cycles there are. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a cycle, there are 48 complete cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 48 cycles would take us up to 480, and then we have 481-488. In the 49th cycle (481-490), the units digit 4 appears at 484. So, that's one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49 (1 block), 140-149 (another), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete cycles, each giving one 8. But we also have 488, which is another 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 8's in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1 to 488, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's here. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 89 (8's) = 99. Therefore, there are 99 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - There are 49 occurrences (48 full cycles of 10, plus one in 484).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 5 blocks.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - There are 49 occurrences (48 full cycles of 10, plus one in 488).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 4 blocks.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 40 (tens) = **89**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 89 (8's) = **99**\n\n\\boxed{99}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a digit, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning there are 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But actually, from 1 to 480, it's exactly 48 times, and then from 481 to 488, there's another 4 at 484. So, that's 49 times. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as (488 // 10) + 1 if 488 mod 10 >= 4. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. Since 8 is greater than or equal to 4, we add 1 more, making it 49. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, for 10 consecutive numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are up to 488. The blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5 * 10 = 50. However, wait, the last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many times. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, contributing 48 8's. Then, from 481 to 488, the next 8 is at 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, for 10 consecutive numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers instead of 10. So, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89 is one block, 180-189 another, 280-289 another, 380-389 another, and 480-488. That's five blocks. The first four blocks each contribute 10 8's, and the last block contributes 9 8's. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only when the page number is from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles of 10, and then 8 extra numbers. Each cycle contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial cycle (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total 4's in units place = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, that's not right. Because from 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of 10, so 48 fours in the units place. Then from 481 to 488, that's 8 numbers, and 484 is one of them, so that's 1 more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 440-449. Let's see: Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48. But wait, in the last partial cycle (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included, which is one more 8. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges, so 4 x 10 = 40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 89. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 89 = 99. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: Units: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total 188. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:40, Hundreds:0. Total 89. So, 188 - 89 = 99. Hmm, but let me check the units place for 4's again. From 1 to 488, how many 4's in units place? The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. That's correct. Similarly, for 8's in units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is 8 + 10*(n-1)=488, so 10*(n-1)=480, n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place for 4's: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Tens place for 8's: 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 380-389. That's 4 sets, each with 10, so 40 eights. Hundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Hundreds place for 8's: 0. So, total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Total 8's:49+40+0=89. So, difference is 188-89=99. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

But wait, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? Let me check: 488 ends with an 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484. So, yes, 48 times. So, 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. 100-199: 140-149 is another. 200-299: 240-249. 300-399: 340-349. 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles. But wait, 488 is included, so the last number with an 8 in the units place is 488. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. The number of terms in this sequence can be found by (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count the blocks: 0-99: 80-89 is one block, contributing 10 8's. 100-199: 180-189, another 10. 200-299: 280-289, another 10. 300-399: 380-389, another 10. 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, so 4\u00d710=40, and the last block contributes 9. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, let me double-check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 98 8's. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. Let me just quickly verify my calculations to make sure I didn't miss anything. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 187-98=89. Yep, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 48 such numbers.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, which gives 48 fours. But wait, does the 488th page affect this? Let me check. The units digit cycles every 10, so 488 is the last page. The last number with a 4 in the units place would be 484, which is 48*10 + 4. So, yes, 48 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, the last range is 440-449, but 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, how many full decades (sets of 100) do we have? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So that's 5 sets where the tens digit is 4. Each set contributes 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's okay. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the range 400-488. How many numbers are there in this range? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 fours. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8. So, 48 eights in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does that count? 488 has an 8 in the units place, so yes, that's included in the 48th block. So, 48 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Let me check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10 eights. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (fours) - 97 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete cycles and a partial cycle. Each cycle contributes one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, in the last partial cycle (481-488), 484 is included, which is another 4. So that's 49 times. Wait, no, because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles and then 8 more numbers. So, in each full cycle, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So total 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449, right? Let me check: 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. Now, how many such sets are there? From 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, meaning 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). Each full hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49). So, 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in the numbers 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, adding that, 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but wait, 401-488 is only 88 numbers, and 440-449 is within that. So, yes, 10 more. So total 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing a 4 in the units place, so 48 numbers. Then, in the last partial cycle (481-488), 484 is the only one, so 1 more. So 48 + 1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). How many full hundreds are there? 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50. Correct. Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each has a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89. So total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then, in the last partial cycle (481-488), 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So that's one more. So total 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, in sets like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many full sets are there? From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (e.g., 80-89). So 4\u00d710=40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, adding 9, total 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 49 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 49 is 98, but let me check again. Units place: 8,18,...,488. How many? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial cycle (481-488), 488 is included, so one more. Total 49. Correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 8, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct. So total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but wait, 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. 8's: units=49, tens=49. 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484.

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place. So, I can calculate this by dividing 488 by 10, which gives 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, I think I need to check if the last group has a 4 in the units place. The last page is 488, so the last group would be 480-488. In this group, the units digits go from 0 to 8, so 484 is included, which means the 48th occurrence is at 484. So, that's 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. But wait, the last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total number of 4's is 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so integer part is 48. But wait, the last page is 488, which ends with 8, so that's the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Wait, but 488 is beyond 389, so 380-389 is the last block with 8 in the tens place before 400. So, 40 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place starting from page 800, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Therefore, total number of 8's is 48 (units) + 40 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 88. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 88 = 99. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: Units: 48, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. Total: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: Units: 48, Tens: 40, Hundreds:0. Total: 48+40=88. 187-88=99. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check if I missed any numbers. For units place of 4: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is floor(488/10) = 48. So, 48 times. Correct. For tens place of 4: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4. So, 89. Correct. For 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so 48 times. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389. That's 4 blocks, each 10, so 40. Correct. Hundreds place: none. So, 88 total. So, 187-88=99. So, 99 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in higher places, there might be overlaps or miscounts. Let me try another approach. Alternatively, I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately. Let's do that again.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: For each complete set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10 (since 488/10=48.8), so 48 4's. Plus, in the incomplete set from 481-488, the units digit 4 appears at 484, so total 48.\n\n- Tens place: For each complete set of 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 ten times. So, in each 100, there are 10 4's in the tens place (40-49, etc.). From 1-488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 in the 400s, which is another 10 numbers (440-449). Wait, no, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 40 (from 1-400) +10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. There are 89 numbers here (488-400+1=89), so 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 48+50+89=187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: Similarly, each 10 numbers contribute one 8. From 1-488, 48 full sets, so 48 8's. The last number is 488, which ends with 8, so that's included.\n\n- Tens place: Each 100 numbers have a block where the tens digit is 8, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. From 1-488, there are 4 such blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes 10 8's, so 4*10=40.\n\n- Hundreds place: As before, no 8's in hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 48+40=88.\n\nDifference: 187-88=99.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the number of 8's. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 40 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 48 + 40 = 88.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 88 (number of 8's) = 99.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{99}"
